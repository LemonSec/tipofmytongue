University

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,740
the topic answer today is a death manner

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,039
a comprehensive Global active ip6

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
address discount system

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
as we know with the green address

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,480
exhausting of ip4 IPC rp6 is being

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
deployed increasing commonly a round

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,840
rewards and the retreat will accelerate

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,460
for example

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,700
more than 37.6 percent

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,059
of Honduras assess the Google where ip6

15
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,199
in 2022

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,899
United what active address processing is

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
operate requested for network service

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,040
such as the storage system sensors

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
network marketing

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
topology measurements

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
a security reconces

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,479
and the network management

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,420
however and ip6 there are significant

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,759
significant colleges who ignite was

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,780
until address discount due to the

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,420
variety of ip6 addressed configurations

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,500
methods the West address is another low

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,180
address unit

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,619
for example E I pay for space we can

30
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,220
scan those in test space in 45 minutes

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,020
using the map

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,299
uh

33
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,820
previous six speeds this could take at

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,258
least our 1 million years

35
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,500
uh therefore word Force scanning of the

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,440
entire Acoustics class space is not

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,060
feasible

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,900
so how to quickly discover active ip6

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,540
addresses with limited property

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,079
resources

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,599
uh first we introduce the relevant terms

42
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,020
here list is IPv6 addresses addresses

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,739
built from multiple data source Center

44
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,580
address is active address as Imports or

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,220
address generation algorithms

46
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,340
Target address is possible active

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,580
address generated by a address

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,270
generation algorithm

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,330
[Music]

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,900
uh the active iv6 address probably

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
includes four models uh contraction of

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,239
the ip6 list

53
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,720
Target address generation

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,500
understanding and a last perfect Taxi

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,900
for popping the active ip6 addresses the

56
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,680
rp6 release the model constructs list

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
from multiple data source

58
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,060
list to generate a generator Target

59
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,900
addresses

60
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,519
a high speed address scanning code to

61
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
scan Target addresses to discover active

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,220
ip6 addresses

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,640
finally the last detection model removes

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,360
removes the last perfect and addresses

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,299
a newly discovered active addresses are

66
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,299
added to the list to erase a Hit List

67
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,840
further

68
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,560
however

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,299
exiting methods related to heavily

70
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,080
answered addresses and simple past

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,659
instead of Justice can lead to reduce

72
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,639
the toxic efficiency

73
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,940
how to laminate stamping bars inside

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,979
addresses it means ecology

75
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,880
graphic shows the rents or address the

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,620
taxi the purple cycle is the entire ip6

77
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,940
address space

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,780
under green circle is a global is such a

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,320
researchable perfect address space the

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,139
blue circle is the target address space

81
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,620
which contains both researchable and the

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,919
non-stageable addresses basis

83
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,280
we ended up a perfect space contains the

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,520
field side addresses the exciting method

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,699
is difficulty to uh it's difficult to

86
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,160
learn the study address the

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,840
characteristics

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,100
yes you address the taxi we are faced

89
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,740
with the Quality Tool the load or the

90
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,800
taxi efficiency of anxiety method is

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,040
perfect species with a few sets

92
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,820
of Justice are only distributed in a

93
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,380
small number of reachable or perfect

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,780
species which means that the standard

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,720
based transforming Master is only used

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
useful in a small number of perfect

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,940
species

98
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,000
so in address probably we are faced with

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,440
the college degree that exciting message

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,120
don't work in the cellist perfect

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
species

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,320
in general there still lacks uh lacks a

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,020
systematic method for a comprehensive

104
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,320
Global active ip6 or transforming

105
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,699
two thousand problems with c and the

107
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,020
active ip6 adjust discover system uh

108
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,139
called a draft manner data device active

109
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,520
address popping into three sub tasks uh

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,240
at uh active ip6 address popping for a

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
regions with no such regions always

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,460
feels as under regions with certain

113
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,620
stocks

114
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,319
the fix use the high level overview of

115
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,660
address manner

116
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,199
it connects a collects the stats to make

117
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,100
aqueous six release from public sources

118
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,160
and divide a direction into different

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,460
announced perfect species

120
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,900
yeah it's a classifies this non-stop

121
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,759
perfect

122
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,940
species into different uh scenarios

123
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,919
based on the number of stats each

124
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,620
perfect space contains

125
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,460
the policy the policy in 18 use

126
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,740
different policies for active address

127
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,400
popping according to different scenarios

128
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
after a limited limiting the last

129
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,580
perfect the the the last active

130
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,460
addresses are the global active ip6 or

131
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,380
Justice and added to the ip6 list

132
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,699
well a Non-Stop perfects with no sets

133
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,300
with present adjustment and that user

active artistic addresses

137
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,840
the character is based on the

138
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,259
observation that address pattern can do

139
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,840
have similarities across Network

140
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,180
configurations

141
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,300
uh it obtains the common pattern by

142
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,840
meaningless structure features of active

143
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,620
addresses connected in other regions uh

144
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,039
and then merits two regions without such

145
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,500
to generate targets for scanning

146
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,500
adjustment consists of three call steps

147
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,240

Association strategy

150
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,760
oh that man and constructs and directed

151
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,459
graph to describe our similarity between

152
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,440
address patterns

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
uh the notes of undirected undirected

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,220
graph represents the address pattern

155
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,860
uh the 80s the passenger the similarity

156
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,459
of different patterns the relates to

157
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,560
pass into the degree of similarity

158
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,819
between different patterns

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,880
similarity to calculate the simulated

160
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,380

161
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,920
foreign

162
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,260
will produce many communities

163
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,620
uh these nuts have high similarity in

164
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,360
the same Community but low similarity in

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,839
community in different communities

166
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,440
after getting your community we move to

167
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,800
the patterns of the North or North

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,500
continual Community to

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,779
extract the common pattern above the

170
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,339
community

171
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,279
to make a pattern continue more sets

172
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,660
will adopt the unit method to get a

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,260
pattern the red figure shows the merging

174
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,240

175
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,060
we observe that the address

176
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,339
configuration patterns are more familiar

177
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,459
with the same network organization than

178
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,399
within different organizations

179
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
adjustment interacts the most similar

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,580
patterns from a library based on

181
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,700
organization Association strategy to

183
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,100
The Fakes use the methods of

184
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,260
filtering the patent Library using

185
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,300
organization levels

186
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,720
we first constructs organization levels

187
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,380
for a Non-Stop Perfect Tool visual

188

pattern in a patent Library belong to

189
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,220
uh we got the organization levels level

190
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,220
by querying the voice information

191
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,480
next

192
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,899
we get organization levels our announced

193
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,560
targeted perfect faxes uh in the same

194
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,339
way Z where it's like the most similar

195
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,399
pattern by calculating the similarity

196
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,160
between the organization level of the

197
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,980

Library

200
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:42,420
we use them to generate the target

201
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,519
addresses under Target perfect family we

202
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,540
we provide this addresses are active or

203
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,719

210
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,260
for a Non-Stop prefixes with a few sets

211
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,079
uh addressed manner I have used the

212
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,860
similarity medicine strategy to select

213
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,459

addresses further

215
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
uh similarity matches a strategy mainly

216
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,579
convince these stats to fill out more

217

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,620
matching strategy

221
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,100
we first uh opting your patterns of

field sets under attacking the prefix

223
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,240
Z which we give us a pattern library and

224
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,940
calculate the stability between the

225
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,519

229
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,839
candidate patents may use them to

230
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,300
generate Target addresses and attack the

perfects

232
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,279
uh compared to Aesthetic Solutions a

233
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,260
draft manner have is 70 percent to

234
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,320
150 percent more efficient at detecting

active active Justice

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,860
we know the higher the density of our

active addresses or the height of the

241
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,220
periods of NPO addresses we assume that

242
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,200
the density of such is a positively

243
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,600
correlates with the density of real

active artistic suggestions

245
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,420
however uh sending pairs you know stats

246
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,660

the same pimps reduce the property

250
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,160

251
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,339
management as to eliminate simple paths

252
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,180
we first use the density speed trade to

253
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,880
discover high density regions in long

254

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,220
uh high density regions

264
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,940
update the active address density

density regions of active addresses in

272
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,000
the real network will be discovered

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,980
it can use the difference in
