1
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,720
it's really great to be here at usenix

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
uh to be honest it's great to be

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,039
anywhere after a couple years

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,119
having said that usenix is really

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
particularly special to me

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
going back to my undergraduate days

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,439
and one of the first very first use mix

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
meetings was in toronto now i have to

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
tell you that we definitely did not stay

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,440
at a resort

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
in fact the people that came from out of

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,239
town

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
brought their sleeping bags and stayed

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
on the floors of graduate student

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,520
departments

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
so we've come a long way

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,480
now we'll see if the clicker works yes

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
so i have to start with uh i'm

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
networking guys so i'll start with some

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,079
knacks and some acts

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
uh the knacks or disclaimers are simply

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
to say that uh some of these slides have

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,680
a vmware copyright logo on them vmware

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
was actually

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
kind enough that when i wrapped up my

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
time at vmware they let me take some uh

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,479
however you know anything i say here

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,240
isn't representing vmware it's just

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
representing my own thinking uh

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
similarly i'm uh working uh sort of a

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
day or two a week

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
with the national science foundation

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,320
helping them start up their new tip

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
directorate which is kind of really

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
exciting you should go learn about it

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
however again anything i say here is

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
really just me as an independent

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,600
researcher

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
a free agent and not representing the

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,400
views of nsf so you know don't go making

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,560
proposals uh based on anything i say

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,799
here

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
in the act department

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
uh you know i've just as marcos

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
indicated i've really had the privilege

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
of being in a lot of great places and

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
it's really not about the places it's

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
about the people so i just really want

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
to kind of acknowledge that a you know

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
tremendous number of people

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
have helped me along the way have

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,759
mentored me provided advice guidance

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
i've learned from them you know

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
especially from graduate students

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
interns etc

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
and through darpa one of the best things

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,160
about that was the ability to get

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
connected to an enormous number of other

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,760
universities

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
and researchers at those universities so

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
you know if i really put the full logo

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,680
list of people that i feel like i've you

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
know benefited from or that have

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
indirectly had input into this talk it

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
would be really large

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
i'd also like to explicitly acknowledge

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
that there's some folks

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,760
that

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
actually you know sort of sat through

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
variations in this talk and they know

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
who they are i don't want to implicate

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
them

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
but i really appreciate the input that

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
they provided

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
okay uh instead of closing words of

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
advice just in case i'm running late uh

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
i thought i'd provide some opening words

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
of advice

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
and it's particularly relevant uh at

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
this time of year when there's lots of

81
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
interns active i'm assuming we have a

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,319
lot of interns here

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
in the crowd and i know there's a lot of

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
uh graduate students and interns or

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,159
co-authors and many or primary authors

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
on many of the papers so bob taylor is

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
like you know the really great leader of

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
systems research labs

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
uh historically and he the advice he

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
gave me many years ago

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
was be kind to interns

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
because someday

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,959
they may keep you around

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
clicker is not functioning so i'll go

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
back to the

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
if only as a mascot

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,599
so

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
with that in mind i'm going to share

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
sort of

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
some ideas and this talk is really in

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
that sense aimed at the grad students

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
and the interns

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
and share some ideas that have you know

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,879
are

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
things that have either been bugging me

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,920
for a while or things that i really wish

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
somebody would go take care of

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
challenges for people to take on

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,159
one of those uh is in this you know kind

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
of security research space we've kind of

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
almost evolved a business model of

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
security research right researcher comes

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
up with a new exploit

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
and identifies an exploit path they find

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
a way to patch the exploit they go start

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
a startup the vcs invest they're really

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
happy

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
somebody acquires them so there's a nice

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,240
exit for the vc and the researchers

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
and then basically rinse and repeat

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
but meanwhile if you're actually trying

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
to run security at a large enterprise

123
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,400
company you have to kind of buy over 100

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
products today and then try to put them

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
all together and all you've really done

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
by doing all that is patched these

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,880
exploits and you haven't actually gotten

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
yourself security so i really like sort

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
of like to call for and encourage people

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
to try to avoid the incremental work

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
if you were a viewer

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
you know please you know stop you know

133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
get letting all those uh papers that are

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
incremental through

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
uh and

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
uh try to get people think really

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
systematically about how to achieve

138
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
security i'm not saying we're gonna get

139
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
this with one grand design but i bet

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,199
that if we sort of broke this down into

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
five or six really big problems and

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
people took on those problems that we

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
could probably make a ton more progress

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
than we've made

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
uh deep learning

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
okay so i

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
like i think many of us i really love

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
the results we can achieve with deep

149
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
learning right it's really phenomenal we

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
can do things that we for many many

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
years just dreamed of trying to do

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,039
now we're not you know doing them

153
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
they're in production happening every

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
day

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
the catch is i think we've gotten too

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,680
infatuated with the results

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
to the point where we're losing our

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
curiosity about how the stuff works

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
and you know that curiosity that's the

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
soul of researchers right so i think

161
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,199
it's really important that people uh

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,600
stay focused on not just how does deep

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
learning work but what are the

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
alternatives to deep learning

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,360
it seems you know to me unlikely that

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,039
this thing that's you know consuming

167
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,280
just exponentially greater amounts of

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
resources is actually going to be the

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
long-term solution i suspect that there

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
are people already out there that have

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
the glimmer of the idea of how to do

172
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,720
things better uh and the catch is

173
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
that the billions and billions of

174
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
dollars that are being invested in

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
making deep learning go kind of further

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,479
and and faster and far farther

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,960
is uh kind of creating a lot of noise

178
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
that mask the signal

179
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
so i'd like to sort of encourage people

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
to be intentive to signals be attentive

181
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,520
to new ideas in the space new

182
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
alternatives

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,479
because it really feels like this is an

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
area where we've got to make a change

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
we're going to have to sort of make what

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
we call a left turn

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
to move forward

188
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
okay so i also really love decentralized

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
ledgers and think this is a great

190
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,120
technology uh at vmware we sort of

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
started a whole business around private

192
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
or permissioned ledgers

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,479
i think that's going to be a great

194
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
business for quite a while but in the

195
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
long term i really think you know we

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
want to have public

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
permissionless ledgers be trustworthy

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,599
and they really aren't today

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
for a variety of reasons happy to take

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
this offline

201
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
however um

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
you know the the point i i think i want

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,440
to make here is that due to the kind of

204
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
history of how bitcoin came about and

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
everything else we've actually conflated

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,840
multiple things there's the

207
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,199
decentralization thrust

208
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
there's an anonymity thrust and there's

209
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
a having your own currency thrust and

210
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,319
all these kind of got bound together and

211
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,840
i'd really like to encourage some folks

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
to think about how could we refactor

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
this to sort of tease those things apart

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
they don't inherently need to be bound

215
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,880
together

216
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
and i believe that if we could tease

217
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
them apart we could actually move

218
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,360
towards much more trustworthy public

219
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,199
ledgers and that would be a great

220
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,960
infrastructure for folks to build on in

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
the future

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
okay finally

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
there's a collection of stuff

224
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,440
that is now more than 50 years old

225
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
that is actually you know kind of the

226
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
cornerstone and foundation of a

227
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,720
tremendous amount of what we in the

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
systems community are doing

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
and you know i really think it's time we

230
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
moved on like just think about what what

231
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,560
did computers look like 50 years ago

232
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
and many of you won't have seen them

233
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
would have to go to the computer history

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
museum to get a sense of you know what

235
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
they look like what their capabilities

236
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,400
were

237
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
and it doesn't really make sense that

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
we're still basing much of what we do on

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
these 50 year old artifacts so just to

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
call some things out and i know this is

241
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
used next and not going to be popular

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
right unix

243
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
right goes back to my undergraduate days

244
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
uh seems like it's time we moved on

245
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
there must be kind of a new approach and

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
it's really time that somebody uh

247
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,839
propagated that

248
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,000
um declarative methods are something i

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
really really love used heavily in the

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
database space however our main

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
mechanism for that today is the sql

252
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
query language

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
again kind of 50 years old

254
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
what's amazing is sql is getting even

255
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
more popular today largely i'd argue

256
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
because nobody's come up with a good

257
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
alternative so i'd really like to

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
encourage people to come up with a great

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
new query language and new ways to use

260
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
uh

261
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,839
declarative methods

262
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
and then most this keynote is actually

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,800
going to be about

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
networking and in particular packet

265
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
networking

266
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
again over 50 years old right there was

267
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
a time where we were the rebels

268
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
upsetting the the apple cart of you know

269
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
the the telephony people and the circuit

270
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
switch folks

271
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
uh i really want somebody to come and

272
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
upset our apple cart so

273
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,080
rebels want it in these spaces

274
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
okay so as i said the talk really is

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
meant to be about networking so the real

276
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
keynote starts starts now i just thank

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
you for giving me the time to just get

278
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,399
some of that stuff off my chest

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
and one of the things that you've been

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
thinking about in framing this

281
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,800
is the big sweep of time in networking

282
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
in effect we've had sort of three major

283
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
global infrastructures

284
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
telegraphy

285
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
circuit switched telephony

286
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
and packed switched internet and you

287
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
know operating on sort of you know

288
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
basically different different structures

289
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
different technologies completely

290
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
it's pretty impressive how long lived

291
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
these things are right they sort of are

292
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
uh over

293
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
a century each like if you look at

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
telegraphy

295
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
uh sort of over a century that these

296
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
systems lasted

297
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
we think of ourselves as innovating

298
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
quickly but the core architecture tends

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
to last a long time

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,600
although we insert what i think of as

301
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,519
midlife kickers you know we keep

302
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
increasing and improving

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
a lot of what goes on under the covers

304
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
in those networks uh over time so

305
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
there's a lot of innovation that's kind

306
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
of hidden by this sweep

307
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
so if you look at telegraphy and

308
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,240
actually there was a system in france

309
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
called heliography that predated it that

310
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
was optically based

311
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
but if we look at electronic telegraphy

312
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
it was a storm forward network

313
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
so right there that tells you that

314
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
storage was used in the network

315
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
and one of the interesting midlife

316
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
kickers here was when people realized

317
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,720
that

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
initially you know you had a human being

319
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,680
using a you know morse code that using a

320
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
key

321
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
to tap out morse code

322
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
signal went over this really valuable

323
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
wire that was interconnecting the cities

324
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,880
and a human was listening at the other

325
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
end

326
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
and they realized they weren't using

327
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
that wire very efficiently right they it

328
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
was wire was restricted to running at

329
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
the end to end human speed

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,839
so what they they did

331
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
is you know mechanically

332
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
created paper tape systems so you could

333
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
have a whole bunch of humans that were

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
essentially you know morse code keying

335
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
messages they got recorded on paper tape

336
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
and then those paper tape messages could

337
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
be squirted down the wire at high speed

338
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
so in effect you had kind of a form of

339
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
time division multiplexing happening

340
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
over that wire

341
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
they actually also use frequency

342
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
division multiplexing so the paper tape

343
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
was a storage mechanism and you also saw

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,839
people effectively using information

345
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
theory to multiplex more signals onto

346
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
this this is where the term bod came

347
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
from

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
if we move forward to circuit switching

349
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,959
which was another sort of end to end in

350
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
this case it was you know a human one

351
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,320
end of a telephone human at the other

352
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
end of the telephone

353
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
call

354
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
this really got going with the invention

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
of the stroger switch which was a sort

356
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,959
of

357
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,040
step-by-step uh

358
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,399
electromechanical switch

359
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
that enabled the switching of the calls

360
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
over time we introduced new technology

361
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,839
into that

362
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
uh and some of the important things is

363
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,079
we added software uh

364
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,240
effectively it was we didn't change the

365
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
switch but you had software control over

366
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,000
the switches

367
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
uh so you um now we're introducing

368
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
computation into the network or

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
non-human computation into the network

370
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
machine based computation

371
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
um

372
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
and

373
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
we actually later

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
uh interestingly enough moved from

375
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,399
having that computation being in-band to

376
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,200
being out-of-band signaling with ss7 the

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
reason i mentioned that is we did a

378
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
similar thing with the internet when we

379
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
moved to sdn you can think of that as a

380
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
switch from in-band

381
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
signaling to out-of-band signaling

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,440
the uh other thing that is interesting

383
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
in terms of the digi you know adding

384
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
digital technology into the circuit

385
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
switch network into the telephony

386
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,600
network

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
is we started adding storage

388
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
and we used information tech information

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
theory

390
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
the information theory told us that we

391
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
could sample the analog call and create

392
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
digital samples

393
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
and then we'd store them in oh my god

394
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
they were going to have a one byte

395
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
buffer one byte

396
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,959
at the front of each port going into

397
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,560
each switch

398
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,079
for every subscriber line so if you

399
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,760
added this all up you might think there

400
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,480
might have been a gigabyte of storage

401
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
being put into all of the united states

402
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
and at the time the decision to do that

403
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,079
seemed immense that seemed like wow a

404
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
gigabyte of storage across the whole

405
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
country that was going to be amazingly

406
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
expensive

407
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
but they did effectively put that

408
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
storage into the network and that

409
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
storage meant that

410
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
much like what had happened with

411
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,839
telegraphy you could now take many many

412
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,480
calls and send them down the same wire

413
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
but notice that end to end things had to

414
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,319
operate at the same speed

415
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
now when we move to packet switching

416
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
uh and you know which is the kind of

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,959
core technology underlying the internet

418
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,279
we really went heavy on adding compute

419
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
into the network right because now we

420
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
were doing instead of doing a

421
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
computation to set up each phone call

422
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
we're basically doing a computation on

423
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,839
every packet at every step along the way

424
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,519
right so huge amount of computation in

425
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,040
the network that's i think largely

426
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
realized

427
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
we also

428
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
added a huge amount of storage

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,760
right we started having packet buffers

430
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
at the front of those switch ports so

431
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
they could sort of absorb the bursts

432
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
absorb the packets coming in

433
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,240
from the endpoints

434
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,959
we

435
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,120
using these kind of two things we now

436
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
had a technology that for one thing it

437
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
still worked end to end

438
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
but instead of being limited to one type

439
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
of traffic like telegraphy or telephony

440
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,639
it could carry almost any application

441
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
that we could digitize so that was

442
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
pretty cool that was a big big step

443
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
forward

444
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
and as i said we were heavily using

445
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
storage we could get statistical

446
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,360
multiplexing so we could now instead of

447
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
doing sort of uh

448
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
time division multiplexing we could

449
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
statistically multiplex many calls onto

450
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,720
the wires we were getting or many flows

451
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
onto the wires getting way better

452
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
performance and efficiency out of those

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
you know expensive long distance lengths

454
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
there's another value that the storage

455
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,600
had that i think isn't fully appreciated

456
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
which the storage facilitated rate

457
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
adaption it actually meant that you know

458
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
something connected to the internet

459
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
that's a low-speed device operating at

460
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
megabits or maybe even as low as

461
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
kilobits

462
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
can send messages to a server in a data

463
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
center that's connected at you know

464
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,079
gigabits speeds and these two things can

465
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
interoperate so not only can we carry a

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
range of applications we have rate

467
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
adaption and the ability to interoperate

468
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
at different speeds all this enabled by

469
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
storage

470
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,120
so

471
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,639
you know you're seeing a refrain here

472
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
right more computation in the network

473
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
and these are on hundred-year timelines

474
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,519
right more storage in the network

475
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,399
and

476
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
we actually also added a lot more

477
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
information theory into the network

478
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,759
because while the internet and packet

479
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
switching were happening cellular folks

480
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,519
were busy innovating you know

481
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
particularly in the wireless part of the

482
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
network

483
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
at the last mile

484
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,079
and in fact it wasn't just the seller

485
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
folks the fiber to the home folks and

486
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,919
hybrid fiber coax folks

487
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,359
also on the wired side and what they

488
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
were figuring out is how to get a lot

489
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,799
more bits per hertz into the channel

490
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,199
using information theory however the use

491
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
of information theory was really

492
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
constrained it was basically down at the

493
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
physical layer and kind of

494
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
geographically out in the last mile or

495
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,720
last kilometer

496
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
okay but again you you have this pattern

497
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,199
of taking advantage of information

498
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
theory

499
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
so what i'm basically saying is the

500
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,080
long-standing tools of the networking

501
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
trade

502
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,799
computation in the network i'm kind of

503
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,840
growing that out because i think

504
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
everybody here gets that

505
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,679
but i want to emphasize that storage in

506
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,120
the network

507
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,039
and use of information theory are also

508
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
really important so as we start thinking

509
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
about like okay what happens in the

510
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
future we should keep those things in

511
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
mind

512
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,320
we move to

513
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
actually a world in which we're not

514
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
doing end-to-end computing

515
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
networking i would argue it's pretty

516
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
much all edge to cloud networking

517
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
and that's what's really happening right

518
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
the vast bulk of the communication is

519
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
edge to cloud

520
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
and these operators

521
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,760
of the hyperscalers realized that they

522
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
could actually design their own networks

523
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
inside their data centers i mean they

524
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
had the scale to do their own thing

525
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,600
so they could deviate from the internet

526
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,039
standard where appropriate and where it

527
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,880
helped them and then they could actually

528
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
take control of the networks and you

529
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
know get their own fibers

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
interconnecting their data centers and

531
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,679
then in order to provide kind of better

532
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,080
service to their users they could push

533
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
their networks out extend their fiber

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
networks and their networking technology

535
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
out till it came very close to the

536
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
access networks of that last small or

537
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
last kilometer

538
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
so that creates an interesting you know

539
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,559
situation

540
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,440
where

541
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
we like to think of the internet as this

542
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
globally connected network with these

543
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,600
sort of cada style diagrams where

544
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
everybody's doing the same thing

545
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
everywhere

546
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
but the reality is increasingly

547
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
the you know kind of tca pip is really

548
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,679
just a kind of like a connector a way

549
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
you plug things together at key points

550
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
and you know within the access networks

551
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
they could do whatever they want

552
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
and within the hyperscalers they can do

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
whatever they want so there's kind of

554
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,720
this gap

555
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
between the way people perceive the

556
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,640
network

557
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
as this you know everybody doing the

558
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
same thing globally interconnected and

559
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
the reality of what's happening with the

560
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,200
traffic and so kind of one of my

561
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,080
uh

562
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
themes today that i'll come back to

563
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
later is that it may be time for some

564
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
sort of repartitioning of concerns here

565
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,799
uh so we you know kind of think through

566
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
uh that the 3gpp crowd uh they're the

567
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
ones that do you know the standards for

568
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
3g 4g 5g if you take a look at their

569
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
stuff they think they're designing a

570
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
full intent environment and quad stuff

571
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
and everything else the reality is what

572
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
they're really great at is doing that

573
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,679
you know

574
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,960
wireless part uh in that last kilometer

575
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
that's really their strength but they're

576
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
sort of designing in a mindset where

577
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
they think they're doing the whole thing

578
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,480
the sitcom and internet society and you

579
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
know community i come from and really

580
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,480
love we think we're designing the whole

581
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
thing

582
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
and there's the hyperscalers that are

583
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,160
actually carrying most of the traffic

584
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,640
most of the way

585
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
okay so that's a bit of a spoiler alert

586
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,240
that i'm going to come back to this and

587
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
say that i think the really kind of

588
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
interesting opportunity that i want to

589
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,440
try to encourage through this talk

590
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,880
people to look at

591
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
is you know computing and networking

592
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,720
near the edge at this place where the

593
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
hyperscalers meet the access providers

594
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,919
because that seems to be a place where

595
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,840
there's a disconnect and that those

596
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
disconnects represent opportunities to

597
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
change things

598
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
okay so as we think about what's likely

599
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
to be next

600
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
it's always good to think about you know

601
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
what are the design constraints

602
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
and i think you know there are many

603
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
design constraints for global network

604
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
infrastructure that are sort of

605
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
evergreen right they're just not going

606
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,240
to go away i've listed them out here i'm

607
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
not going to talk about them today

608
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,400
i want to talk about the other questions

609
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
we should ask ourselves we shouldn't

610
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,600
just get caught up in thinking about the

611
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
constraints because we'll likely end up

612
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
with the same thing that we have today

613
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
if we want to think about the future one

614
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,600
good thing to do

615
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
is to think about what's going to be in

616
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
surplus what's going to be unconstrained

617
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
because that's going to give you kind of

618
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
a new currency and a new ability you

619
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
know how you use that currency and how

620
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
you respond to that change

621
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
is kind of this new ability to you know

622
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
do things differently in the future

623
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,559
maybe different ways to address the

624
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
design constraints

625
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,120
so i think a couple things that are

626
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
going to be in surplus going forward

627
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,880
one is edge capacity

628
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,679
so um you know if you look at 5g the

629
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
promise is gigabits everybody's phone's

630
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
going to you know operate at gigabit

631
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,559
speeds

632
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,080
they're not really going to get there

633
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
right i mean i think

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
they'll get to tens of megabits maybe

635
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
100 megabit with 5g however you know

636
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
they're setting the same kind of goals

637
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,799
for 6g so as we think things forward for

638
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,400
the next decade i think we are going to

639
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,280
have a tremendous amount increase in the

640
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
capacity that edge users can

641
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
feed into the network

642
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
to me this is kind of like a transition

643
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
that we went through many many years ago

644
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
you know we had initially 10 megabit

645
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
ethernet at the desktop

646
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
people were starting to hit the limit of

647
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
what that could do

648
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,240
and then we dropped hundred megabit

649
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
ethernet on them at the desktop and

650
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
pretty much nobody could really take

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
full advantage of it and by the time

652
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,520
people started hitting the edge 100

653
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,080
megabit everybody already had gigabit

654
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
right i think we're seeing that same

655
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,200
transition from shortage to surplus

656
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
likely to happen

657
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
about a decade from now which is the

658
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
time span at which we all want to do

659
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,960
research

660
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
for reasons i'm not going to go into the

661
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
details of i also think we're going to

662
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
have a huge surplus of high resolution

663
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,039
sensors

664
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,320
that are going to be really cheap and

665
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
really available you know the factories

666
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
are turning out billions of very high

667
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
resolution cameras

668
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,159
uh to go on cell phones today uh you

669
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
know they're going to keep turning out

670
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
lots of sensors and they're going to

671
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,559
have to go to other places in the future

672
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,240
so there's going to be lots of

673
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,960
opportunity to cost effectively

674
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,799
instrument the physical world around us

675
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
at very high fidelity and bring that

676
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,440
information into the network

677
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,320
so

678
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,240
with that change you know how will the

679
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
applications be different i think

680
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
we're going to finally see the era of

681
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
ubiquitous computing that mark wiser had

682
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
envisaged

683
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
now mark actually talked about that in

684
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,679
the context of calm technology and this

685
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,120
notion that the computing you know would

686
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
melt into the background and would

687
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
really be essentially in the background

688
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
doing everything lots of things for us

689
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
without us having to ask right and

690
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
without the computer constantly

691
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,400
interrupting us etc things would just

692
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,679
happen

693
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,960
so

694
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
i think of that as

695
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,799
uh requiring proactive computing

696
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,480
and a transition to sort of an

697
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
environment in which our applications

698
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
and particularly these edge to cloud

699
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,679
systems

700
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,280
right are going to bring the physical

701
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
and virtual worlds together because

702
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
we're going to have that really great

703
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
instrumentation of the physical world

704
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
around us

705
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,640
we're going to bring that together with

706
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
the information that we already have in

707
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
our virtual world

708
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
and we're going to use it to

709
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
automatically and proactively anticipate

710
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
our needs and start taking actions on

711
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
our behalf that's the proactive part of

712
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,559
this

713
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,640
i've got some examples here but my point

714
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
here is it's a different paradigm

715
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
so you know we've we still think

716
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
architecturally that we've got an ntn

717
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,279
network in practice we're using it for

718
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,840
edge to cloud and i think going forward

719
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
we're going to be using it for proactive

720
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
edged cloud and we want to think about

721
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
what we need to do differently

722
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,679
so

723
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,440
i think the way we'll do that is take

724
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
advantage of the tools of our trade

725
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
right so there'll be more computation

726
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
than the network again that's i think

727
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,320
pretty obvious i'm not going to go into

728
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,919
detail on that

729
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,120
i think we're going to have to figure

730
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
out how to take much way more advantage

731
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
of storage in the network than we do

732
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
today

733
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
i've put this chart up here because you

734
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
know dave charlton did some early work

735
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,559
and content routing

736
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,120
i never heard dave say it's the content

737
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
stupid but for those of you that know

738
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
dave charton it's the kind of thing he

739
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,360
would have said

740
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,799
so i figured i'd put it up there and

741
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
attribute it

742
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
however there's been a ton of work since

743
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
that time in this space to be honest it

744
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,960
hasn't really broken through into the

745
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,039
mainstream this is you know

746
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,200
content-centric networking

747
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
it goes under a lot of different names

748
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,760
scott schenker wrote a paper with some

749
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,279
colleagues seeing the forest for the

750
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,799
trees that i think calls out some of the

751
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
reasons it hasn't broken through

752
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
but i think now is the time to revisit

753
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,080
that i have some ideas there happy to

754
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
talk to people offline i think there's a

755
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
real chance to push this through

756
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,240
and dramatically increase how we use

757
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
storage

758
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,679
and when i say in the network what i

759
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,720
mean is

760
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
right between the

761
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
between the users of the information

762
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
right to users don't think separately

763
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
about the network the cloud etc they

764
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
just think it's all the cloud

765
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,279
and it's you know all going to happen

766
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,360
for me

767
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,159
so

768
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,840
the other tool of our trades information

769
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,880
theory

770
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,720
and so the key question is how can we

771
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
use information theory to move into this

772
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,080
future

773
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,799
and my answer there is

774
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,520
surprise

775
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,039
okay what i mean by that uh

776
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,919
is actually surprising

777
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
so there's kind of this core tenant of

778
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
information theory and that

779
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,400
says that the basic idea here

780
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
is that the value of a message depends

781
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
on the degree to which the content of

782
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
the message is surprising

783
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,200
okay so you know if i send you a book

784
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
you've already read

785
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
no information value

786
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
no matter what price i may charge for

787
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,039
that book there's no information value

788
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
if i actually send you the result of a

789
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
coin flip whether that was heads or

790
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
tails and you had no you know it's a new

791
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,440
honest new coin flip uh you had no way

792
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
of knowing what it would be that is high

793
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
information value

794
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,559
so it's kind of bothered me for quite a

795
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,840
while that this

796
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
this seems to turn a few things you know

797
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,279
upside down

798
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,360
uh for example today we think delivering

799
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,880
movies over the internet has high value

800
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
from a that may be true from an

801
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,159
intellectual property perspective but

802
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,679
from an information theory perspective

803
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,600
you know there's not all that movies

804
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,159
ever been made uh they're all pre-known

805
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,400
pretty much very you know very low rate

806
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,120
at which new movies are created actually

807
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
so it really sort of i think turns on

808
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,480
around some of your thoughts about

809
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
what's valuable what are we delivering

810
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
what makes a difference

811
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
so a simplistic interpretation of this

812
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,799
would be that all the old content you

813
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,480
know all that stuff that google's you

814
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
know sort of organized all the world's

815
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,000
information

816
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,080
all that's got no value

817
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
well that that really can't be quite

818
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
right okay

819
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,600
so i think the more realistic uh

820
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
interpretation here is that the way

821
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,039
we're going to create value in the

822
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,720
future through networks and our

823
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
computation infrastructure

824
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,279
is by fusing old information that's

825
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,960
previously known

826
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,720
with new information and that new

827
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
information is going to be coming from

828
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,880
the edge of the network right and so

829
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,679
what we wanted to be do is be thoughtful

830
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,240
about how and where we combine old

831
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
content uh with new

832
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
and with respect to the old content we

833
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
can be super aggressive

834
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
right it's off there in the cloud land

835
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,440
of doing a ton of opportunistic and

836
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
speculative computing to kind of

837
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
pre-compute answers to all sorts of

838
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
questions you might need

839
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,799
and using storage

840
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,520
stage the answers close to where the

841
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
users are

842
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,120
and i think that's a huge opportunity we

843
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
do a lot of this today but i think this

844
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,799
is the place we could really

845
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,919
systematically take it on

846
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
um i want to thank scott schenker for

847
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
for suggesting i use the term semantic

848
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
surprise

849
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
to basically say that

850
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
we really need to sort of hoist this

851
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
notion of surprisal and information

852
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
theory that we currently use kind of

853
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
just in the corner of the network

854
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,159
largely speaking it's mostly the

855
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
physical layer and out by the edge we

856
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,559
use it a little for compression

857
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
but hoist that up to the application

858
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
layer and really start thinking about

859
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
okay what does surprise mean for this

860
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
application and how would that change

861
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
how i how i design it and think about it

862
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,399
and deliver it

863
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,279
now

864
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,799
that doesn't mean we should do this

865
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,360
independently for each of billions of

866
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,679
applications in practice at any point in

867
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,240
time there's actually only a small

868
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,200
number

869
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,279
of different classes of application or

870
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
classes of traffic that dominate the

871
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,960
traffic in the network

872
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
so if we really just you know figured

873
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
out okay go through the pareto analysis

874
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
let's get the top number of application

875
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
classes of traffic

876
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
and analyze those think those through

877
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
for surprisal and build the

878
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
infrastructure for those and then as new

879
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,399
traffic types kind of rise in the pareto

880
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,239
we can take those on and address those

881
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,120
okay so it surprises the approach

882
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,559
there's a question of where in the

883
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,080
network is this going to have the most

884
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,159
impact where should we leverage it

885
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,120
and

886
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
my answer

887
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,520
there

888
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,279
i've kind of thought about it quite a

889
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,080
bit

890
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
and

891
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,200
you know i looked at the edge and i have

892
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,799
to say that i've you know i think

893
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,200
there's some kind of controversy here uh

894
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,559
there's a lot of people heavily

895
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,399
promoting edge computing doing a lot

896
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,279
more at the edge

897
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,559
you know personally i'm in a little

898
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,000
skeptical about it it feels like

899
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
something that's heavily promoted by the

900
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,760
network operators uh saying oh you've

901
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,520
got to do this because we're the only

902
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,039
you know it's the only place you can put

903
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
it is sort of buy our you know base

904
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,000
stations or buy the antennas uh so you

905
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
must do it there

906
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
it feels like it's also being promoted

907
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
by people that used to sell servers

908
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
into the data centers of enterprises but

909
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,399
now as enterprises move that stuff into

910
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,520
the cloud

911
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,440
you know they need a new market so oh

912
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
edge is going to be a really big market

913
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
so you know i've been a little you know

914
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
sort of cautious about how's that going

915
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
to develop

916
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
but edge has some benefits right at the

917
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,480
edge we've got low latency

918
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,799
the catch is that we have limited power

919
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,240
and limited ability to share the

920
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,760
resources right you pretty much have to

921
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,399
dedicate the resources to the user uh

922
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,320
individual user at the edge and that's

923
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,080
not always the most efficient thing to

924
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,880
do

925
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,240
now on the other hand if you do things

926
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,000
deep in the cloud you've got tremendous

927
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
ability to share resources but you have

928
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
high latency

929
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,279
so

930
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,880
i think we want to be is in this

931
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,440
goldilocks zone near the edge

932
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,679
right and that seems like a kind of

933
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,039
amorphous thing so i'm going to try to

934
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:43,840
put

935
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
a more specific definition on it

936
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,399
i'm going to sort of argue that near the

937
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,760
edge

938
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
should mean that if you drew bubbles

939
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
that were about a millisecond speed of

940
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
light delay right propagation delay

941
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
you want to sort of essentially put your

942
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,440
near the edge computation within those

943
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
bubbles

944
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
relative to the sensors actuators and

945
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,080
people that are going to use that

946
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,440
information

947
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
so you want to basically be able to take

948
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,640
advantage of surprise and fusing new and

949
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,960
old information within that bubble

950
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
relative to individual users and those

951
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,200
are big bubbles okay

952
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960
you know light goes a long distance in a

953
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,640
millisecond

954
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
now

955
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,480
the 5g and 6g folks particularly 60

956
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,919
folks are actually trying to get down

957
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,919
into the microsecond range why am i

958
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,159
focused on milliseconds

959
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,519
i think the the reason is that

960
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,880
if you think about what's going to be

961
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
good for human beings we would like to

962
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,480
improve the latency as experienced by

963
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,720
humans

964
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,559
we don't really do anything faster our

965
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,799
visual system runs at about 13

966
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,559
milliseconds

967
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
our conscious response is way slower

968
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,120
right over 100

969
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,799
and so if you think okay i want to get

970
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,039
this down even within 13 milliseconds i

971
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,799
got a millisecond one way two

972
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,440
milliseconds round trip you know 5x

973
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
overhead whatever it feels like

974
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,159
that millisecond bubble ought to be

975
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,240
sufficient to get about a 10 millisecond

976
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
latency and that's what i'd really like

977
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,720
to encourage is that we take advantage

978
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,200
of surprise in a way that allows us to

979
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,240
deliver

980
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,880
low latency latency that's basically as

981
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
good as humans can need

982
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,799
uh but does it in in you know this

983
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,480
realistic this 10 millisecond only as

984
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
good as humans need don't try to do

985
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
better than that

986
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,799
uh and do it with the best efforts

987
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,240
paradigm

988
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
and don't even think about you know the

989
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,880
again the uh people looking at 5t and

990
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,399
now at 6t

991
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,120
we're trying to design ultra reliable

992
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,320
ultra low latency communication

993
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
and you know i have a feeling that you

994
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,080
that this can't actually be done i'd

995
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,760
love for somebody to go prove a cap

996
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,279
theorem that says you can't have those

997
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,519
both at the same time

998
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,279
even if it could be done i don't think

999
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,120
real engineers would use it in some of

1000
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,559
the ways that are being suggested right

1001
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,320
the reasons to go from milliseconds to

1002
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,279
microseconds for it's basically

1003
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,799
if it's not humans consuming the

1004
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,559
information but machines and people are

1005
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,760
imagining that people are going to do

1006
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,000
things like telesurgery and they're

1007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
going to have autonomous vehicles and

1008
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,480
they're going to have automated

1009
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
factories all of which are going to fail

1010
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,320
catastrophically

1011
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,918
if you don't deliver the information

1012
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,399
within microseconds but that also means

1013
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,839
they're going to fail catastrophically

1014
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,440
if the network's not working if a truck

1015
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,359
hits the base station anything like that

1016
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,119
so i don't think there's any way real

1017
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,040
engineers are going to do that

1018
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,399
i think what we should do is you know

1019
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,839
instead of sort of

1020
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
trying to gold plate the network to

1021
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,719
operate at microsecond scale latencies

1022
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,800
could we do just a really really good

1023
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
job of best effort millisecond because

1024
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
that would really move the world forward

1025
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,679
so i want to kind of encourage that

1026
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,719
focus

1027
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,239
now here's some examples of how that

1028
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,480
could be used the xcom people have been

1029
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
working on ar vr

1030
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,239
and there's a key issue there because

1031
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,399
you really do want to get the response

1032
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,719
down within those human parameters

1033
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,560
otherwise people notice the disconnect

1034
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
between what they're seeing what they

1035
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,119
should see they get

1036
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
i in particular react and get headaches

1037
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,920
uh under those circumstances

1038
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,839
so that would argue for putting kind of

1039
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,520
all the rendering right on the goggles

1040
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,599
the catch is you know that's power it's

1041
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
expensive it's power hungry

1042
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,880
uh it adds weight so what they're doing

1043
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
is essentially split rendering

1044
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
where you put some of the rendering near

1045
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,480
the goggles so that you can always show

1046
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
the human something that's approximately

1047
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,520
right

1048
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,040
and then you put the more detailed

1049
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,520
higher resolution better rendering

1050
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
sort of a little bit deeper into the

1051
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
network now right now they're putting it

1052
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,040
only a little distance into the network

1053
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,960
but i've spoken with them and i think

1054
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,480
they feel like yeah you know that

1055
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
millisecond bubble would be good enough

1056
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
and the neat thing is the deeper you put

1057
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
into the network the more sharing of

1058
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,480
those computational storage resources

1059
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,160
you can get and a better job you can do

1060
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
so

1061
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
near the edge seems to be a really good

1062
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
place

1063
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,839
for us to adopt this kind of approach

1064
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
where we synthesize what you know butler

1065
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,000
lampson's called predictions

1066
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,240
right you have sort of low latency local

1067
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,079
predictions that you can produce really

1068
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,280
cheaply

1069
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
and you combine them with high fidelity

1070
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,720
kind of global predictions that you need

1071
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
help from the network

1072
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,800
to do and this this prediction system

1073
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,160
notices you know that's kind of a

1074
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
generic approach you could be using

1075
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,119
machine learning models you could be

1076
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,119
using physics based models there's a

1077
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,280
bunch of approaches that we could use

1078
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,000
uh the folks uh yates and and colleagues

1079
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,839
at rutgers are actually starting a new

1080
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,240
project uh in which they're planning to

1081
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,800
use uh what they refer to as age of

1082
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,960
information analysis

1083
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,599
to help this this kind of process where

1084
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,359
you know essentially by knowing how old

1085
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,880
the information is you can know when

1086
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
something's too late and throw it away

1087
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
right

1088
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,839
which is kind of very important to

1089
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,000
fusing the information coming from the

1090
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,040
two levels of models

1091
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,800
okay so

1092
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
we you know can use surprise to do that

1093
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,480
fusion

1094
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,240
what you know what are sort of i just

1095
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,200
wanted to look at some of the

1096
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,160
capabilities we would need uh to put

1097
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
somewhere between the edge and the cloud

1098
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,839
and notice what i'm kind of arguing for

1099
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,240
here is not that we put capabilities

1100
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,560
everywhere but we just kind of find some

1101
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,280
places so we just have a three level

1102
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,920
rather than a you know end level uh

1103
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,839
architecture

1104
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,440
and you know what you so one thing

1105
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
you're going to want to do that we

1106
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
already effectively do is put a bunch of

1107
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
caching there right so that again the

1108
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
cloud is cranking away doing a lot of

1109
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
opportunistic computing pre-computing

1110
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,599
things you might need and packaging them

1111
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,480
up and putting them in the right places

1112
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,680
near you in the other direction you're

1113
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,280
going to want to be able to aggregate

1114
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
and filter and compress all that

1115
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
information that's coming from the edge

1116
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
it's going to have to you know you're

1117
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
probably going to want to move it to the

1118
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
cloud for long term storage and to over

1119
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,640
the long term improve

1120
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,480
right the information goes from new to

1121
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
being old once it's old you want it to

1122
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,720
be used to improve the the flow back in

1123
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
the other direction however the

1124
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
important thing here is you're also

1125
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,440
going to want to be able to have

1126
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
functionality diffuse the new and the

1127
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,359
old so these are the sorts of things

1128
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,640
you're going to want to be able to do

1129
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,200
near the edge

1130
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,160
so

1131
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,079
you know there are some if you have that

1132
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,599
kind of functionality there's some

1133
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,839
interesting things you can do right

1134
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,400
one is very smart delivery of upstream

1135
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
of the upstream content

1136
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
uh the other is you can start thinking

1137
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
in terms of uh running distributed

1138
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
queries

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,240
that are go at that near the edge place

1140
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,839
that are going to synthesize the new and

1141
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
the old information

1142
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,040
and we'll talk about this a little bit

1143
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,119
later but the key point here is near the

1144
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,960
edge is kind of a magic place to do

1145
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,040
these things because i'd argue you're

1146
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,680
close enough for latency purposes and

1147
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
you're deep enough into the network to

1148
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,800
get really good sharing of resources

1149
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
so there's some other reasons for

1150
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,160
wanting to be near the edge as well

1151
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,560
one is sovereignty and privacy

1152
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
you may have different jurisdictions

1153
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,839
putting different limits and saying hey

1154
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,839
we don't want information from our state

1155
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,040
going

1156
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,720
to that other state we want you to keep

1157
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,240
it local

1158
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
state country etc

1159
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,920
the federated learning people are

1160
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
actually really quite actively pursuing

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,839
this and looking at this

1162
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,599
lots of opportunities there to do

1163
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,680
machine learning to get essentially

1164
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,760
global models without actually having to

1165
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
feed all of the information

1166
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,720
into a global central core

1167
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,480
my colleagues at vmware have done some

1168
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,560
work to actually take this further by

1169
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,960
using sort of ensembles of models

1170
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
so you could imagine that you have a

1171
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
primary model again that catches most of

1172
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,119
the cases and gives you a fast and cheap

1173
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,480
answer

1174
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
near the edge

1175
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
and then you have secondary models and

1176
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,440
might not be one you might have a bunch

1177
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
of secondary models that are designed to

1178
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,440
capture the you know the sort of more

1179
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,280
specialized cases

1180
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
based on the information that you're

1181
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,119
seeing coming in

1182
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,400
now

1183
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,079
the other reason which i alluded to

1184
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,240
earlier in the talk is that near the

1185
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,320
edge is where the cloud providers meet

1186
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,599
the local

1187
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,240
access providers and i think that as i

1188
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,040
said

1189
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,119
uh creates this sort of

1190
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,200
tussle there's going to be kind of a

1191
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,480
battle for

1192
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
kind of these control points near the

1193
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,599
edge and i think that creates the

1194
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,960
opportunity for the research community

1195
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,920
to sweep in and do something really new

1196
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,839
this term dave clark you know published

1197
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,520
a paper together with some colleagues

1198
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
quite a while ago called tussle in

1199
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,359
cyberspace to sign discussing the kind

1200
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,680
of policy and you know meets technology

1201
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
issues related to the internet and i

1202
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,000
think we're going to see another tussle

1203
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,640
near the edge

1204
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,560
so

1205
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
you know with that in mind there's

1206
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
actually kind of we can sort of see some

1207
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,359
glimmers of this

1208
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,240
in two sets of work going on at berkeley

1209
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,320
some work on essentially introducing a

1210
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,960
layer 3.5 into the network

1211
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
and some work on sky computing

1212
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
these are you know not necessarily aimed

1213
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
near the edge i'm just going to say i

1214
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,240
think that the if you look into them

1215
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,480
that they're very appropriate uh to you

1216
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,440
know kind of overlap with this

1217
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,280
near the edge tussle and near the edge

1218
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,200
agenda and start there's basically

1219
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
glimmers of researchers starting to take

1220
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
on

1221
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
this both challenge and opportunity uh

1222
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
that's coming up where the hyperscalers

1223
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,240
meet the access providers

1224
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,160
okay so it's useful to talk about like

1225
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,839
what's the programming model for all

1226
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,119
this uh this is usenix after all

1227
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
and you know i kind of gave this high

1228
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,480
level uh you know just sketch of what

1229
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,720
functionality you might want

1230
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,319
well to do that you're gonna you know

1231
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,599
what's the plumbing you're going to need

1232
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,200
to make that possible near the edge

1233
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,079
you're going to want to be able to

1234
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,960
facility computation right computation

1235
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
storage information theory at this point

1236
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,480
you've got it

1237
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,839
so we're going to want to get really

1238
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,319
good at installing uh application level

1239
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,640
functionality near the edge and the good

1240
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
news is that you know the the tools to

1241
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
do that are starting to come along right

1242
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,200
there's challenges to do that securely

1243
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
doing it prior with privacy

1244
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,599
uh multi-tenancy

1245
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,200
these are all making sure you have you

1246
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
know good isolation between the tenants

1247
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
these are all big challenges but we are

1248
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,119
starting to see glimmers of this you

1249
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,319
know

1250
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,800
there's aws wavelengths giving you some

1251
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,119
of this kind of capability i think one

1252
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,920
of the interesting things is uh that uh

1253
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
cloudflare uh

1254
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,920
and fastly and a few others are seem to

1255
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,319
be selling on using webassembly as

1256
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,480
almost a lingua franca for

1257
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
uh functionality and and computation

1258
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,280
that goes on you know between the edge

1259
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,800
at a place in the network between the

1260
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
edge uh and the cloud so i think we're

1261
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,119
you know we kind of have a lot of the

1262
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,880
plumbing for this

1263
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,319
i do want to go back to a point i made

1264
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,000
earlier let's not get carried away you

1265
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
could imagine saying oh let me drop web

1266
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,079
assembly code at every you know kind of

1267
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,000
note along the network

1268
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,920
i'm not actually arguing for that in

1269
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,160
this case you know i i did previously in

1270
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,480
my career argue for something similar

1271
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
but for this particular opportunity i

1272
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,200
think we should actually stay focused

1273
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,280
at that millisecond bundle so much as i

1274
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
said let's focus on just delivering sort

1275
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,880
of you know one to ten millisecond

1276
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,280
latency really really well near the edge

1277
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
let's kind of focus on allowing some

1278
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,920
application level functionality at that

1279
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,480
bubble within the network and not say

1280
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,599
we're going to put it you know

1281
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,760
absolutely everywhere so i think we'll

1282
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,920
we'll make more progress doing that now

1283
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,280
having said that there's some things

1284
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
that are missing right that just gets

1285
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,040
the computation i think we need to be

1286
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,240
able to think about how we're going to

1287
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,079
get a lot more storage into those points

1288
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
in the network

1289
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,599
and mechanisms that are going to uncover

1290
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,440
the surprise these are going to be very

1291
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,920
application oriented mechanisms

1292
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
to uncover the surprise at least for the

1293
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,000
most popular applications so here's

1294
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,240
a few ideas there i talked to you know

1295
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,680
earlier i said you know storage in the

1296
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,280
network i think we really need to take

1297
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
another shot at that in terms of uh

1298
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,800
uh in you know content center networking

1299
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,079
type ideas

1300
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
i think that bittorrent had a really

1301
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,800
you know kind of very large idea that

1302
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,760
kind of got hidden in the translation

1303
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,880
uh

1304
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,800
which was what i think of as a recipe

1305
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
model right with bittorrent you have

1306
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,480
that the torrent file

1307
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,520
just kind of describes the object

1308
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,599
somebody can drop the object into the

1309
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,880
cloud

1310
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,480
and into the network and somebody who

1311
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
wants to get that object doesn't they

1312
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,040
don't care not only do they not care

1313
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
which copy they got where they got the

1314
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
copy from

1315
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,599
they don't even care if they you know

1316
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,599
where they get the pieces of the copy

1317
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
all they have to do is go get pieces

1318
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
of the object and assemble those pieces

1319
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,839
in the right way so they just need to

1320
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,079
follow the recipe to pull together the

1321
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,839
object i think that there's a lot more

1322
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,119
that can be

1323
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,280
gained from following that we've got an

1324
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,839
owl paper coming up here later something

1325
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,680
interesting to me is although they sort

1326
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,880
of actually

1327
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,160
you know sort of

1328
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,400
superseded bittorrent in many ways with

1329
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,640
a centralized control plane what's

1330
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,119
really interesting is that they

1331
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,599
ended up designing application specific

1332
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,520
policies so this notion of sort of

1333
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,160
creating application awareness

1334
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,960
in how their cdn operates i think is a

1335
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,440
really interesting move and speaks to

1336
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,520
this notion of you know could we go from

1337
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,119
there to this kind of

1338
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,720
surprise awareness for those

1339
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,000
applications

1340
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,160
so i'm excited to hear that paper later

1341
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,960
we have i think a lot of

1342
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,599
applications are going to be map and gis

1343
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,680
related so you could imagine that we

1344
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,520
could develop some infrastructure near

1345
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,760
the edge that is really good at handling

1346
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,680
that sort of gis information so i think

1347
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,599
that's kind of a particular challenge

1348
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,680
people could take on

1349
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,359
somebody should really design the

1350
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,160
inverse cdn for all of that upstream

1351
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,640
flow and aggregation etc i think that's

1352
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,319
another challenge people should take on

1353
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,440
we can do a lot more with declarative

1354
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,480
methods

1355
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
and particularly i think we can finally

1356
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,720
realize the dream

1357
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,920
of

1358
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,839
materialized views

1359
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,599
and you know the concept there is that

1360
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,000
you can essentially today you know you

1361
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,640
issue a query you get your answer to the

1362
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
from the database uh five minutes later

1363
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,040
you issue the same query to get the new

1364
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,720
answer and you keep having to you know

1365
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,880
issue the query get the answer with

1366
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,720
materialized views the idea is you issue

1367
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
the query once and the answer is

1368
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,400
constantly getting updated

1369
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,000
so imagine if this was happening on a

1370
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,520
global basis and the answers were

1371
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,280
getting updated for you near the edge

1372
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
and auto those materialized views are

1373
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
automatically getting fused with the new

1374
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
information as it comes in i think

1375
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,119
that's something that we could really

1376
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,720
design and achieve and it would serve

1377
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,200
the purposes of many applications

1378
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,720
i'm just going to double click on that a

1379
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,760
little bit

1380
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,440
based on some work that my colleagues at

1381
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,839
vmware and mihi's here can talk about it

1382
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,480
if people want to catch them offline

1383
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,920
because the underlying concept here is

1384
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,200
taking advantage of incremental

1385
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,560
computation

1386
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
right in incremental computation we you

1387
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,839
know we have this notion that if you run

1388
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,520
a program on some inputs you get an

1389
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,640
output

1390
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,960
uh if you want to run the program on a

1391
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
slightly different input unfortunately

1392
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,800
today we rerun the whole program and

1393
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,640
redo the whole calculation

1394
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
but what if we could just do a delta

1395
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,079
calculation

1396
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,920
now unfortunately that's hard to do in

1397
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,599
general

1398
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,839
but it works for databases

1399
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,760
so in the database world we could

1400
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,839
actually have this notion of incremental

1401
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,440
computation

1402
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,520
and folks like miha and len and vmware

1403
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,000
and others

1404
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,680
frank sherry

1405
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,160
have actually made huge progress

1406
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,480
on this sort of differential data flow

1407
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,079
uh and enabling this kind of vision

1408
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,000
now here's the the one that i think is

1409
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,560
the really big opportunity uh beyond

1410
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,400
that which is

1411
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,240
machine learning has the separation of

1412
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,760
training and inference and i think we

1413
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,160
could learn a lot from that

1414
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,680
if you think about it from an

1415
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,839
information theory point of view what

1416
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,800
the training is doing is taking all the

1417
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,359
old information all the priors and

1418
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,920
compressing the heck out of it

1419
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,520
into the model

1420
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,200
and then you can ship the model to near

1421
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,480
the edge

1422
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,240
you take the new information and that's

1423
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,680
when you run the inference that's

1424
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,119
effectively combining the new

1425
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,160
information with this highly compressed

1426
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,760
representation of all the old

1427
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,480
information relevant to your problem

1428
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,720
that seems like a really great model and

1429
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,079
i'm wondering what we could do to

1430
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,319
generalize that design pattern and be

1431
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,839
able to use it for other types of

1432
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,920
applications

1433
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,000
okay so in terms of what's next for

1434
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,640
networking to wrap things up

1435
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,800
we use the tools of our trade but a lot

1436
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,599
more storage in the network and we hoist

1437
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,280
the notion of information theory and

1438
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,760
surprise to the application layer and

1439
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
really take advantage of it

1440
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,000
in a big way i think that's a huge

1441
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,520
opportunity

1442
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,040
just to recap on some of the

1443
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,599
implications we need to really you know

1444
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
kind of think in terms of application

1445
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,920
aware fusion of new information with old

1446
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,119
information

1447
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,440
and doing that near the edge

1448
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
we're doing this to enable proactive

1449
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
computation

1450
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,839
and we need to do that we need to get

1451
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,079
really good at hosting that application

1452
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,160
functionality near the edge that's the

1453
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,559
systems part of that

1454
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,480
and create as i said i don't you know i

1455
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,319
don't think we want everybody for every

1456
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,160
application trying to use that plumbing

1457
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,280
directly

1458
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,440
create a small set of functionality like

1459
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,040
that inverse cdn the materialized views

1460
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,559
perhaps that training inference

1461
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,880
generalized create those sorts of

1462
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,200
capabilities so that people could enable

1463
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,960
large numbers of applications without

1464
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,800
everybody having to figure out how to

1465
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,880
drop their little bit of code

1466
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,720
near the edge manually

1467
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,160
and finally i think we need to move

1468
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,880
beyond this sort of 3g 4g 5g mindset

1469
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,119
and really think that as we go into you

1470
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,119
know future generations

1471
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,640
uh that we're not talking about

1472
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
networking separate from the computation

1473
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,559
we've really got to kind of get a

1474
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,960
refactoring of the access networks and

1475
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,520
the cloud and the internet

1476
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,920
and focus you know one way to i think to

1477
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
do that is for the next decade just

1478
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,160
focus on this sort of one to ten

1479
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,800
millisecond latency achieving that near

1480
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,079
the edge

1481
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,000
and focus on this place where the

1482
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,599
hyperscalers

1483
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,680
meet the access providers and create a

1484
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,280
revolution there

1485
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,520
so i think it's a great opportunity to

1486
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,400
refactor networking

1487
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,160
and enable the next generation of

1488
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,640
systems and networking rebels

1489
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,960
and rebels wanted

1490
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,200
thank you

1491
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,079
you
