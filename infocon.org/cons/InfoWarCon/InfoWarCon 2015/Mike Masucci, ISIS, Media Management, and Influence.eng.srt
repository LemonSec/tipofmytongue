last two days I've had a number of

28
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:37,419
revelations that hopefully I can use

29
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:43,210
them in to whatever say I'll have a very

30
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:44,740
short in the context of what I do um but

31
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,109
I first want to say there was a room

32
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,639
realization actually and having a lunch

33
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,000
conversation with this young

certain vantage point and hopefully will

43
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,879
inform this discussion in ways that

44
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,669
don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen although I suspect</font>

45
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,759
among your peers many of these

46
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,889
conversations do happen ah first

47
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,169
operational definition there's Hollywood

48
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,439
and there is Hollywood I am of off

49
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:42,878
hollywood there are Los Angeles is the

00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:45,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">cultural capital of two forms of world</font>

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:53,289
very well popular culture but on Richard

53
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,509
mentioned post-world war two and largely

54
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:59,529
seated initially and this is absolute

55
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:03,639
fact by the CIA as a cold war tactic

56
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:06,129
there was the rise of a wholly American

57
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,430
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> art form whose name has changed</font>

58
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:11,589
a number of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the first</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">name they act had and then they have</font>

60
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:17,680
jumped that was free enterprise painting

61
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,229
they replaced that with abstract

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,149
conceptualism he said splintered off

63
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:29,409
into a dozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> different genres</font>

psych ops in my humble opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> chickens</font>

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,150
of the largest purchasers of this work

87
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,730
obviously the UK obviously America the

88
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,719
point is though that there's a kind of

89
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,730
visual vocabulary and that's a term I

90
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,850
want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have throughout this little</font>

91
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,250
talk there is a visual vocabulary of

92
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether combining traditional narrative</font>

93
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,370
storytelling with the thousands and

thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of image making that</font>

95
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,800
we have done going back to La Scala and

96
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,950
actually they found even earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> cave</font>

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,880
paintings in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> future so as long as</font>

98
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:13,539
there have been the modern humans there

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:16,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the various languages that we</font>

100
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,360
use to communicate which of words are

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,090
others um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldnt i first talked</font>

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outsider entering your world</font>

105
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,610
and looking at things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise I</font>

106
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,549
would have never looked at and look at

arm I didn't know what I was going to

112
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:56,890
expect I had heard the common cliches

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,600
these videos are really good well as

114

UCLA or a afire NYU maybe they did but

121
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,540
they didn't have to because of the world

122
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,790
you've created this networked world

123
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,230
where there are thousands of tutorials

124
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:32,949
on every aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything including</font>

125
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:36,970
filmmaking they absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not have</font>

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,720
using video as a tool for political

149
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,510
terror political change depends on your

150
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,240
vantage point but when Daniel Pearl was

151
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,810
beheaded on camera

152
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,660
for me this conversation began in a

153
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,689
different way um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an image</font>

154
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,899
created in 2005 by my partner Kay

155
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,700
Johnson um we take those<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

156
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,310
she's made some of the largest projected

157
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,980
images that humans have ever made she

158
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,229
makes videos to get projected not just

159
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:23,310
on one but in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> five building</font>

160
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:29,459
simultaneous<font color="#CCCCCC"> video art it's not hips are</font>

161
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:32,819
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Disney it's a whole other order</font>

162
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:35,189
of being on this picture obviously this

163
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,970
is a still from the video but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

164
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,940
see in 2005 Kate was thinking about a

165
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,250
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do artists do artists</font>

166
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,310
don't answer questions they<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise them</font>

167
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,310
that's what they do any artist who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

168
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:53,010
decent is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who just makes a</font>

169
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:57,510
picture they are someone who asks a

170
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:03,149
question what is Kate asking privacy

171
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:05,430
information data alienation all of the

172
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,550
things this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference is touched on in</font>

173
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:15,329
various ways um next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please we</font>

174
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:18,420
draw him down her up<font color="#E5E5E5"> redwood the same</font>

year<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was making this digital animation</font>

176
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,640
again it's still from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video 2005</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

177
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,700
sure there's a lot of difference

178
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,220
opinions as to about the strategy our

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,800
nation<font color="#CCCCCC"> was taking in 2005 I have my</font>

180
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,070
questions my questions are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen</font>

181
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,410
um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to agree with them you</font>

182
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:42,110
don't have to disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them but</font>

183
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,110
what an artist does is asked questions

184
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,870
the little group my place is called is

185
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,550
not the bittorrent by the same name

186
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,490
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is much younger and stole our name</font>

187
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,189
to which every day we get email soon I

188
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,360
can't download Nashville I don't do it

189
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,640
dude

190
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:06,519
why not tell you eztv is now in its 36th

191
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,399
year we are arguably the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

193
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,589

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,029
personal video but the digital

195
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:20,980
revolution and we were very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very early</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">compadres with you guys in using what</font>

201
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:38,680
young artists through paint boxes made a

202
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,630

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:52,810
authorship of the chat room we did a

207
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,310
chat room um we then on to create what

208
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,119
was arguably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first digital art</font>

209
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,910
gallery<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world um so we know your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the neighborhood we're the content</font>

213
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't know how you protect what we all

214
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,550
do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really do know how important it</font>

215
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,769
is what you're doing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how important</font>

216
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,189
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we protect this fragile</font>

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:25,480
little thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have all built</font>

218
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:28,839
together and I say all because the fact

219
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,760
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter is when we use computers</font>

220
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:36,579
as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of them today we are largely</font>

221
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,010
using the intellectual authorship from

222
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,500
artists because they were artists that

223
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,350
said to engineers well it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool</font>

if community to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the color purple</font>

can start to be calm photorealistic it

229
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,170
was a guy like David am a painter by

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,940
artist in residence and then

235
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,970
back and forth until he finally said oh

236
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,880
we can do fly by simulations of your

win a MacArthur Genius and much of what

240
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:30,140
everyone from Hollywood to Isis was

241
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,520
imagined first by artists and then

242
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,680
realized by collaborative engineers I

243
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,930
picked this slide out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

that were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> created by what i</font>

call artists scientists like Rebecca

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Allen Rebecca went to art school about a

262
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,360
BFA from Rhode Island School of Design

263
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,840
and then went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to MIT and got a master's</font>

264
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,180
in computer science in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do her</font>

265
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,880
art she didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a computer</font>

266
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,829
scientist but she needed that because

267
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,160
back then calarts didn't teach digital

268
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,490
art that horrible generation did that

269
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,949
she went out to create UCLA's<font color="#E5E5E5"> school of</font>

Department women matter in all Hollywood

273
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,920
most of the kind of stuff I do though is

274
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">not about what I think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more or</font>

the evolution of the universe um someone

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,210
did presentation yesterday about drones

simultaneously infiltrate any continent

309
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:46,460
and perform both recruitment and terror

lot of times I hear how state-of-the-art

Isis's videos are and as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

316
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,310
little bit later or just what a small

shopping basket you need they have to

318
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:15,649
use an art phrase high-concept they

319
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:19,040
really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to use a tool in</font>

320
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,710
its most informed way maximizing the

321
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,270
historical legacy of all that's come

322
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:29,540
before and do it precisely for their

323
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,910
objective what surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

324
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,649
when I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> these videos and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will put</font>

327
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:43,040
very very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is out there</font>

328
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:46,280
but in order to do what I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

329
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,860
to talk to you today I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

330
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,580
where these things are and see what they

331
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,309
were what I was surprised to see is that

332
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,409
they had mastered<font color="#CCCCCC"> the art of advertising</font>

333
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,129
they had mastered<font color="#CCCCCC"> the art of the music</font>

337
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:15,970
do that no they might have but they

338
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,879
didn't have to so since everything is a

339
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:23,540
comparative relative in order to think

340
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,540
how their stuff is good I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

341
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,080
what our teen had so I looked around

342
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:33,470
that vintage around the time that al

353

<font color="#E5E5E5">was a time that this was terrifying and</font>

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,710
not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would casually pass by</font>

used

365

as instruments of terror or if we detach

hard to believe it still<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's relevant</font>

372
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,800
today and that's poetic spy Aristotle we

think of Aristotle in many different

ways again depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> around specialties</font>

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,139
well he was actually also a theater

377
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:31,160
career um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> back then there was no</font>

378
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:35,630
notion of artists or scientists you were

379
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:38,690
both and to me a good scientist has the

380
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,900
heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an artist and a good artist has</font>

the heart of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scientists and the</font>

greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences and when I</font>

401
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,590

me directors talk about two kinds of

truth there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actual treasure actual</font>

431
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,540
truth is I am 62 years old I was born in

the Bronx I'm standing here right now

433
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,629
but then there's emotional truth

434
00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:00,500
emotional truth is Ben Affleck born in

438
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,600
emotional truth and I'm sorry our tax

439
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:17,580
dollars paid for this and I

440
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,129
no who in our beloved world okayed this

441
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,179
but they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different work or</font>

442
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">no it's just or big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or go on so the</font>

443
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:34,530
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initially with our side</font>

444
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:37,740
of the fence is that we don't play

445

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,970
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody cares about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

450
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">really concerned that we all together</font>

451
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,939
figure out ways to guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can</font>

452
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,550
go off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do ridiculous things that</font>

453
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,900
nobody cares about because that is

454
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:06,360
what's left of freedom and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is even</font>

455
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,570
though the nonsensical pneus of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA</font>

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,310
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract expressionism and just</font>

457
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,530
to fill a nothing because it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

458
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,899
great story so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the cliches</font>

459
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,910
of Soviet paintings a couple of very

460
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,180
very fit people standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of a</font>

461
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:26,460
track<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so but that was Sony an</font>

462
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,600
art so what we said is no dudes of

463
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,160
course they didn't say it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way i'm</font>

464
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,699
sure they said it with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yale pedigree</font>

465
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:38,340
Oh down to Soho the crappiest

466
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,960
neighborhood in Manhattan where these

467
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:46,560
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are throwing painted canvases</font>

468
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:50,070
that's freedom we allow that we not only

469
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,190
allow that we buy that and who oddly

470
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:56,550
enough were the first customers of that

471
00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:00,720
stuff certainly not the progresses the

472
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:04,550
Rockefellers huh liberal Republicans

473
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,620
more than anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> first fueled</font>

474
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">contemporary art in this country and</font>

475
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:16,770
they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a weapon of the Cold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> War</font>

476
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:19,410
so what's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side by the way this</font>

477
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,970
thing cost a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

478
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,280
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be overly put a camera in</font>

479
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,100
the helicopter now now it's too steady

480
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,139
it's a crane shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they put a gobo</font>

481
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,059
look like the side of a fake helicopter

482
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,090
window and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought it down six</font>

483
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:36,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">feet it is so staged it is so calculated</font>

484
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,449
it is so choreographed it has no

485
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,549
emotional truth the next thing I

486
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,030
calculate costs pretty much nothing to

487
00:28:41,549 --> 00:29:37,520
make and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be the next next next</font>

488
00:28:45,030 --> 00:29:42,059
video this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side coming soon</font>

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,190
coming soon those two words that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

490
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,440
film industry's been using for almost a

491
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,240
century to entice you to come back next

492
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,330
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> i buy another bucket of popcorn</font>

dogs we know who the heck knows what

495

they're made of coming soon yeah they

496
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:07,620
had to rip us off well it's called

497
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:09,629
appropriation they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come at us</font>

498
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,789
with anything they're wrong oh that's

499
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you couldn't be more right when I</font>

500
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:19,250
said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hybrid of</font>

501
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:23,280
reality TV documentary music video

502
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,860
advertising most documentaries today are

503
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,649
largely using footage not of their

504
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,780
origin it's a completely accepted race

505
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,690
if you're doing a movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> World War</font>

506
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,149

507
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,190
you're using somebody elses footage it

508
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,650
is completely that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term is</font>

509
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,150
appropriate that's the politically

510
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,480
correct term for just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking other</font>

511
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,520
people's stuff and it's and in in

512
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,799
another ridiculously overused word

513
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:55,408
post-modernism um this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

514
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,049
personification of a postmodernist piece

when I said he<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost just about nothing</font>

516
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:05,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I calculated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is any one of a number</font>

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,720
of either they generated the flame

520
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,299
particle itself but more likely yeah

521
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,530
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stole a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> premade clip of some</font>

522
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:22,110
DJ software as a transition but what

523
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:27,709
they did you where I would say they did

524
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:32,369
have a voice that scares me they're sad

525
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:35,719
was so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more theatrical than the US</font>

526
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:39,359
Army not only did the US Army have

527
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:40,889
ridiculously stage shots all of which

528
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,809
were clearly fake even though i don't

529
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:44,698
doubt they're real soldiers they are

530
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:47,158
real soldiers sir okay look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

531
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:49,829
camera look nice okay everybody want you

532
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:56,339
to cut turn do you don't listen this is

533
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:59,849
all real<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to me I understand many</font>

534
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:03,049
people and I accept it is true that the

535
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:05,759
human mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a very real difficulty</font>

536
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:08,969
differentiating between seeing a

537
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:15,389
fictional movie and seeing a documentary

538
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:20,549
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the real thing resonates at</font>

539
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:26,458
an ever so slight leakage now why do I

540
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:30,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that worked because it used it</font>

541
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:34,499
used truly the vernacular the visual

542
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:36,629
vocabulary of the people intended to see

543
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:39,149
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it used all the same</font>

544
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:40,468
techniques the army one had to me an

545
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:43,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">over use of something called color</font>

546
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:45,899
grading that's sort of yeah I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

547
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:48,289
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the movie Top Gun yeah</font>

548
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:52,139
that increased the recruitment for the

549
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. naval aviation and US Air Force</font>

550
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,458
absolutely but from an outside

551
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:59,069
perspective that's kind of it's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

552
00:32:56,459 --> 00:33:01,739
right well what I never get in my mind

553
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:03,089
but I behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's very different</font>

554
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also tight back to what you</font>

555
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,299
mentioned when we evaluate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality</font>

556
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:08,609
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we always have to have</font>

557
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:10,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the potential target audience in mind is</font>

558
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:12,928
it a disenfranchised young suburban mail

559
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:15,569
or an Arab background or is it an

college that's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy I believe</font>

563
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:27,029
that's the case but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying is</font>

564
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:30,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if I were in this time seeing if I</font>

it's an invitation to a cam yeah that's

571
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,450
a tough care if you gotta climb up stuff

anything about you get to the lobby by

one if overcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completely agree that</font>

591
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,720
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they were paid to do and</font>

592
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:46,000
the audience was not people overseas but

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,580
not the toothless big Pentagon big money

597
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,260
recruiting stuff from the domestic

598
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,089
audience need to actually compare the

599
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,790
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> were being put out to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

doesn't work it up crafty devil sakes

602
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:06,280
there was some strong that's just

603
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,320
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heartland wheat ones</font>

604
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,359
I'm sure you would I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

605
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,580
reviews on them well my little

606
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,859
understand you thank you very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

607
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,799
my little understanding is that they

608
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:20,950
were actually difficult to access that

609
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,900
that if I were someone if I were over

610
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:28,480
there I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be within certain</font>

611
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,000
communities to actually have access to

612
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that material</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where is today thanks to</font>

613
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,670
the neural of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet um that's the</font>

614
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:41,589
longer the case again just like with the

615
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:46,540
top analogy we have to assess this with

616
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:48,819
the playing field of today because 2004

617
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,740
was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different world and whenever</font>

618
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:55,500
the heck taco was made 20th century

619
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,209
lucia's baby please<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what other</font>

620
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,380
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stood up your video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

621
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:03,360
should was the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> street footage of</font>

622
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House yeah it was actually</font>

623
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,560
trying to strike at the White House

624
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,060
little that's right in there that person

625
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was a good piece of symbology</font>

626
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:16,049
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now organization yes yeah</font>

627
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,150
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean again it's like i'll say this</font>

628
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:24,840
later when we get to play a<font color="#E5E5E5"> game called</font>

629
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:26,340
fuck the photo shot but um<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't</font>

630
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,390
joined the college in a long assignment

631
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:33,060
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i were going to assess those two</font>

632
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,830
pieces one would<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very higher</font>

633
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:40,920
grade than the other because it one of

634
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:43,170
them really uses even in its quick just

635
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,890
because you own mine recognizes images

636
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">very fast um it says that whole thing it</font>

637
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:53,250
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use your correction you</font>

638
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,500
want to kill oh yeah you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kill</font>

639
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,350
your neighbors but don't you all want

640
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> annika</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's its energy its</font>

641
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,600
progression ille it leads to that end

642
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that video with when its hand by</font>

643
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,220
it looked like it was a cell phone video

644
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:11,070
you know talking by so it shows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

645
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,129
can strike at you and it from the

646
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,960
shadows it's my belief that the higher

647
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,390
the production value with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

648
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,690
the worst the impact the more they look

649
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:25,500
like things they could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the</font>

650
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:27,390
more is yet another kind of embracement

651
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,600
now artists are always dealing with well

652
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,810
gee what what production level do we

653
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:36,089
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this piece in because we</font>

654
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,680
don't want it to be alienating now a lot

655
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,750
of people love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Disney but I'm sorry most</font>

656
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,940
people can't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Disney film we're</font>

657
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,619
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not huh think it a success of the</font>

658
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,510
Blair Witch Project absolutely

659
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:50,070
absolutely but let me point out a

660
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:52,920
problem that I'm sorry it originated in

661
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:56,160
Hollywood uh the board of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

662
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,220
this example I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely devil</font>

663
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,720
incarnate you can't handle the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

664
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,319
what you know we have been told since

665
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,209
the 1950s since beaver and all the the

666
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,940
absolutes acronyms

667
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,270
we kind of shows that aren't allowed to

668
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,060
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> the belly buttons aren't allowed to</font>

669
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:18,180
show any sex uh we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

670
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,910
violence all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that that that</font>

671
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,520
that the video from<font color="#CCCCCC"> al Jazeera actually</font>

672
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,848
showed that we are not allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

673
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,220
because we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it I agree with it</font>

674
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,200
now I mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hold a reaction</font>

675
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide a little bit</font>

676
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,129
later which is also a slide that's going

677
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,560
to reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question Spencer gave to</font>

678
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,800
me but but I i am not going to avoid

679
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,240
what you're busy i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am going to please</font>

680
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,070
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a ting and perhaps a very</font>

681
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,348
surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm certainly done you may</font>

682
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,960
address this but what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

683
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:50,940
something package<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that yeah how</font>

684
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,420
international is the audience is it work

685
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,849
just here for you change you know

686
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,700
English took Darcy well changes yeah um

687
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,400
my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ninety percent of it is very</font>

688
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,770
international again the first one have

689
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the narration I'm guessing I I think</font>

690
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,490
country music's great but I'm no expert

691
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,470
in my guess is the narrator is a

692
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,509
recognizable native country<font color="#CCCCCC"> history</font>

693
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:16,259
that's a guess and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I'm running on</font>

694
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,660
but it has narration that immediately

695
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,170
cuts off the vast majority apart yeah

696
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,618
most people speak broken English but um

697
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:28,859
when you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> away the language and</font>

698
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:31,589
start using visual language you've got a

699
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:34,020
much bigger audience the reason action

700
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:36,330
films are so so successful

701
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,009
internationally now than they were 30

702
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,319
years ago it's a lot less talking in

703
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,599
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> less dialogue it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

704
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,730
hey watch out but there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

705
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like avatar movie</font>

706
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">where people are sitting there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

707
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,210
minutes having a discussion about us you

708
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as essentialism um and that's my</font>

709
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,430
design honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like somebody made a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

710
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,920
crack at Michael Bay and I'm certainly

711
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,500
no fan of his as an artist but he is no

712
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,339
fool he knows exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he is doing</font>

713
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,849
and there is there's some critique among

714
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:10,440
the sinister those pretentious<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox like</font>

715
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:15,330
me who think they understand film

716
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,490
culture um that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the</font>

717
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,009
return to the silent film they would

718
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,790
call transformers<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside</font>

719
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:27,210
film because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is largely action-driven</font>

720
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:29,070
rather than dialogic and you could take

721
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:34,530
away the words and pretty much still

722
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:36,620
good and that is specifically to build

723
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,970
what they have successfully done a

724
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:42,450
situation where we now sell more tickets

725
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,310
overseas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw and that was a</font>

726
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:48,960
design that happened quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

727
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:51,080
ago again learning from visual art

728
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,510
saying well what is it about bathing

729
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">local story right then I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

730
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,030
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a couple</font>

731
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,060
things I want to get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

732
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:03,120
what you guys had so this is again CNN

733
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,390
from last week like a new rock band

734
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,890
storming the music charts Isis benefited

735
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,170
from a music video environment that

736
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,910
amplifies its propaganda the group

737
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,100
quickly reached early recruits through

738
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,350
videos that showcase the fear its

739
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:21,720
adherents instilled in non-believers

740
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:23,640
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> music</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> review band they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">why i said before let's not mince words</font>

744
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:37,740
these are snuff films for decades upon

745
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,319
decades upon decades there has in an

746

747
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,720
vary greatly from where you could spend

748
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:50,460
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch an actual human being get</font>

749
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,859
killed then in the probably 80s maybe

750
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,470
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s a.m. they were really</font>

753
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,670
faces of death face yeah yeah where you

754
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">could buy a VHS tape where you could see</font>

755
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,640
a Saudi beheading where you could see

756
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,609
some terrible car accident with an ibex

757
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,629
with and a half there has always been

758
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:20,010
the snuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the snuffle to my</font>

759
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:25,640
knowledge was not used as high concept

760
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:29,960
and as a weapon of war<font color="#CCCCCC"> fare until Daniel</font>

761
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:33,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's what these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are these are</font>

762
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,390
videos that for various reasons

763
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,750
people decide to watch so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

764
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:43,680
see other human beings killed in gas

765
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:47,280
regrets that's what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they just</font>

766
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,740
happen to not only terrify us but they

767
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,220
happen to turn on some of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

768
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:57,348
I was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country of gutter and then</font>

769
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,348
Afghanistan when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pearl was guilt and</font>

770
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,690
there was a violent<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction to it that</font>

771
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,390
was not what they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that's</font>

772
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,880
why the film's basically stopped because

773
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,890
they've realized said and they alienated

774
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,940
the target audience very very badly and

775
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:16,618
uh there was a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> called I'm sorry</font>

776
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,960
it worked well in Chechnya when these

777
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:23,490
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> started well chicken Russians are</font>

778
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,650
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but oh gosh calm was it</font>

779
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:27,328
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website that showed all this stuff</font>

780
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then they got bought out by</font>

781
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:33,900
life leak and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden um overs</font>

782
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,640
went away and bought out by bought by

783
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,220
lively and for a little while they ran

784
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,379
all the really bad snuff films and then

785
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:43,828
that went away because there was such a

786
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:47,069
violent reaction to it so the America as

787

game companies put out different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

831
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,328
modding the games themselves to know

832
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:49,828

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the many many tactics that the</font>

a very very tiny part of this image what

901
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:41,939
is terrifying about this image this

902
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,750
gigantic work of art now it's not art

903
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:49,730
for nice people but it is a work of art

911
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,930
the bigger your artwork yeah the raw

913
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:18,240
but it's not substantially different but

914
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:23,010
it's quantitatively more valuable the

915
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:28,290
bigger scale matters scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>
