00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,670
are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and get started</font>

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,469
all right why did I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> max action</font>

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:23,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's hear a round of applause that was</font>

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:49,379
great man 24 me a scotch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you</font>

5
00:00:23,939 --> 00:01:00,390
got recording oh yeah comfortable there

6
00:00:49,379 --> 00:01:01,920
you know I don't eat like this is

7
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,890
different type of I don't know if I

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:25,650
should be lecturing or<font color="#CCCCCC"> lap dancing I</font>

9
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:29,280
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see this man everybody</font>

10
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,650
caffeinated ready to go all right well

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
welcome and you know thanks again to the

12
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,840
short out family for hosting us all here

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,759
what a great venue in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring a</font>

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,040
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us together my experience at</font>

15
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,170
input work on goes back over 21 years

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,240
just kind of scary when you think about

17
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,579
it right it's legally old enough to

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,579
drink and skipped a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in between</font>

19
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,479
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been probably just about</font>

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,219
everyone that's been held I think at

21
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,659
this point and spoken at most of them

22
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and for a couple of years when and I</font>

23
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,640
actually combined<font color="#E5E5E5"> info work on with my</font>

24
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,229
TRC con which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,579
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terrorism folks</font>

26
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,289
talking with the information warfare

27
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,000
folks and how many probably remember

28
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,860
that session when we had general downing

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,540
and guys like that that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were learning</font>

30
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,260
a lot of lessons on both sides of the

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,810
equation I give a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of presentations</font>

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,750
and I probably

33
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,630
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in the prior 30 days</font>

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next 30 days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll speak in front of</font>

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,799
20 audiences this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate presentations I'm presenting</font>

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,010
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> boards of directors and talking</font>

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> risks and talking about risk</font>

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,230
management but for me info work on was

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,450
always something beyond that it was kind

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,040
of pushing us to that kind of next level

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,260
of discussion and thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font>

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so to kick this off what I</font>

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,410
decided to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something completely</font>

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">different you notice the viewfinder</font>

46
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,750
might slide presentation is all photos

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,290
and really for me what it is is

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,540
basically to set up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

49
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,040
markers with regards to what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

50
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be talking about not only at</font>

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this event but at future events in order</font>

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,970
for this to be successful as well as

53
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,190
throw down a couple of markers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,870
with regards to where we've been and

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,329
where we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going so with that you know</font>

56
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">will tune in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the viewmaster the first</font>

57
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,230
thing I ever calls you we were talking

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues over 20 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,579
when we were right right i mean there

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,190
was definitely the emergence of conflict

61
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,280
in this space are critical dependencies

62
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,380
on infrastructure that was inherently

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200
dependent on the use of information

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,680
technology and increasingly utilized by

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,420

other day when<font color="#CCCCCC"> my team showed me the</font>

skate a control sister of one of our

large<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil customers and I was used to</font>

Chris hacking in and the command line

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,620
into these SCADA systems and they

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,299
brought up a nice point in quick display

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,760
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> me worried that they're going</font>

75
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to shut off a refinery valve just by an</font>

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,660
arid mouse click frightens me not only

77
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted these technologies but</font>

78
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,930
we've adopted them in full scope this

79
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,989
will be familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to many folks presented</font>

80
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,209
this at info work on 20 years ago

81
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented it subsequently with Sweden so</font>

82
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,930
I just thought it'd be interesting to

83
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,510
think you know aware did we see targets

84
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,548
across this matrix and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

85
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,849
we can check all the boxes at this point

86
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,770
right which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of interesting we've</font>

87
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,860
seen the physical unphysical obviously

88
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,620
the physical on digital the digital on

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,030
physical and when things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Stuxnet</font>

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,529
and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the digital on</font>

91
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,018
digital we were seeing here

00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,849
emergence of 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so interesting</font>

93
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,349
to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we thought about how is</font>

94
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,029
this how our infrastructure is going to

95
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:42,119
be attacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future with this real</font>

our infamous toaster paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just told i</font>

99
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,378
could go through the session without

100
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,639
mentioning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> toaster paper if you want</font>

to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">attention of the policymakers we have</font>

108
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,239
their attention now we have to figure

00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,029
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with it not if you follow</font>

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the legislative activity that's</font>

111
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:18,389
taking place in the US etc we have the

<font color="#E5E5E5">full attention of the folks not only the</font>

political domain in the business

114
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,849
conveyed in the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

115
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:27,299
briefed more boards of directors that I

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,128
did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prior 15 years combined right</font>

117
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:30,419
so we have their intention i think

118
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,459
there's a key mission there that now

119
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,709
that we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention what is the</font>

120
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,389
message that we want to convey we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

121
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,279
want to go back in time and convey the

122
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,439
message we were conveying 20 years ago

123
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to figure out what are the new</font>

124
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,099
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are important not only</font>

125
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,438
important right now but what is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,329
be important the next five to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years i</font>

127
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:54,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">will talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

128
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:56,939
later I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all agree there's</font>

129
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,919
been a kind of fundamental failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

130
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,509
security and not security at the

131
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,248
practitioner level i would say security

132
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the management level and the reason</font>

133
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:06,319
why I've been kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of accepted this</font>

134
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:10,229
model is secure right technically that

135
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,419
chain is held together right but as if

136
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,609
you can't see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zip tie holds two</font>

137
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,579

138
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:19,529
model that has been allowed to

139
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,879
perpetrate at least you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

140
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,549
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in the commercial side in a</font>

141
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,709
commercial sense as we focused on things

142
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,709
like compliance based security and

143
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:31,199
standards-based security and allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

144
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,449
to be kind of a checkbox approach well

145
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box can be checked that this gate is</font>

146
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,489
locked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not anywhere near secure</font>

147
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,739
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot that we need</font>

148
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:43,409
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss to kind of address some of</font>

149
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:46,369
those failures that have been instituted

150
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,369
over the course of time

151
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,749
this is another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to address</font>

152
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,219
as well we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

153
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:02,949
terrorism and things of those sorts

going back I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even in wins first</font>

book we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about cyber terrorism</font>

156
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:10,360
but I really feel like in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain</font>

157
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,060
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enter into the age of</font>

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,249
asymmetric threats right where there are

159
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,949
going to be individuals that are bad

160
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:20,379
actors that are that have a

161
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,870
disproportionate power to have an impact

162
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">on us through their attacks if you</font>

163
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,080
followed the story of the attack against

164
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,090
Sony from what I've read in the open

165
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,159
sources literally the team had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

166
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,500
North Korea because they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

167
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,060
infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> went to a hotel and</font>

168
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,139
then they downloaded all the tools and

169
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,180
technologies that they needed to

170
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,759
perpetrate that attack right so kind of

171
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,249
a rogue nation state<font color="#CCCCCC"> sponsor type of</font>

172

attack the terrorist organizations have

173
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:52,300
certainly ventured into the cyber domain

174
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,310
for propaganda recruitment we know that

175
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,620
there's interest in engaging in attacks

176
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,409
it's just a matter of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I want to</font>

177
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure is we focus on these you know</font>

178
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,949
state-sponsored attack issues and we

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,839
also start thinking about the asymmetric

180
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,879
aspects of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> no there's several folks</font>

181
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,259
that will be speaking to that over the

182
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,110
course of two days but I think it's

183
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,550
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the fact that we</font>

184
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,460
have a lot of threat actors out there

that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of super empowered to</font>

engage in attacks we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font>

196
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:50,140
interesting kind of hyper criminals that

197
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:54,160
can exist out there this is my first

198
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,199
wrote a paper in 1999 about trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

words of cyber conflict but I can tell

202
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,940
you now just based on things I've

203
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,810
witnessed over the past 12 to 18 months

204

the mercenary /<font color="#E5E5E5"> private contractor angle</font>

as it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging in offensive</font>

people to those called<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

218
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,760
outcomes which was a play on executive

outcomes ill mercenary outfit it was a

joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the reality is we're going to</font>

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,680
have these very financially motivated

may be affiliated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> states maybe not</font>

223
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,939
kind of mercenary type actors that are

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get very active in the computer</font>

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,350
or network offense domain and so we need

226
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about the implications of</font>

227
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,090
what from my perspective is kind of a

228
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,620
new actor if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very wealthy</font>

229
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,260
foreign governments and maybe are

230
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,120
closely aligned with some of our

231
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,890
countries that want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire specialized</font>

232
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,870
skill sets to engage in offensive

233
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:26,500
attacks how are we going to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

234
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:28,450
that reality and hear a lot about the

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,450
the Internet of Things and obviously

236
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,090
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a growing security concern but</font>

237
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,090
I'm also very curious and interested in

238
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,440
kind of the sky if we look at what's

239
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,670
been happening and I know this is

240
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys covered last</font>

241
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,079
year as well with the emergence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all</font>

242
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,270
of the things we're just allowing into

243
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,670
the sky the amateur drone initiatives

244
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,090
the fact that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a helicopter</font>

245
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a whatever that I'm friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

246
00:10:52,090 --> 00:11:00,370
the solo copter land on the lawn of the

247
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,320
Congressional lon in DC drones being

248
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,940
used for delivery drone platforms being

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,330
used by governments I think that becomes

250
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,620
very curious guetta area from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">perspectives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these things flying above us and what is</font>

253
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:19,930
already you could

254
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:22,389
argue a fairly crowded space<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another</font>

255
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,029
one with regards to our conception of

256
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,410
time I get asked two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago to go in</font>

257
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,819
red team the chairman of the Joint

258
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,439
Chiefs strategy for 2020 and it was a

259
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,779
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> honor there are eight of us on the</font>

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,519
red team and the first issue that I

261
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,399
raised was why are we only thinking

262
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,410
about 2020 which at the time was you

263
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,600
know eight years away when we have

264
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,639
adversaries that are thinking in a much

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,529
longer time space I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of our</font>

266
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,050
great failings in this space and I think

267
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,449
one of the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> value propositions of</font>

268
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,029
info work on is that this should be the

269
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:56,889
space that we're projecting out thinking

270
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,350
about the future thinking about some of

271
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:03,100
the grand strategy implications because

272
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,259
for certain our attackers are for when

273
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,579
I'm asked most often about what I'm

274
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security right</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">now the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't talk about</font>

about d das I talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concept</font>

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:21,100
called strategic penetration for future

280
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,980
that is to say prior to world war two

explosives in the ball bearing plants of

the button but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do wind up in</font>

289
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,329
conflict of them being able to push that

290
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,609
button<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be so you have</font>

291
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,229
hugely strategically advantageous to

292
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,810
diminish that capability and they're

293
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">more making machine do you say yes how</font>

294
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:59,709
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say yes you raise your hands</font>

295
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,959
what yours it all right it will just say

296
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,239
priors you prior to come to put the old

297
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:10,449
or too we're so<font color="#E5E5E5"> set on high speed</font>

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">reaches so similar type of concepts so</font>

299
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,599
the realist in me of course is yes you

300
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,100
know I can do it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

301
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have to blow things up I</font>

302
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,269
can do without attribution it will give

303
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,819
me advantage in the future if I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

304
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,439
you have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the adversaries</font>

305
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:25,979
attacking our critical infrastructure in

306
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:28,709
that same context do that

307
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,780
knees have the intent to take down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

308
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,960
power grid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States right</font>

309
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,470
now do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the intent when</font>

310
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,000
capability do they have the intent do

311
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,580
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the intent right now to take</font>

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">down that right economic interdependence</font>

313
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,450
fear of escalation fear of global

314
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,560
condemnation there's all these kind of

315
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,660
classical deterrence that are in place

316
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Chinese can envision though a time</font>

317
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,819
in the future if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about time</font>

318
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,380
shifting intent now right they can

319
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,380
envision a time in the future where they

320
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">might want to take down a power put over</font>

321
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,920
a regional security issue or an economic

322
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,800
security issue over just some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

323
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,390
traditional conflict so if you know if

324
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,189
you put yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the perspective of</font>

325
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,990
that time shifted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 saying hey I</font>

326
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,830
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this what do you need</font>

327
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be doing right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now oh oh yeah you</font>

328
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,640
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be owning that critical</font>

329
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,470
infrastructure right so what I think

330
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about security threats and security</font>

331
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,700
risks and in this concept of time

332
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:30,270
shifted intent we need to be thinking

333
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,470
about if our adversaries are considering

334
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they might need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take critical</font>

335
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,830
infrastructure down five or 10 years

336
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,660
from now what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to be doing</font>

337
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,360
and that should be guiding some of our

338
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,370
stuff and then on the corollary a

339
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,430
corollary what do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing</font>

340
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the next 8 10 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

341
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,020
space and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we did a really good</font>

342
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,880
job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 20 years ago of projecting</font>

343
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,300
forward I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we do is get a job</font>

344
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,240
of it today because we're so overwhelmed

345
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,240
by you know history catching up with us

346
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:06,720
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw this up here for this is a</font>

347
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:10,200
difficult space for me to to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font>

348
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,700
the kind of open source sense but i'll

349
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,110
just say more<font color="#E5E5E5"> russia and less china</font>

350
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,950
right which regards to what we should be

351
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,820
thinking about there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

352
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:23,400
incredible level of attention paid to

353
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">china sponsored activities a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of that</font>

354
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,280
surrounding intellectual property theft

355
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,590
I've gone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the record and another</font>

356
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,970
event saying that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

357
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:35,310
intellectual property theft is a

358
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term problem right it you can only</font>

359
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,709
steal so much before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

360
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,660
achieve some sort of parody

361
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,280
where the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend in</font>

362
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,360
stealing the incremental improvement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

363
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I p is less valuable to you than the</font>

364
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,970
money that you can spend on innovation

365
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
in your own country we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

366
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,710
starting to see that shift but within

367
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,410
China<font color="#E5E5E5"> would venture funds being stood up</font>

368
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,850
focused on specific industries etc so

369
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,560
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backbone of all the IP</font>

370
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,420
that they've previously stolen from us

371
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,910
but it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

372
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be as widespread an issue I also</font>

373
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,510
think it gives them<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to</font>

374
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,980
acquiesce in the diplomatic space on

375
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,960
some issues and that's one area where

376
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,030
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to diminish their</font>

377
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,440
activity claim to be cracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on</font>

378
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:21,790
others the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

379
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:29,230
know with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese sponsored attacks</font>

380
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:31,880
it again is more strategic more overt

381
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,570
whereas the Russian stuff to me is much

382
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">more mystery even just the attitude that</font>

383
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,100
are out there with the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

384
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,260
into some of the nationalist movement so

385
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,370
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a much more visceral</font>

386
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,200
clandestine feel to it so it's one of

387
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,040
those things I worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more</font>

388
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,240
now and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking with a lot of my</font>

389
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">colleagues both in and out of government</font>

390
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,950
I've been posing this question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

391
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,660
past year and they've all been waiting

392
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:03,860
their concerns over russia is being

393
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:06,859
greater than those that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> China this</font>

394
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,520
is what I could throw out a huge the

395
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,199
loop advocate as you'll see later but I

396
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,629
use this slide actually with a bunch of

397
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,850
Marines a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

398
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,530
resurfaced it's the only non original

399
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:23,179
slide except for the matrix in here oh

400
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,339
and thinking about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that we're</font>

401
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be automating a lot of</font>

402
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,690
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> technologies and that that the</font>

403
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,629
loop loop is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get compressed</font>

404
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,540
pretty significantly it is also going to

405
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,000
have to happen at machine speed right so

406
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,620
I love to see and hear some discussion

407
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we deal with that how</font>

408
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,520
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn over aspects of you know what</font>

409
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,810
kind of national<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense initiatives to</font>

410
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,430
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going to have to</font>

411
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,669
operate within this compressed in the

412
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">loop</font>

413
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,300
this is my yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost posted this to</font>

414
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,340
Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said yes I did do that and</font>

415
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:06,260
uh winter winter is coming I do feel

416
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">like for multiple reasons that you know</font>

417
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,770
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have some critical</font>

418
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,459
infrastructure failures associated with

cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cass I'm not a doomsday scenario</font>

420
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,960
folks where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people laugh</font>

421
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout this earlier I don't believe</font>

422
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,240
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach the state where</font>

423
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,680
it's going to be such a catastrophic

424
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,170
failure that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be eating</font>

425
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,760
our neighbors children but I do feel

426
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,530
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fairly disruptive</font>

427
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,900
one for multiple reasons there's so many

428
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,280
entities playing around and critical

429
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,650

<font color="#CCCCCC">just could be some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Burton failure right</font>

431
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,360
I call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the equivalent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

will allegedly type the great works of

434
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,959
Shakespeare over time but I just based

435
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,270
on the randomness of sequence as well a

438
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,520
something that causes some sort of

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,430
cascading failure that were not prepared

440
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,470
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other aspect of this is I think</font>

441
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,510
that because we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attention now</font>

442
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,640
of these political leaders and they've

443
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,650
seen and we've had Stuxnet and we've

444
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,390
seen it attacks like that I think it's

445
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to be too attractive not to</font>

446
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,220
try it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's that huge appeal of</font>

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,520
being able to wait that fourth even if

448
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,830
it's just a microwave at first says

449
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,600
conflict in cyberspace is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

become too appealing where you're going

451
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,530
to have entities that are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,370
hasn't been working out well for folks

456
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,050
recently but I do feel that we will see

457
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:36,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of isolated infrastructure</font>

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:43,909
here in the next you know it's called

460

the next five years this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one</font>

465
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:37,840
kind of a much more us Western centric

467

out there and we have capabilities that

<font color="#E5E5E5">exists I think that we just don't</font>

should we get bogged<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and what's</font>

that or we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about them well if</font>

472
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,750
they were getting utilized I think we'd

473
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,660
see it a lot less bad things happening

474
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,460
out there today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's one</font>

00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,559
area where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had love to see a</font>

480
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,070
then we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing bad things and</font>

481
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,419
can we declare or something where it's

you know the thing has been taken down

and piracy situations and things of that

sort that you know it can equally apply

491
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,860
in the cyber domain we just haven't had

<font color="#E5E5E5">a real active debate about that gifts</font>

takes our space disappoint

495
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,850
I think you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are indicators if</font>

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,590
you talk with any of the and IM take a

497
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,110
very us centric approach because it came

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with us companies the carriers</font>

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,690
you could even associate with particular

505
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,700
actors so you knew what they're trying

506
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,740
to do what they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that</font>

513
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,370
somebody can in the cyber domain go and

514
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,139
check out the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control not</font>

sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe recapture that command and</font>

516
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,130
control infrastructure yes it might be

517
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,690
owned by a private entity in an

518
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,270
international area we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing</font>

519
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,309
to accept it others might do that to us

520
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,418
if that infrastructure gets stood up in

521
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,860
our space but you don't try<font color="#CCCCCC"> an arm if</font>

522
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,960
it's me if it's owned by another entity

523
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,540
known as or a bullet for hosting

524
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,549

525
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,928
regards to not impacting that box but

526
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already being used for purposes</font>

527
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,850
that are outside the original owners

528
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,919
attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so so you mentioned you</font>

529
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,100
have to be careful a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

530
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,260
to do that box oh then I think that's

531
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,379
part of the part of the problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

532
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,240
debate you know the concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

533
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,970
there's always a law that is going to

534
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,390
stop you from from being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend</font>

535
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself we'll talk will not mad at this</font>

536
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,419
afternoon great but I think that's one

537
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,639
in here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the real concern exists</font>

538
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,740
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always those the problems of</font>

539
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,980
government sure Bob and I don't think

540
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:45,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this needs to be in my opinion a</font>

541
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,860
government activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm not as I'm</font>

542
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">not saying we need to commercialize this</font>

543
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,129
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> their companies need to be defending</font>

544
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,100
themselves I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to address it</font>

545
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,980
at the gumby level yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spark pretty</font>

546
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,740
much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just a fancy just had a</font>

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,890
thought Barrineau gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer</font>

perfect

550
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:08,489
and here's the Geneva Accords the

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,279
inherent<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to self-defense if</font>

552
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,690
there's no cactus<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling for so</font>

553
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,029
egregious repealing such a level

554
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,769
intellectual property is that

555
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:19,649
corporation act retarded by hiring a

556
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:21,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">hitman to go slack somebody that might</font>

557
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,279
actually reportable because it was the

558
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:26,489
continued existence of that corporation

559
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,799
of that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was at risk and they</font>

560
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:33,210
responded in a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve their</font>

561
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:35,729
continued existence with respect to

562
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,590
everybody this is the topic when it's

563
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:41,279
beer o'clock and to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the schedule</font>

564
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:46,168
yeah this is the this<font color="#CCCCCC"> afternoon we get</font>

565
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:49,349
to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this mess and all the</font>

566
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:51,269
full spectrum of yeah that's why we're

567
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:53,729
doing it is a debate that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to</font>

568
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:57,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">see I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just below</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys yeah yeah</font>

569
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:59,009
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> endeavor I think these slides</font>

570
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,119
are kind of the things I'm hoping that

571
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to talk about and be</font>

572
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,709
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least coming out of</font>

573
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:09,359
this so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hit on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

574
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,529
a couple of touch points and this one I

575
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,699
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't resist because it's in</font>

576
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,529
from work on and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

577
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:19,019
about UFOs and all sorts of other fun

578
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:20,970
stuff as well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about information</font>

579
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">overload and you know the kind of the</font>

580
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,039
future shock and the kids the being

581
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,330
attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their phones we haven't seen</font>

582
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,830
anything yet I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no if you're</font>

583
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,689
following what's happening with the

584
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,830
augmented reality and virtual reality

585
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,299
and all that sort of stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

586
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next ten years are going to be</font>

587
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:39,509
massive technological advancements

588
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:41,849
they're going to be very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

589
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,529
watch and then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide just to</font>

590
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:47,009
prove that I'm not always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pessimist</font>

591
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:49,200
you know I am encouraged by some of the

592
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are being invested in on the</font>

593
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,139
defense side of the equation as well

594
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,970
right not that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

595
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:55,738
any near-term value them again when you

596
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,599
start to look at three to five years out

597
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:59,340
there's some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing that</font>

598
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,019
are being gone with behavioral analytics

599
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,178
and machine learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forming</font>

00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,429
technology AI<font color="#E5E5E5"> since that sort so there</font>

601
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,499
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be the the</font>

603
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,649
myself being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a were there at the</font>

604
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,239
atlantic council where I was the only

605
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,768
optimist around the table because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

606
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,740
really do feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be empowered</font>

607
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:17,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make things better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over time</font>

608
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,280
just going to take some work to get

609
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:26,970
there that's all I have but yes does

610
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,160
anybody think of all of these and cyber

611
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,730
things as being part of the greater

612
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,390
strategy or because Oliver has been

613
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,990
cyber cyber sake yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> as anybody he's</font>

614
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought of combining it with other means</font>

615
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:44,190
there's been discussions about that and

616
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,260
that was kind of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key things</font>

617
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we looked at the the Chairman</font>

618
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,440
strategy obviously there was a cyber

619
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,360
components there's some integration

620
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,490
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in error but does this IRA</font>

621
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,559
strategy for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. need to be a</font>

622
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,210
standalone cyber strategy it should be

623
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,399
should it be integrated as a part of a

624
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,030
larger grand strategy right I think we

625
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,170
do grand strategy very poorly right now

626
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">amar that might be because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

627
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,820
intentionally you know break things into

628
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,699
chunks that might maybe should be

629
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrated together so for so if anyone</font>

630
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants it off you guys me I've got a</font>

631
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:20,370
degree for me to decide minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

632
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:24,389
Jordan<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss this consumer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's of</font>

633
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:26,550
you students for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yes without getting</font>

634
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,330
a painting class<font color="#E5E5E5"> faggot like that I</font>

635
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:34,830
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my girl we mentioned that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

636
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:41,909
was more dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> China yeah elaborate</font>

637
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:44,820
on yeah i think if<font color="#CCCCCC"> faria</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a there's</font>

638
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:48,780
obviously great capability there again

639
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,850
they they're much more kind of a mirror

640
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,470
image you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome with regards</font>

641
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,740
to cyber operations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's much</font>

642
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:58,260
more clandestine classified obviously

643
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,450
the the integration kind of corruption

644
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,129
issues that they have not only the

645
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,410
nation-state but within the security

646
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,140
apparatus is a huge concern but then the

647
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,580
other metric there for me is it real

648
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,980
touch points just studying the

649
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,129
resurgence that kind of the nationalist

650
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,990
movement there where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really being</font>

651
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,880
demonized and joel i hope you'll speak

652
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,500
to this today it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons i</font>

653
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,059
put it in there from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a psy ops</font>

654
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,980
perspective they're running a very

655
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:25,530
effective psy ops campaign against their

656
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,940
internal population and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

657
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,360
that I was watching or are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

658
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,150
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> motion over China Russia okay yeah</font>

659
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font>

660
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,039
honestly what you just said you can you

661
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:38,390
can swab yeah but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font>

662
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,549
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk about this this</font>

663
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,760
afternoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheriff I stuff that I see on</font>

664
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:47,059
the China side is again not as visceral

665
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,830
not as kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of warmongering as you</font>

666
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing the rush decided and it's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area</font>

667
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've been tracking it really struck home</font>

668
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,949
for me a few months ago I have a person

669
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,570
I went to college<font color="#E5E5E5"> with here in the</font>

670
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,980
United States he's Russian who have

671
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,870
interacted with and maintained

672
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,020
connectivity over email and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and</font>

673
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">he came online on Facebook one night and</font>

674
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,309
said you know do you agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

675
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,549
sanctions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Obama administration</font>

676
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:12,440
has instituted and I was like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

677
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,760
why are we having this discussion you

678
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,220
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are you how are the kids</font>

679
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,610
type stuff and he's like these are

680
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,260
criminal sanctions and you've declared

681
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,330
war on my children's and now i'm

682
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,158
declaring war on your children<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

683
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,809
said my children will be stronger than

684
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,730
your children because yours are being

685
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,010
raised by homosexual couples and mine

686
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,659
are being raised by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rihanna and just</font>

687
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,899
went on to be engaged and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at it</font>

688
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:37,669
so you know if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says you</font>

689
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know Western educated lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Western</font>

690
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,190
friends is now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on facebook</font>

691
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">and start attacking people verbally</font>

692
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,220
based on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this activity there's</font>

693
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,080
got to be something much deeper and this

694
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,520
is your area of expertise more than mine

695
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,520
but it certainly has struck me that

696
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,710
there's a kind of reinforcing much more

697
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,720
you know demonizing factor that exists

698
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,399
there if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could touching this for just</font>

699
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,409
a second and I'm all talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

700
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,350
during like my my priests in taking

701
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:06,380
tomorrow one of my jaws was going to

702
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:11,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">China and talking about cyber warfare</font>

703
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:14,510
and it struck me when I'm sitting there

704
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:17,870
and so I talked to them about Chinese

705
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:20,809
capabilities in cyber war and I I said

706
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:23,570
you know I said you guys hacked wii hack

707
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:26,600
we break any or systems of you break

708
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,960
into our systems we spy on you and you

709
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,449
spy on us but and and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

710
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">told the Chinese seniors I said you</font>

711
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:39,000
don't scare me as much as as Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> tubs</font>

712
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,650
because you get caught all the time and

713
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,510
as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they don't mind getting</font>

714

caught anyway that's and since then

715
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,040
though I've amended that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

716
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:50,280
because I in my mind I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,260
three stages of hackers there's uh the

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,680
script kiddies that take the win and

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">they make a lot of noise and they</font>

720
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,760
changings and they get caught then you

721
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,980
got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are pretty good and</font>

722
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,879
they get in there and they can make a

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,770
coat and fly and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the ones that</font>

724
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,780
we mostly worried about then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the</font>

you can you say about certain things

keep the conversation discourse clear
