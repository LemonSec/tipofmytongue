3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:34,079
because he's next on the agenda Oh more

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,510
slides yeah where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,780
left your last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll give it</font>

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:53,339
back to you keep its efficient he's

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:56,940
providing all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence I've</font>

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,660

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,660
Lars and I've been coming to some

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,488
different conclusions this is sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,950
take of the way the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> is real quick</font>

12
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,650
it's broken the security approaches that

13
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,450
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing are fundamentally wrong</font>

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,979
otherwise we wouldn't be here and we'd

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,110
be out surfing instead of having these

16
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:20,789
kind of discussions and I'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

17
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,390
look at things from an analog standpoint

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot more a couple problems that we've</font>

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,170
got obviously digital is not binary and

20
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,750
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get into some of them thinking</font>

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,579
behind this the purpose of this talk is

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,250
not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to convince anybody that I'm</font>

23
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,869
right about what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say the</font>

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,659
purpose is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been thinking</font>

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,579
about stuff very<font color="#E5E5E5"> differently and if i</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you guys are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking with a</font>

27
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,740
slightly different perspective maybe we

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,470
can start coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with different</font>

29
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,939
answers than what we have traditionally

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,500
been doing a political assessments<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

31
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,270
just over in holland doing this and

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,140
stuff for some of them those those guys

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,920
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nato and there's a huge disconnect</font>

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,719
between the concepts of what we were

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about technically and this</font>

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,730
digital mindset that also falls into the

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,950
legislative process in every country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,690
something we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat everything is</font>

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,660
a very very binary function and I want

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,150
to fight do that so this was me young<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,548
differently and the Air Force<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted me</font>

to sit the ass end of a b-52 as I can

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,810

conditions which<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,560
interesting I grew up in complex systems

58
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,959
but they ran out of let's analog systems

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,239
recording studios broadcast facilities

60
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,640
lots of live recording where the word no

61
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,340
failure was not an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have</font>

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,150
everything breaks the show still has to

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,100
go on how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that and this was</font>

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,920
part of also<font color="#E5E5E5"> what helps me with incident</font>

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,930
response in that there unless you've got

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">your plans unless things are in order</font>

68
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,079
and you've got some advanced thought in

69
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,060
the analog domain in the spectrum and

70
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:43,079
we'll get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will find</font>

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,609
failure a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier so analog what is</font>

72
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,780
analog in this group you're going to

73
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,269
know but a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group's I talked</font>

74
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">to they really don't understand all I</font>

75
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,280
mean by it is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

76
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:57,900
continuously<font color="#E5E5E5"> variable instead of this</font>

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,459
absolute<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 continuously variable as all</font>

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,709
that it is when people look at square

79
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,889
waves over here they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to view those</font>

80
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,859
as digital however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really zoom</font>

81
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:11,160
in on it take a little bit fractal view

82
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,970
a square wave is really an analog

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,339
function that is being approximated as a

84
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,789
square wave it's not absolutely a

85
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,150
digital square wave you do lots of

86
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:26,159
averaging we are an averaging machine

87
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,880
computers are digital processor this is

88
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,130
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

89
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,690
bridging machine and we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,870
get these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

91
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,580
and averaging is just normal part of how

92
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,640
we're doing digital music these days

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:43,169
it's all done with averaging into an

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:46,020
analog domain from digital signals you

95
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,670
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think more in a continuous I in</font>

96
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,430
the military we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we</font>

97
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,060
get from peacetime to wartime<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,370
stuff in the middle but typically in the

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">world that we live in insecurity it's an</font>

100

either/or condition we have Asperger's

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,590
and autism it's not an absolute it's a

102
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:08,130
spectrum of various levels of intensity

103
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,560
same thing with volume volume Sam it's

104
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,900
an analog function<font color="#E5E5E5"> d see the light</font>

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,000
electromagnetic spectrum it's not

106
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,130
discreet it's a completely analog

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,690
function and this is part of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

108
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,850
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get across the people and</font>

109

hopefully ill or looks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

110
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to get you to think that way</font>

111
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:30,810
turn off absolutism and the phrase I use

112
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:33,859
is I absolutely hate absolutism and it's

113
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:37,920
a recursive convoluted way of thinking

114
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,510
it's a we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking at these</font>

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,150
problems very very differently than what

116
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,880
we currently are I also grew up with a

117
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,099
thing called synesthesia I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

118
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,450
the record business and when I was

119
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,170
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guitar is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the studio</font>

120
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is what I see in my head when I</font>

121
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,850
hear music and it's much less pronounced

122
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,830
now than it was back when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was in the</font>

123
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">music business but again it was a</font>

124
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:08,099
complete analog in this case between

125
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:11,430
what I heard and what I saw so the

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet what he was a smidgen I think</font>

127
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the scale we've got its really</font>

128
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,550
analog right now the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

129
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,520
perimeter ization is taking away the

130
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,860
concept of absolute end points multiple

131
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,099
devices for five eight 10 however many

132
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,580
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this has become a blob an 8th</font>

dimensions sometimes in four dimensions

136
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,740
we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it from an</font>

137
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,699
absolute digital perspective

138
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,160
if we pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> back our view pull back the</font>

139
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,229
view and look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole as an analog</font>

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,720
function instead of a very specific end

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,960
point at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all times but we need both</font>

142
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,470
views just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like quantum mechanics wave</font>

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,180
particle duality both are valid

144
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,009
depending upon what you're trying to

145
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,580
achieve you and the level of granularity

152
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,859
to kind of have some ideas now how it

153
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,340
works but as we get more integration

154

going on between us and systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> orica</font>

167
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,120
what we've been doing and right now I

tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the argument we are tcp/ip</font>

172
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,559
we're going to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 billion more</font>

173

things to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know is</font>

siege warfare mindset imagine a line

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,850
that worked quite clearly oh the great

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,839
how because the military was some of the

184
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,930
first guys thinking about this back in

185

<font color="#CCCCCC">the old days l date me in the 70s this</font>

186
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,689
was the approach that was use Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

187
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,230
we took the approach of fortress

188
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:18,569
mentality let's keep the bad guys out so

189
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,230
we had gates we had guards with dogs and

190
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:24,209
we had an asynchronous computer sitting

191
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,509
off in a room and then a green screen

192
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,888
and that was our security model and the

193
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,360
security model that we used was

194
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,670
fundamentally the reference monitor

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,680
Bella<font color="#CCCCCC"> padulla version and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the bidi</font>

196
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,849
integrity model that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

197
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,949
very similar very simple kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of process</font>

198
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,779
make a decision whole processing make a

199
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:45,899
decision based upon some set of rules

200
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,639
and have a go<font color="#CCCCCC"> no-go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> condition in an</font>

201
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,089
asynchronous world from a single

202
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:55,019
processor back in the 60s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 70s this</font>

203
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,600
made sense like broke everything was the

204
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,899
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of citrus communications visa V</font>

205
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,170
the network things completely collapse

206
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,199
at that point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in the mid-90s</font>

207
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,370
somebody mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> DISA so people</font>

208
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:13,529
remember Bobby ayres from decision he

209
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,319
and I had a meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some crazy</font>

210
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:19,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Polish people in Warsaw they never</font>

211
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:22,139
showed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what'd you guys do drink</font>

212
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,209
beer and bring out a napkin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bob</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

213
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,329
working on concept inside of difficult

214
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,949
protect detect respond and that is what

215
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of mantras are now being used</font>

216
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,599
today with the product vendors we detect

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,240
and respond and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are full</font>

218
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:43,050
crap it's just saying everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hurts</font>

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,649
what so the question comes down is this

220
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,199
vault secure is a safe secure and in the

221
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:52,319
physical world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a way of</font>

222
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,209
measuring and understanding how secure

223
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,370
it is again not a binary function

224
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,969
because we cannot say that that is

225
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,180
absolutely secure because their ratings

226
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,889
and those ratings are based upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

227
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,279
temperature intent and there's various

228
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:09,339
other physical fact

229
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be measured and we get some</font>

230
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:14,170
idea of the amount of protection or the

231
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of retention that the day in this</font>

232
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,089
case the physical device actually has it

233
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,999
gives a reference point and generally it

234
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:27,850
comes down to time in our world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

235
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:31,149
have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> option right now to get any</font>

236
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,209
any vendor ever guarantee how long his

238
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:41,378
any any guarantees in our field from

239
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:44,859
anybody no<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely not so I started</font>

240
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:48,550
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time as being a metric so</font>

241
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,589
this firewall how secure is this this

242
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,589
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> from anyone's Dave it's from York</font>

243
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,600
and it's a binary function of a had

244
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,339
every intention of putting them back

245
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,069
just like any change in any security

246
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,939
system so how are you how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we rate</font>

you mean prevention you know I'm

miserable and provable but we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

314

cannot do that so what we end up with is

an exposure issue and this goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

322
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,589
but we knew how to detect reaction gave

323
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,989
us a window and then the protection

324
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:55,550
became an open question of exposure

325
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:58,569
which is what mad was all about so many

326

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,790
the only thing that shows is that we do

something automated it's gonna be a lot

343

349
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:56,209
the organization gets more because file

350
00:16:53,899 --> 00:17:00,110
size and bandwidth are all dividable by

351
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:01,579
time as a common metric so what we end

352
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,800
up with is since we don't know

of additional layers of security based

upon file size again in

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,990

simply and / time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to understand</font>

where certain levels of vulnerability

arc and in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing</font>

418
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,410
simple math on what happens when I

419
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,550
compress from a gigabyte per second to

420
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,990
100 Meg per second do I need that speed

421
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:23,500
for everything i'm doing do i need that

422
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,900
speed to stay in business E or will

423
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,150
reduce speed be acceptable while i'm

424
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,470
doing mitigation so bandwidth

425
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,570
compression is something that I'm

426
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,000
suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> we begin to look at to</font>

427

<font color="#E5E5E5">already seeing adversaries doing things</font>

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,940
like compressing definitely moving to

429
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,290
higher bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> exfiltration points and</font>

430
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,660
playing with windows of exfiltration

431
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,980
when more bands available yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so</font>

432
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,570
clearly one of the fact that the

433
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,550
industry is already compensating for

434
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,520
that well you can't compensate cannot

435
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,409
take if you can present<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mergers that</font>

436

if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> my internal network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

438
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,399

441
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,280
not going to speed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> data because</font>

442
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,080
they've not unless they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of</font>

443
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,910
your bandwidth compression internally

444
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,939
and that's where the defense of death

445
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,100
comes back into deal in the deal under a

446
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,350
detection reaction mechanism because the

447
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,830
bandwidth compressor would be in that

448
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,830
Mexico circle I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree the</font>

Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate so you go on and right</font>

451
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,750
now Cybercom claims that they're not

452
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,490
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> unplug servers when their</font>

453
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,400
attack they're going to continue through

454
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,010
the attack the challenge that is that

455
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,170
they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a compression but</font>

456
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice edge</font>

457
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:52,030
where what happens is is that they can

458
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,370
slowly attack a little bit but that

459
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives them a false sense of the</font>

460
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,889
impression that they have time to now

461
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,230
mitigate the problem and this comes down

462
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,720
to education and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things which they</font>

463
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,880
simply are not doing and that becomes an

464
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,980
issue the other issue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when they</font>

465
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,510
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the compression piece of it they</font>

466
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,530
start to just basically kick out

467
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,450
programs

468
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,879
and they'll say okay no more streaming

469
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:20,170
video and they'll kill it guess what a

470

Predator is oops I'm not again<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I</font>

471
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,500
fully agree with you it's how you view

472
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,000
the world with a different prison now

473
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,670
launched and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jessica's I go through this</font>

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,900
as we use an analog prism and some of

475
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,610
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said they're still</font>

responding with a digital response

477
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,860
correct and the leadership above doesn't

understand what you just said increase

479
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,760
life they don't get that so that's all

480
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,760
they're trying but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your job now</font>

481
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so with that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning</font>

482
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,909
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the work of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the haters and</font>

483
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,040
everybody had one of the things that

really really really pisses<font color="#CCCCCC"> me off is</font>

485
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,750
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> still have fruit we still have</font>

486
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,090
woot control curl of systems and I

487
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">started thinking about it and why after</font>

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:19,449
50 60 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we still have this and</font>

489
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,890
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around it sorry well we're</font>

without killing bippy we're going to get

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:32,290
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world works is we</font>

494
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:34,420
have binary trust I trust the guy I

495
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,200
don't trust their he's a trusted insider

496
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,720
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> y'all tell me this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way we</font>

497
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,520
do it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now except it gets much</font>

498
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,940
worse than this because we don't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

499
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,010
it as an analog function we wrap booths

500
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:57,790
are great people yes or no<font color="#CCCCCC"> we give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

501
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:00,100
the keys to the kingdom or we don't but

502
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we don't do is do an appropriate level</font>

503
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,750
of vetting and waiting and understanding

504
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,470
something we don't use called trust

505
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,360
factor which should sit min max now I

506
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,510
grew up analog and we had recording

507
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,010
consoles we have an equalizer and what

508
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,200
we would do in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's</font>

509
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,060
tough work is twist it all the way down

510
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,550
all the way up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then another up all</font>

511
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way down all the way up to</font>

512
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,419
understand what happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

513
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,040
particular

514
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:31,300
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that in our environment</font>

515
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,250
because we have this binary switch so we

516
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,659
need to start looking at it as an analog

517
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,730
function with trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to</font>

518
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">end up meaning something in a couple of</font>

519
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides so the real world though when we</font>

520
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,430
get somebody would control we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give</font>

521
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,419
one guy with control because he can't be

522
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:51,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there 24 7 365 so we have five guys</font>

523
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:55,440
route control some number and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

524
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:59,050
gives us is a logical bullion or gate

525
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:04,290
meaning Bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue any of them can get on</font>

526
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:07,180
there and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the changes as it admin</font>

527
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:09,550
enterprise really some number of people

528
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,740
and we have an or function but what ends

529
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,290
up happening when you apply trust factor

530
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,910
and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay at this first</font>

531
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,600
admin we're going to trust him point

532
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:25,210
nine but the second admin what do we

533
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,189
trust him point five in this case we can

534
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:31,090
show and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> probabilistic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matt</font>

535
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,090
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really complex that now my</font>

536
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:37,689
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> my trust is lower than the</font>

537
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,699
weakest link which changes our entire

538
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,320
perception of how we're looking at trust

539
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,820
now this doesn't solve anything yet

540
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,810
again it's a different way of looking at

541
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,129
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> now how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we solve this well we</font>

542
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,820
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called the two-man</font>

543
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,520
rule the question is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put that level</font>

544
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,870
of trust how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that number that</font>

545
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,510
is going to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that is</font>

546
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,699
self-consistent within at the specific

organization York receta criteria is

548
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,380
going to be different than Lars is going

549
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,250
to be different than his say you know

550
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,170
not even more the vendor that had snow

551
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,440
down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were a thousand admins</font>

552
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,660
on there and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you rate Snowden you</font>

553
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,400
know a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for versus someone else or</font>

554
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,050
not it has to be an internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of</font>

555
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,410
criteria with your own waiting but

556
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,180
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up a store not it</font>

557
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,820
he's on the results mouse wait what

558
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:35,170
would you say Tom Snyder out Satan copy

world same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question different way to</font>

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,560
resolve the answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again i'm not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">saying I've got telling you how to</font>

565
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,980
resolve the answers I'm looking at an

566
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,169
approach to look at the problem

567
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,990
differently and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do that</font>

568
00:26:53,170 --> 00:27:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's life if am I suggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

569
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:02,350
bottom line here the total total trust

570
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,620
factor should probably be an average in

571
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:10,870
that multiplication so I'm saying point

572
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine plus point 5/2 I will go over that</font>

573
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,959
later I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to let's not get that</font>

574
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,219
granular but let's go do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could have</font>

575
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,550
been playing with this for a while but

576
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,430
i'll show you the logic behind it later

577
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:23,500
so the two-man rule we were used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

578
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:27,040

the two-man rule in our networks well

582
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:39,129
that creates an and gate very very

admin time who said time that's it

586
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,040
because this guy may make a change or

587
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,240
affect something but we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for</font>

what the application is I have a time

problem so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I get around that I</font>

594
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:17,190
grew up again analog and the concept of

feedback we're all used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buda and</font>

596
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,790
that's essentially a dynamic feedback

602
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,430
improvement and a lot of this is what

the line as well now in feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

629
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,220
stuff yesterday you heard the feedback

630
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,490
from here in Morocco and that's an

631
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,130
acoustic mechanism all amplification

632
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,130
circuits are based upon feedback and

633
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:00,820
then the abstraction model is here what

634
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:03,450
this does for fundamental reason for

635
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,600
feedback in any of these environments is

636
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:09,820
to create a sense of equilibrium to keep

637
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,129
things from getting out of control a

638
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,550
runaway condition whether it's in the

639
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:19,180
physical electrical or acoustic criteria

640
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:23,800
in our world we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

641
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,810
feedback going on so we know that

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,629
haptics we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning it's all</font>

643
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:32,050
feedback face completely because we are

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:34,270
feedback face that wave<font color="#CCCCCC"> brains work in</font>

645

the Neuros neurons are working it's not

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,510
digital memory it's a constant feedback

647

loop continuously learning and changing

648
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:47,590

652
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,399
here is that there is some process some

<font color="#CCCCCC">requests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something is going to happen so</font>

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,040
that request goes through but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

655
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,680
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the two-man rule it has to</font>

medicated within some specified amount

658
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,820
of time and the second trigger is a

659
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:16,070
decrementing clock based upon policy if

we see the failure in legislation we see

the failure in so many places in the

all you EES John it's called an rs

688
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:35,360
flip-flop what it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is a bit of</font>

689
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,840
memory it's simple diode logic and what

690
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,659
happens is when I do a set I go hi do a

691
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,300
reset I go low and it's just the inverse

692
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:49,040
functions so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a memory circuit of</font>

one bit of information this is how we're

this up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and look at this</font>

slightly differently than I currently do

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,200
and I'm arguably calling it a try<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

gate for now hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> cope something</font>

709
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,250
better than that but logically it ends

up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very interesting</font>

except for quantum entanglement what

policy-driven amount of analog time it's

725
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:21,889
a time window again a min<font color="#E5E5E5"> max condition</font>

726
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:24,139
so now let's take one more thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

727
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,549
grew up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and I showed you the</font>

728
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,839
circuit earlier with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume control</font>

729
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a potentiometer and the</font>

730
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,190
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop of an amplification</font>

731
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:34,100
circuit in order to maintain equilibrium

732
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,380
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough as we started going into</font>

733
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,960
automation in the audio industry in the

734
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,920
seventies and how i met the blonde lady

735
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,600
ins call operating all this we

736
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,750
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we're going to run a computer</font>

737
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,460
for audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop cool so in order to do</font>

738
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,580
that we had to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an out-of-band</font>

739
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,560
condition normally you have the audio

740
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volume control to control in one</font>

741
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,850
circuit similar to the way we're running

742
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:03,950
tcp/ip right now we have data and

743
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,810
control down the same hunk of wire which

744
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,939
is really good with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attack of</font>

745
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,370
course so what was done in the audio

746
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,280
industry is to set an external voltage

747
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,259
control over the amplification in the

748
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,910
center control circuit if something goes

749
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,000
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the control circuit was fine</font>

750
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:23,390
the volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> would remain the same no</font>

751
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,730
major impact how much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this are we</font>

752
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,319
doing in our world right now we're not

753
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of outer band</font>

754
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,780
communications whatsoever so in a hike

755
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,680
surveys network which is where i grew up

756
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:41,040
we had audio sensors and control sensors

757
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,990
everywhere in these control consoles and

758
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,140
the communication between them and the

759
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,500
tape machines all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bits and pieces we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in our world here so</font>

761
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,440
another way of looking at this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

762
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">one we talked earlier you have to have a</font>

765
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,609
when something goes wrong what should

766
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,410
the response be and we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> all said in</font>

met we gotta cook all the CIO and then

770
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,050
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call the lawyer then we gotta</font>

771
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,150
go call the police in order to figure

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what we're going to end time time</font>

773
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:21,270

774

versus having some<font color="#E5E5E5"> prescribed set of</font>

775
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,910
criteria that are somewhat predictable

776
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,730
as good as mat with saying and have some

777
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,339
sort of initial response whether it's

778
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:35,700
time compression shut it off what is the

779
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:37,589
response going to be so we can have

780
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,450
single reaction channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the point</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that that reaction matrix in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in in an external out-of-band</font>

791
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:08,279
external to the conventional control and

792
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,079
information circuits we have additional

793
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,200
capabilities depending upon the night

794
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,690
nature of attack so in this one I have

795

two reaction channels one running

796
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,260
perimeter stuff one running internal

797
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,599
stuff and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a feedback</font>

801
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:33,390
in a dynamic mechanism and those

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the out of damn thing that's your job</font>

869
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,820
yeah that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job well after</font>

870
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:39,850
everybody's playing nice and property

871
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,370
well yeah again it's a protocol if the

872
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,080
protocol is the presumption of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

873
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:49,569
protocol and outer band communications

874
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:51,850
is correct and arguably from up highest

875
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,140
level abstraction level it is get

876
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody to play somebody's going to</font>

877
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:58,569
productize this I need say there are you

878
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,430
surprised to have been doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

879
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">world right now if you've heard then</font>

880
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,270
bring it on we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that let me</font>

881
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,870
just you finish this up with negative

882
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:11,200
time right now what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

883
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">often is we'll have our I ugh data</font>

884
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,230
traffic and then we've got our IDs and

885
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:19,200
then we have our big data so now we're

886
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,850
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> study all of this big data oh</font>

887
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,399
 that's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on but it's</font>

888
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:30,040
still going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm reacting after</font>

889
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:33,460
the fact does everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to happen</font>

890
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:37,990
close to instantly there are many cases

891
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:39,940
when the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is absolutely no so if I</font>

892
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,740
know that my detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> and reaction and</font>

893
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,640
in this case you call it on IBS on a big

894
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,790
data analyzer for example in a malware

895
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,129
environment why does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that traffic have</font>

896
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:54,700
to go ahead of the decision being made

897
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:57,460
by the big data why don't we do what we

898
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:01,330
did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audio business delay it a</font>

899
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:04,150
little bit does everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go up</font>

900
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:07,990
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it being set up have</font>

901
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,150
to go out that vary by per second or is

902
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,250
a hundred milliseconds later after

903
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,500
analysis acceptable

904
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:19,810
who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know the difference point</font>

905
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:23,830
is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take some delay / whatever</font>

906
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:27,850
traffic I choose and I delay it the

907
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:31,210
exact amount plus some nominal constant

908
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:33,400
of my detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> and reaction time that's</font>

909
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,030
measurable I go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my original</font>

910
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,120
formula and I now know with my delay

911
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:42,130
that my protection time is greater than

912
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,920
my 'both might sorry my protection kind

913
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:48,220
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> now greater than my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detection and</font>

914
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:51,640
reaction time giving me in theory if

915
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:55,419
John's able to build this provable

916
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:58,720
security that's the concepts I've been

917
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,370
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with for a while what else going</font>

918
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,810
to do every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talk to people they</font>

919
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,819
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that idea and do</font>

920
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,910
this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that idea and do this and</font>

921
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exciting part for me that I</font>

922
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,390
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of got some ideas and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

923
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,450
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab on I'm looking for</font>

924
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:15,490
holes in it and the fundamental thing

925
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get across is these have</font>

926
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:21,100
become my new mantras new ways of

927
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,170
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and slides will be available to</font>

928
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,210
everybody of course and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tend to be</font>

929
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,460
analog and what has happened for me

930
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,430
nothing else when somebody talks

931
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:34,210
security I'm no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer thinking of these</font>

932
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:37,240
absolute ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros everything has</font>

933
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:39,400
become a continuum for me and that whole

934
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,000
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lawyer question gotcha well just</font>

935
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,960
a yes or a no sir well tends to be

936
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,450
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in geek world well it depends</font>

937
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it depends is an analog answer not</font>

938
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,279
a digital answer and I'm hoping that to

939
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,600
get people to start thinking with a

940
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,240
different viewpoint and with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

941
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,940
different filter so analog network

942
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,919
security com where Haley is here going

943
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing wonderful things with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

944
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,910
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hopefully just a different</font>

945
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">way of thinking so thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much I</font>

946
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,410
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i love to confuse faces</font>

947
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:23,069
that means a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> aving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making you</font>

948
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">think and a joke let's say it works</font>

949
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:34,700
um how high level can this be applied I

950
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:36,890
look at the to get min max at the coast

951
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,529
level I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a little bit of code</font>

952
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,270
with I'm no coder but I've been there

953
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,760
are some programs out there from purview

954
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,070
actually that allowed me to put in logic

955
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,470
tables draw them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out Hammond code is</font>

956
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,930
generated so I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from the code</font>

957
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:56,419
level and then ultimately the other

958
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:59,450
extreme is that the tier 1 guys again

959
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:02,030
it's an abstraction concept not a

960
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:06,109
product it's just a different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

961
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:10,130
looking at the universe has has Bertha

962
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:15,310
seen this I don't know I mean I've only

963
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,310
started presenting this three weeks ago

964
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:20,390
at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate thank you let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fast</font>

965
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:21,980
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we're going to hand</font>

966
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,098
everything over to Sweden for a couple

967
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,099
hours
