1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,360
first off just like to start out by

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,250
saying is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first conference</font>

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:25,380
and my first presentation ever so thank

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:28,470
you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much win and so so let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,410
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hitting back at people this</font>

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,040
is a fringe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Empire of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mimetic</font>

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,040
warfare and international strategy what

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,050
if i can offer you all a way to

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,839
infiltrate your targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-making</font>

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,599
process and make them do what you want

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,050
them to do what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,820
method to alter their thought processes

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,069
so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change their</font>

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,000
perceptions and have them make the

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,149
decisions you want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make what if</font>

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power to place your</font>

17
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,710
thoughts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minds of their leaders</font>

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,810
to make their teachers teach the true

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,419
version of history to make their

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,400
soldiers attack on your command to be

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere at once more powerful than it</font>

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,610
whisper<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's a line from Kingdom</font>

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,920
of the Crystal Skull but the idea is

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:26,159
actually possible but but first let's

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,420
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how things are today the US</font>

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,659
has had more than a quarter million

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,150
casualties that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> death</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and wounded by</font>

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:40,820
DoD and VA numbers in Vietnam Iraq and

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,820
Afghanistan so what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get for those</font>

30
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm not happy and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a valid</font>

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,110
tribute for the brave men and women who

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,820
went over there to do what needed to be

33
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:05,810
done so how did this happen well we're

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,130
not thinking in fully integrated methods

35
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,960
and then contrast<font color="#E5E5E5"> their adversaries are</font>

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,450
we just heard today about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a great</font>

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,480
jobs the Russians are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing new frame</font>

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,579
they shot out a civilian airliner and

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,329
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow make it seem like</font>

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoa we had a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons for it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought it was a legitimate target and</font>

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,320
it was an assassination attempt on Putin

43
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,380
and it totally wasn't our fault and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it worked next question look</font>

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,459
at China and their cyber action law fair

46
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,380
their diplomatic strategy against India

47
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,570
your area denial attempt and their

48
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,090
general imperialism if they're thinking

49
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:47,340
20 30 40 years out we're thinking about

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,370
Hillary Clinton's election strategy and

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next election cycle it's amazing if</font>

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,580
we're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the next midterm</font>

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:00,420
strap so in terms of how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think need</font>

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change so let's get a little heavy</font>

55
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,369
here in terms of theory Klaus which

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,980
teaches us that war is merely

57
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:13,860
continuation of politics by other means

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:16,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sunzu teaches us that the tao war is</font>

59
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,030
deception so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this means is</font>

60
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:26,450
that war is a subset of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their vigil more</font>

61
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:32,250
is a subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> of politics but politics is</font>

62
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:34,560
subset of information information in and

63
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,000
of itself that that theory is all born

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,310
out by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aristotle and his people his book</font>

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,370
rhetoric<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the theory that how we</font>

66
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">present information affects the</font>

67
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,620
political outcome of our discussions

68
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,480
Machiavelli what information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I control</font>

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,370
and I share with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you determines how the</font>

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,040
state or the prince and the city-state

71
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,860
survives this is true with burn

72
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,650
days this is true with intelligence

73
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,200
apparatus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd lay dollars to doughnuts</font>

74
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,810
that the many of the cyber experts here

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,238
would agree who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the zero-day</font>

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:20,459
exploits can benefit from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs who can</font>

77
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:22,740
patch them information so therefore who

78
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,199
controls an information environment can

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,600
control or at least influence a

80
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,880
political environment but this begs the

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,729
question what does an information

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,340
environment look one well an information

83
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:40,110
environment my theory is made up of

84
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,698
three major components and for this part

85
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,949
of the theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am indebted to Christine</font>

86
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,130
McNulty so giving credit where credit is

87
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:50,789
due issues brilliant brilliant women<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

88
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:53,130
PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course and her theory comes from</font>

89
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,810
this starts with beliefs values and

90
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,940
motivations and they are the foundation

91
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,250
of society unique culture and

92
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,050
information environment they in<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

93
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:06,810
influence the attitudes and lifestyles

94
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:13,139
of that society those determine your

95
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:15,240
political actions so therefore we can

96
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,210
try to determine your political actions

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,659
too hard pile of horse do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

98
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:25,530
will send literary men or i will send in

99
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:27,090
Jay damn we could try to do it through

100
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,940
influencing your attitudes and

101
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,400
lifestyles do what I want and here's an

102
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:37,770
envelope of cash or here's a Range Rover

103
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,780
or here's luxury housing or we could try

104
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to influence your beliefs values and</font>

105
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:53,429
motivations that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Benz so</font>

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:06:00,258
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean well not a picture of</font>

108
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:08,219

109
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,740
is the foundation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for various socio</font>

110

cultural attitudes communicated amongst

people in society

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,679
now simplified it's basically a unit of

113
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,289
cultural information at its basest form

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,889
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they work well i'm going to call</font>

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the observation or orientation level</font>

137
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,469
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain that in a minute</font>

138
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that comes back to Antonio Gramsci now</font>

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was a communist who sought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is the final revolution going</font>

141
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,550
to come back because Marx's theory of

142
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,409
the dialectic doesn't really explain how

143
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final transformation is going to</font>

144
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:05,199
occur so kids thought was certain

145
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:10,060
classes in any given society are more

146
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:14,550
responsible for the intellectual

147
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:21,610
conceptions that we accept than others

148
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:25,070
so in Western society a massive amount

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,870
thoughts along those lines come out of

164
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,770
different propaganda concepts are used

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,980
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case what we want to talk about</font>

166
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:16,939
is mental cliche medically che<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

167
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,000
idea that after a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we just</font>

168
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,060
automatically associate a concept with

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,230
the various emotions thoughts and ideas

170
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,469
just one after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other so everybody in</font>

171
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:36,930
the room who can fill this in for me

172
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:39,180
life liberty and the pursuit of exactly

173
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,260
everybody knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all agree to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

174
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,670
we all get that it's medrol cliche it

175
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,590
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less true that doesn't</font>

176
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:51,110
devalue it it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

177
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:56,250
we've all had in your into us over time

178
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:58,170
why do these all work together well they

179
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,680
hit people all together at the

180
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,449
observation level so to use an academic

181
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,640
to use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain it all together</font>

182
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:12,990
basically what happens is the idea

183
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,280
centers of a society create the concepts

184
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:20,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then filter out for the rest of us</font>

185
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,850
so info work on somebody presents a

186
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:27,630
brilliant idea on how we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to begin</font>

187
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:32,870
thinking about art and how that artistry

188
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,850
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to combat Isis and therefore</font>

189
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,170
that idea now begins percolating around

190
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,050
and it generates for

191
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,240
five separate papers those four or five

192
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,540
separate papers move out one into the

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,459
art world<font color="#E5E5E5"> two in two different combatant</font>

194
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,579
commanders hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

195
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:54,010
published and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden the</font>

196
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:56,550
art world is now considering well two or

197
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,720
three people generate papers that are

198
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,699
against it they think it's a terrible

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,470
idea but two or three people write<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

200
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,209
and say you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is important</font>

201
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,910
that we get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there independent the</font>

202
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,189
combatant commanders love the idea they

203
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,410
want three or four you know study set up

204
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,880
RAND Corporation sees it and goes hey

205
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,500
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had this great idea</font>

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out the study on the</font>

207
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,170
effectiveness of of information

208
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:23,920
operations the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas are spreading</font>

209
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:28,060
percolating out this is just the natural

210
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">process of it and it's affecting us at</font>

211
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,380
the observation orientation level is it

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:39,610
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-making purpose it's just</font>

213
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:49,449
working natural so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were targeted</font>

214
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:50,890
do what would happen in doing this we

215
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:54,459
have a bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods and</font>

216
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,069
tools printing press is one of them if

217
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:59,380
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were too excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me all right</font>

218
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,769
max I really like this idea go out and

219
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like all right well okay printing</font>

220
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,760
press that's going to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an</font>

221
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,449
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect the academics in</font>

222
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the society primarily books newspapers</font>

223
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,290
magazines pamphlets primarily for the

224
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,560
literate people who like to read people

225
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:21,069
who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in reading but we've</font>

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:26,279
also got comics now I said Charlie Hebdo

227
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:29,110
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who that is exactly</font>

228
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,610
Charlie was very important who's killed

229
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,290
because he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an effect on</font>

230
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,399
people who are not necessarily academic

231
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,649
reminded but he was having an effect on

232
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,639
the primary recruitment centers or

233
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:44,440
Islamic radicalization he had to be

<font color="#E5E5E5">stopped I mean had you killed me had to</font>

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">be made an example of that others would</font>

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:53,670
not get involved so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a very</font>

237
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,670
powerful map

those of us who are familiar with them

communicating with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> American</font>

passed that had some very few that had

some difficulty with getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

Congress it's an evocative form of

communication that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

require a literate population and

250
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,860
especially when you have difficulty

251
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:36,670
distributing materials to people it can

be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective one other period place</font>

communications into denied areas like

the Warsaw Pact countries during cold

have braces and stand up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't</font>

260
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
show America's Jane week that was an

261
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,040
evocative message that Hitler used to

262
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,620
consistently only original wire

most young people get their information

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">right it's an empty MPs and part of them</font>

280
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,589
in it says MPs are debating the effects

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah okay watch these dark miss you too</font>

287
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:21,800
many in the one above well guess what

288
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,439
testers a lot of young people would also

289
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,209
believe this to be accurate here's the

290
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem it's completely false and here's</font>

291
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,290
here's how you can tell without having

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,599
there's actually no way of knowing if

294
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,610
this is true it's just what somebody

295
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,230
slapped the picture on caption it the

296
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,720
way they wanted and sent it out there I

297
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,279
mean this part's true they are debating

298
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,019
the effects of welfare reform up here

299
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,579
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not necessarily what they're</font>

300
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,889
debating down here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

301
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,559
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it</font>

302
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:57,709
because we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mimetic belief in the</font>

303
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:01,009
general corruption and lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use of</font>

304
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:08,809
our election officials well I won't tell

305
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:16,939
you yours are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok 1080 p</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

306

<font color="#E5E5E5">Congress and our young people are not</font>

307
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:20,179
getting much better because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

308
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,998
fact-check or identify bias and

309
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,089
propaganda in the internet either so

310
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:28,610
we're ending up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where</font>

311
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,990
you know you won't watch what you're

312
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,759
reading you won't watch what your next

313
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,410
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trained to do this it</font>

314
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really perfect checkers appear</font>

315
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,819
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a developing or so people are</font>

316
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,189
aware that there is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I show you</font>

317
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,809
today workers know when you say thanks

318
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:47,209
what you're talking about the rarefied

319
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:49,339
few he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the masses oh no</font>

320
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,799
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the masses I'm talking</font>

321
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,569
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> children in school are not</font>

322
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,819
taught to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to question things</font>

323
00:16:53,569 --> 00:17:00,649
like this even in the high school up

324
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:02,449
right over might question right

325
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,419
that's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that'll be nice but</font>

326
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:07,129
we're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rarefied few and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Greek</font>

327
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,980
and then so that's part of the problem

328
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,319
and that's definitely problem but we're

329
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,689
seeing things like snopes.com appear

330
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,148
that that people are really looking to

331
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,209
it to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this real or real or no</font>

332
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,099
real that's

333
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,309
try to ask but here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other issue</font>

334
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:27,589
though it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes a</font>

335
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:30,899
special education<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go chiron no chiron</font>

336
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,730
but traditional but the traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

337
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,439
of thinking rights to control through

338
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,210
religion everything don't question no

339
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,309
you're you're absolutely so having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

340
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,950
population that can question things like

341
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,649
this is actually in a way damaging to

342
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,690
potential forms of government because

343
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,789
you do wind up the West<font color="#E5E5E5"> population</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">survey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kopelman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys well that is</font>

345
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:53,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reality night we're instance a</font>

346
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,870
school district<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it won't allow or</font>

347
00:17:53,669 --> 00:18:01,980
that would not allow I don't know maybe

348
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,570
Darwinism to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become well we can get into</font>

349
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different analytical aspects of it</font>

350
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,139
later but here's the interesting

351
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,539
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part the important part is</font>

352
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,779
that our those underlying biases that

353
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:17,299
are built into our society they happen

354
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:19,950
naturally it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weekend however</font>

355
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,190
guide them and shift them in other

356
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:27,179
people's societies so in nature of that

357
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,520
let's make things not go boo because if

358
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,640
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> guide them we can guide them out</font>

359
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,710
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to war before we</font>

361
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,870
put them into a uniform give them a gun

362
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,279
and say here go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and make them</font>

363
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,100
do what we want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do because we</font>

364
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:48,840
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it right the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time so</font>

365
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,549
step one take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> target</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you</font>

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:57,000
because creating a new ideology for a

00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,399
changing a single villages idea or

372
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:10,649
not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> much longer depending on</font>

373
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,370
that that local community but it is

374
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:19,500
going to take longer then step to learn

375
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:22,408
everything everything you can about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

targets values beliefs and motivations

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:30,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to absolutely i'm going to reiterate</font>

378
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,950
that everything which will make easy

379
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,620
buddy

380
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,320
bodies posting what they're doing it for

381
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,590
seconds sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're trying</font>

382
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn about a group of people that</font>

383
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,539
are living in a pre-internet

384
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-internet society in which case that</font>

385
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:52,679
thought is easy but it's still important

386
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:54,179
um yes well no I just say that even

387
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,100
social media in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways is</font>

388
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,830
deployed of context so you have to go

389
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,750
beyond that immerse yourself in the

390
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,490
culture true<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good if they are in</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to get this information I'd</font>

393
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,289
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add for that you still while</font>

394
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,268
you're doing that I'll some damp like

395
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,549
Michael because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

you perspectives on this I mean one of

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hardest and biggest problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

399
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,070
difficulty that we've had an accessing

400
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,830
cultural and anthropological and

401
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,019
sociological expertise just simply

402
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,360
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the misunderstanding on their</font>

403
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,100
part of the importance of what they do

404
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,629
yes good you want to throw something<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

405
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,360
i mean there were studies going back

406
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the first Desert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Storm you know</font>

407
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,129
where in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> win the quote for</font>

408
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,419
hearts and minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that for</font>

409
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,279
studies that we show it's a to

410
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,769
generational process in order to make

411
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective change but we can't think</font>

412
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,649
that far in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future we can't take</font>

413
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than a few months in advance</font>

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas the Chinese like you said they</font>

415
00:20:54,889 --> 00:21:02,519
generate all I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be read with</font>

416
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:04,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so where is nine step 3 use</font>

417
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,440
this knowledge I know it seems very

418
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,090
linear very boring would decide how

419
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,399
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design and deliver these</font>

420
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,129
ideas these<font color="#CCCCCC"> memes should we target</font>

421
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,678
intellectuals or the young should we go

422
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,990
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kindergartners or should we go</font>

423
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,029
for college professors I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

424
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,460
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on who we want to change and why</font>

425
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,679
because so wouldn't that be yes if

426
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,340
you're if you're really looking for our

427
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,230
culture don't you go for all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you of</font>

428
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,658
and everything you possibly not

429
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,909
necessarily because just because you're

430
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> covertly or clandestinely</font>

431
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,710
does not mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">heavy-footed everybody all the time look</font>

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,210
at me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just means maybe</font>

434
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,640
you endow

435
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,309
30 or 40 chairs at major major

436
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,549
institutions inside that country or in

437
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:55,590
countries international where it would

438
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,990
that have a major programs that you want

439
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:02,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a finger in law school broad</font>

440
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:04,320
like Fulbright because that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh it's a</font>

441
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,230
softer way of doing it so it keeps

442
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,500
people from going hey what you're doing

443
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,899
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really creepy so by the same</font>

444

token it's not covert or clandestine

445
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,918
nobody's going to you know people can

446
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,418
see what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not being</font>

447
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,909
secretive or manipulative about it it's

448
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I'm doing this anybody can see what</font>

449
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm doing I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to get at</font>

452
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,220
really good education I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:35,070
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids a great educational program</font>

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:41,130
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to tell it of you if</font>

455
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:42,840
you're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hollow yes or the biggest</font>

456
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem that more one of the big</font>

457
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,970
problems that we've seen at least when I

458
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:52,799
when I was studying this was that people

459
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:56,460
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after an arbitrary note they</font>

460
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,740
would say well in my society we want to

461
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,510
go after the intellectuals so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

462
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,159
society<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go after the</font>

463
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,230
intellectuals well in a theocratic

464
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,870
society you don't want to go back to me

465
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,260
like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after the spiritual</font>

466
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,580
or the priesthood so in that case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

467
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,870
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to the children</font>

468
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,668
because the children might grow up to be

469
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,899
carpenters and if I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> influenced a</font>

470
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,399
bunch of carpenters to think the way

471
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:24,479
that I did well that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do me any</font>

472
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:27,168
good except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> court but I you know</font>

473
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,049
Mary percent of the people that I in

474
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:33,179
photographers and stonemasons and and

475
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,039
electricians and computer scientists who

476
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:38,039
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fall right in line with the</font>

477
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,110
political<font color="#CCCCCC"> class and the theologians then</font>

478
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,570
I just wasted ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

479
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,240
effort but what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I mean you know</font>

480
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,700
so so I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question in all</font>

481
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,640
honesty here if you're if you have

482
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,130
influenced the entire population<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

483
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,639
know every every single child that goes

484
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,169
through educational program and all of

485
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,789
those children<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow up to have</font>

486
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:02,789
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of instilled in</font>

487
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,649
them did you waste it because you've got

488
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:06,480
the theologians too that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

489
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:08,668
question let me pose a counter question

490
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,669
what if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have gone for the</font>

491
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:14,190
theologians more directly still without

492
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">them noticing and then the theologians</font>

493
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,220
got the politicians to institute the

494
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,080
same thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font>

495
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,850
all the money I didn't have to go do it

496
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,090
directly they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it themselves</font>

497
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you spent on these historical case</font>

498
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,259
in point where nice and how I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

499
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,299
overthrow our veins in Guatemala with

500
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,739
the advice of grenades they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

501
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,289
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Catholic priests all over the</font>

502
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:36,239
country to buy about an exaggerated what

503
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,070
our ventures<font color="#CCCCCC"> when viewers completely</font>

504
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:39,809
fabricated broken but it's so

505
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,369
effectively change the hearts and minds

506
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roman Catholic so if that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

507
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:46,139
resolve it that they supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

508
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,850
overthrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause really like you I met</font>

509
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:49,289
have we forgotten that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

510
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,850
them well that's that's different from

511
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:53,249
what I'm discussing that's more of a

512
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,668
again focusing on the rescission point

513
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:59,009
than the observation orientation point

514
00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:00,720
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're next up once we got this</font>

515
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,749
knowledge we figured out what section we

516
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,320
want to target we spread the idea keep

517
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:09,299
the idea simple because this is an

518
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,158
iterative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

519
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,320
us quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time like you</font>

520
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,590
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it this is a long-term</font>

521
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,779
project this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick fix this</font>

522
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:23,939
isn't fire-and-forget so the hope poster

523
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:26,759
yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the whole poster that's</font>

524
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,559
not close enough it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point but</font>

525
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,769
it's the strategies what it's a champion

526
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,059
yeah yeah exactly was good so we got it

527
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:38,249
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust this as necessary and</font>

528
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:42,658
allow it to take fully take effect it

529
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:44,249
needs time it's expensive but it's not

530
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,289
expensive when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's compared to the</font>

531
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,539
costs of a traditional military

532
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:52,470
adventure so what do you mean with

533
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:54,419
expensive well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> average cost</font>

534
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,850
of endow a professorship at a u.s.

535
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,279
colleges a million bucks so that's

536
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,580
expensive but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you compare it to say</font>

537
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,369
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> George Soros or koch brothers spend</font>

538
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,949
on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> american political campaign that's</font>

539
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:11,928
not that expense and a professor is

540
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:14,299
going to be there for 20 or 30 years

541
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:17,869
writing papers teaching classes and

542
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:21,110
providing against people what's the cost

543
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:23,600
of putting an imam through school and

544
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:29,389
then building a Madras up for them to

545
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach at compared to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of you</font>

546
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:36,709
know take you no cost I last I saw half

547
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,769
a million dollars to put a soldier

548
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,200
through boot camp<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put them all the</font>

549
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:45,379
way through training to a fully trained

550
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,629
soldier in the u.s. no not after four

551
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:50,149
years at the college going to do not not

552
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:51,889
including all the other costs that come

553
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,748
after that which hey I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't begrudge</font>

554
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:58,158
them god bless them for what they do I'm

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take time to set up the tools</font>

566
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,639
it's going to take time to master the

567

tool it's going to take time to to

out and it's going to take time once we

started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the ideas seep in you</font>

because once you give an idea to

576
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,809
somebody it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this is</font>

577
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,299
great I like freedom do you like freedom

578
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:04,190
no it's hey I like freedom freedom is a

579
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:05,570
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool idea I should consider this</font>

580
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,009
and write about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're</font>

581
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,710
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea and it's going to</font>

582
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through a permutation so maybe you</font>

583
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,669
have to introduce another idea now to

584
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,340
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's your concept of</font>

585
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:19,730
freedom doesn't lead to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

586
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,220
could lead to something horrible so that

587
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,029
is a question is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you were game</font>

588
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,309
out unintended consequences

589
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,779
it's a very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question and it's one</font>

590
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,549
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you a lot more work</font>

591
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,019
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very new ideas far as I can</font>

592
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:33,658
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been looking for other people</font>

593
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,609
who report on it I'm an able find<font color="#E5E5E5"> me you</font>

594
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,369
know so let's keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on let's keep</font>

595
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:41,369
studying for another thing else that you

596
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,408
could you look at the increasing spirit

597
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:45,889
influence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> china is trying to do in</font>

598
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,940
Africa and South and Central America

599
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:50,369
again they're doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term thing</font>

600
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they're investing heavily in</font>

601
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:54,330
infrastructure and at the same time

602
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,709
building schools but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> building power</font>

603
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,949
plants so they're making revenue

604
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,419
generation off of the leasing and the

605
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,210
loans to make the power plants but

606
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,349
they're also building schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I</font>

607
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,940
don't know whether using their influence

608
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:07,109
to make sure the teaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a certain</font>

609
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,700
way or what but at least they<font color="#CCCCCC"> made the</font>

610
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,899
school so already the populace are

611
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,349
thinking of them in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different light</font>

612
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:14,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">than we do and that's going to go on for</font>

613
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,779
decades well that's like the cocaine

614
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:20,519
guys and the current smells are exactly

615
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,409
you know you need a new church well yo

616
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,659
Pablo Escobar's build a new church and

617
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:28,200
just about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fuels exactly</font>

618
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:30,539
exactly so I'm gonna I'm going to expand

619
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,549
on something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was said earlier this</font>

620
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:35,450
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this can pay dividends though it</font>

621
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:38,039
does take time it is cheap in comparison

622
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,649
but it's kind of like dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

623
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,779
hydro from Greek mythology once you cut

624
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:46,139
off a head and you burn it the head

625
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:49,229
won't grow back once we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided an</font>

626
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:51,498
idea once we've provided this area with

627
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:54,330
the concepts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want them to have</font>

628
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:56,639
we actually have built somebody who will

629
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:00,239
think the way not we want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

630
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:02,158
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> will think in a sympathetic way it's</font>

631
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:08,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">not mine controllers before I throw your</font>

632
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:11,009

633
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem I've got just get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around this in</font>

00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1980's the American car industry</font>

635
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:18,539
nearly destroyed itself because of

636
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:21,259
groupthink yep how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you avoid having</font>

640
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:33,119
you've observed it you oriented it I

can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you do with that but</font>

642
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,789
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one saying how do you avoid</font>

643
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:40,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">groupthink message that influences violo</font>

the 80s good question you take ah you

646
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,249
mean in terms of what I'm puttin out

647
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:52,309
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're we are</font>

648
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:53,779
not a siege<font color="#E5E5E5"> is oh well that's going to</font>

649
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,789
because because what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with</font>

650
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:57,889
that is we're tailoring the message not

651
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:00,019
only to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual culture but the</font>

652
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:04,519
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> known within that individual</font>

653
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:07,639
a culture and depending on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how</font>

654
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,409
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> note takes it if it's an academic</font>

655
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,559
that we might be inserting an actual

656
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:15,139
person in there as opposed to a book or

657
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,999
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper but your tailoring a message but</font>

658
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,498
I think two wins point what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

659
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,509
message your tailor well it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

660
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:22,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a hand I mean you know we can we can</font>

661
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,979
change the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know your</font>

662
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,629
tailoring a shirt but it's a shirt are

663
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:28,039
we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be longer sure agree on the</font>

664
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:29,719
message or we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the State</font>

665
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,940
Department of the White House or whoever

666
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,879
it is to agree on the message or would

667
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,419
it be better to create an NGO that's not

668
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:40,459
using any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things and influence</font>

669
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,649
your LMS money hasn't took the only

670
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">other funding for the people who support</font>

671
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:46,849
message that they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

672
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,429
know that goes are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so original your</font>

673
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:51,229
point corporatized put it offshore<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

674
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:53,720
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> those eyes a tough question okay</font>

675
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:56,720
let's ask the real tough one how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

676
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,330
earn money<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it how are you going to</font>

677
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,889
show over a better of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years that</font>

678
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,320
what you're trying to do is actually

679
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:05,080
happening because it doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

680
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,369
just kind of come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

681
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,168
since you're looking for measures of

682
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,928
effectiveness right brother but I want

683
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,299
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add to not only just did it but was</font>

684
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,590
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of what you did right and not</font>

685
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,918
just have a certain actually not

686
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,928
necessarily a stupid now yo can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

687
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,659
I've been hearing government I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

688
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:27,289
hearing all kinds of things but and I

689
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:31,759
heard one person saying corporation can

690
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">accompany</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earn money from this and can</font>

691
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,070
it be done over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time because I</font>

692
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,220
don't want to earn and earn a thousand

693
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,899
dollars and be told to walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

694
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,909
first off to answer the measure of

695
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:46,039
effectiveness questions you can measure

696
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:48,559
effectiveness because what you can do at

697
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,500
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of the academic or</font>

698
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,440
theological you can measure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

699
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,800
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many sermons lesson plans or</font>

700
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,150
other things are covering this thematic

701
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,680
concept then I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> another point ok</font>

702
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:07,340
Larry diamonds is the professor of our

703
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,980
at Stanford I was a democracy short

704
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,280
democracy studies he has done great it's

705
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,140
all over the world to say just how

706
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,520
people feel about democracy and one of

707
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,610
the things that came out of his studies

708
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,340
is that with in some of the least thank

709
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,990
the democratic societies in the world so

710
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,879
the Congo for example Zimbabwe let they

711
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,150
had a ninety percent approval rating of

712
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,400
democracy so in the area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

713
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">focusing on they are very much thought</font>

714
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,990
into these concepts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> democracy but</font>

715
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,930
it's not helping it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing anything</font>

716
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,760
so that was back to knowing the target

717
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,740
and knowing what you want to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

718
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want that thing that what</font>

719
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,610
you're sowing about none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but what</font>

720
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,110
do you mean it's different boy if you're

721
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,699
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about having something change</font>

722
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,169
that means that there's a behavior that

723
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,270
changes and right now what you're

724
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,550
focusing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not i'm talking about</font>

725
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,260
battlefield preparation exactly I'm so

726
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,820
in this case you wouldn't go that you

727
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,620
wouldn't ask me to go to the Congo and

728
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,550
change their means about democracy

729
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,439
because they already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety percent</font>

730
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">approval rating foods amok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recei I'd say</font>

731
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,389
to you why they like it you don't need

732
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,850
me for that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go to the</font>

733
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,470
condo and tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be democratic why</font>

734
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,210
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bother they already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like so</font>

735
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,250
it's not democracy when you want to

736
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,540
influences it's getting them to stop

737
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">killing each other so that they'll</font>

738
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,779
implement democracy or something like

739
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,310
that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that would be what you</font>

740
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,340
would ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change right yeah</font>

741
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,679
smaller yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're talking</font>

742
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,000
about with hold on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got because I got</font>

743
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,600
another concept I got an answer but then

744
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,460
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you okay so monetizing it that</font>

745
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,460
is a different question because that

746
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,139
would depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the structure I haven't</font>

747
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X here it'll</font>

748
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">build with that yes sir so I mean</font>

749
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:55,790
question I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you were talking</font>

750
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:00,800
about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a metric for</font>

751
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:03,560
having influence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we observe phase</font>

752
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,059
right the decision the decision to

753
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,950
become

754
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:11,489
requires an action those are phases that

755
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:15,089
all review the loop right so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

756
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:17,249
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause and effect disconnect</font>

757
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:20,759
here and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that once we'll</font>

758
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:23,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">be learning inputs at the observed phase</font>

759
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:26,729
that we will get decisions and actions

760
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:29,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow proud are our insertion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

761
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:31,589
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> but my point is that that is not</font>

762
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,569
necessarily true<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it sounds what</font>

763
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:35,729
I'm saying how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we how do we know that</font>

764
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:38,220
once we've inserted the idea that will

765
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:41,489
get a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your hundred action as</font>

766
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,979
you are asked yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

767
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:48,509
goal with this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily to</font>

768
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:51,749
lead to a specific decision point the

769
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:54,720
goal is is to make it easier to to

770
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:56,939
soften them up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> later action to push</font>

771
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,788
a decision so for example to use the

772
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,589
Russians as you pointed out there living

773
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:04,680
in a society now where there is no

774
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:06,119
objective reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay alright so we've</font>

775
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to go i'll be happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

776
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,650
this more later on thank you all very

777
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,649
much Thank You limbo
