that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been streaming and using</font>

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,320
bandwidth if we tone it down at least

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this make sure that we have minimal</font>

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,079
interruptions indoor bandwidth joy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,830
introduction that's a pleasure again to

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,900
be here this year even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a bit far</font>

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,710
away so I could not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> made the trip</font>

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nashville Tennessee we're using the</font>

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">beautiful part of rock along with a bit</font>

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">of good bandwidth drive the message</font>

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">across I traveled pretty much across</font>

27
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,689
also in the Middle East countries are

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,689
you with the exception of Iran so far

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,809
and a lot of the African<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,329
especially subs are in a North African

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,500
countries so that covers pretty much as

32
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,740
you can see the wide Middle East<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,630
today my topic is a bit about the Middle

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,309
East cyber war so i'll try to kind of

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,100
bring you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit and up to date of</font>

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,950
the some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topics and hopefully</font>

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,729
we'll make it interesting for the next

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,729
45 50 minutes

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i guess the topic is probably</font>

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,789
appropriate are you ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Middle</font>

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,598
East cyber wars and I guess this applies

42
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:13,459
certainly as much to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Middle East</font>

43
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,470
cyber works towards Middle East or cyber

44
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,970
wars potentially originating in the

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">Middle East as certainly some have been</font>

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,580
experiencing so getting straight into

47
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the topic since I work for an</font>

48
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,670
organization that has some very serious

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,530
ambitions that I have to start with the

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,649
disclaimer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is my presentation</font>

51
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,989
on this topic certainly not the opinion

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,470
of my organization that I happen to do

53
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:45,290
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for it is some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

54
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,170
material and based on knowledge and a

55
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,599
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-worker colleagues and</font>

56
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:56,619
obviously it's a matter of opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> so do</font>

57
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:59,120
not try this at home so the Middle East

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,120
continues to evolve I guess at a fairly

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,630
rapid pace as you can see it can call it

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,130
i guess the much wilder<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle East and</font>

61
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,859
certainly one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

62
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,870
there's a lot of activity some attempts

63
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,810
to maybe potentially even redraw some

64
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,639
borders as we proceed obviously all this

65
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,410
conflict exists on the ground in the

66
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,940
physical world but it's also at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

67
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:26,389
time creating an arms race in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cyber</font>

68
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,790
world so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cyber world affects</font>

69
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,790
directly the Middle East but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also tends</font>

70
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,370
to kind of overflow to the wider Middle

71
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,650
East or even to Europe or North America

72
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,919
from time to time as certainly it's been

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,230
experienced in the past in order to

74
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand a bit of the capabilities in</font>

75
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the arms race this is I guess where we</font>

76
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,078
can wrapped up last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers may</font>

77
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit dated but certainly they</font>

78
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,380
apply here in the sense that you can

79
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,950
have at the top of the list countries

80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,720
like us in Israel spending the biggest

81
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,040
one money and allowing them to build up

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,159
capability but certainly what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,469
seen is many other countries like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey</font>

84
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,899
certainly Iran and Saudi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arabia UAE</font>

85
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,100
spending a lot more in the upcoming

86
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,310
years

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,290
and allow them to build up capability in

88
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,760
the physical world as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

89
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,190
cyber world and certainly another

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,710
country that needs to be added but this

91
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,830
top of the list is a guitar because of

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:32,630
Qatar is playing a much more active role

93
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:35,000
so in all these borders so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she'll go</font>

94
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years ago the first</font>

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,850
submarine couple cables cuts<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

96
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,599
2008 they were actually originally

97
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,970
designed to affect to a specific country

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,980
but this cable cut actually affected the

99
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,320
physical infrastructure of many of the

100
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:59,150
other neighboring countries so you can

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:01,659
see why you're not seeing my slide

102
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,630
events ok so again you're quite a full

103
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,630
presentation mode on the lower left I i

104
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,530
went to full presentation notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our</font>

105
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:14,450
way I am in PowerPoint but I am in

106
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">double go to full screen mode I think</font>

107
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:21,590
it's your f5 key yes I'm in full screen

108
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:26,330
mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi sis what's called normal you</font>

109
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,599
know slide showed you working something

110
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:34,510
different you may have to manually<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash</font>

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all you see layout or anything ok um</font>

112
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok no let me try to sort of go back</font>

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:50,950
William we will load F two or three

114
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">options one option is to certain risks</font>

115
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,050
I'll try to go back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other start</font>

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
stop sharing that then maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

117
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,090
else let's see what happens here that

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,330
you're lovely but there is no i do not

119
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:10,190
see the you know the other application

120
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:13,070
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the powerpoint view although it</font>

121
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,660
is active now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does not show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up as an</font>

122
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:20,120
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

123
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,419
probably just manually so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll just</font>

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,889
shrink more left in five embarrassing

125
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:31,219
the presentation if you by HP

126
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll share this one share now this will</font>

127
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:42,980
be as close let me see if I can shrink

128
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:49,609
some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> why good for it you can see</font>

129
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:52,330
Middle East borders<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good copy is</font>

130
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,880
like an maybe maybe even visited mark

131
00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:01,159
this should give you a better feeling

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:04,580
little arms race you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> bubbles so</font>

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,260
this is pretty much the spending that

134
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,210
keeps on increasing in the physical

135
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,260
world but also translates into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cyber</font>

136
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,930
world the<font color="#CCCCCC"> submarine cable cuts that</font>

137
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,500
happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2008 was kind of an initial</font>

138
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">wake-up call it affected quite a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

139
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,370
the countries including Bahrain Saudi

140
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,380
Arabia Egypt etc but of course one of

141
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:31,130
the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries got affected was</font>

142
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,770
certainly Egypt I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only got</font>

143
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,820
affected in the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days by the cable</font>

144
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,130
cut but also by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two versions of the</font>

that tends to happen a bit after the

and realized very quickly were the two

292
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,250
exploits so you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that countries</font>

293
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,930
today are building a store of these

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,220
exploits that they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to use</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on demand basis if they need to use them</font>

296

297
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,620
the mercenaries and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

298
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,690
recipe gets a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated okay</font>

299
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,910
not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the countries have the same</font>

capabilities but the small country like

301
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:05,120
Israel sees himself surrounded by foes

302
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,010
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> as one of the biggest</font>

although is a very small country in size

305

China rather but certainly I ran in the

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:33,990
Middle East is becoming a major

314

315
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,820
that countries like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel see this is a</font>

response towards the telco operators and

338
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,620
protecting the telco data because they

339

366
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,360
the basics most of the attacks today

367
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,360
actually start with very simple phishing

368
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,179
scams we saw this happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your RSA</font>

369
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,600
but this went much well beyond our essay

370
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,730
we have specifically one individual was

371
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,730
able to draft himself a letter that

372
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,280
allow him actually to leave prison now

373
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,100
you can quickly examine that fishing

374
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:28,470
especially if it carried out correctly

375
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:31,590
can actually drive a very good effective

a lot of the new stations like for

393
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,909
example CNBC Forbes Tribune etc so they

from the US military but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we quickly</font>

493
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:04,210
realize that a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search was</font>

able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> retrieve with most of this</font>

495
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,169
information so obviously information

certainly controlled or viewed in a

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually brought down the website</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">developed some capabilities as you know</font>

508
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,900

<font color="#E5E5E5">these individuals have taken to the dark</font>

516

where by using tor or other similar

00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:04,450
technologies basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoided being</font>

tracked or at least making tracking of

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:13,720
their activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

520
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:17,950
anonymous then<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to attack Isis as</font>

521
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,230
well so they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create highly</font>

distributed denial-of-service attacks

against some of the ISIS social networks

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,790
etc interesting operation about this

525
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,210
attack is although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was partly</font>

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:33,639
successful the technology like

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,850
a much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective way so you can see</font>

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,190
the Alliance's the usage keeps changing

very dramatically there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

lot of information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

539
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,290

540
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:12,010
have increased substantial the number of

541
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:16,389
attacks and an increase of 128 percent

542
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:18,450
and 2014 so you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,270
building much more sophisticated

made<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of glass what it really means</font>

564
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,109
is that we have launched fairly

565
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,999
sophisticated cyber attacks but at the

566
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:20,978
same time we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not developed the</font>

capabilities to protect some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

569
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,210
obviously not only applies to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">this includes three or four primary</font>

certainly Saudi Arabia is asserting

himself as an hour Qatar and obviously a

655
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,830
UAE as well so they are all concerned

656
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,159
with protecting their critical

how to control social media so there's

that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit the information that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the word counter but you use the word</font>

676
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,710
certainly the Middle East countries have

taken the appraised<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach of</font>

capability to counter social media

683

effectively what it really means is that

684
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:57,370
simple organization like the Syrian

685
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:02,470

which is locally known as dash have been

687
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,940
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use social media much more</font>

688
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,390
effectively if you

689
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,280
go back to my presentation of last year

690
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:15,100
certainly the release of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue crepe</font>

691
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,070
pictures generated the whole big

headache on social media and which seems

693
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,770
like we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> not learned Isis has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,950
more effectively in the social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

696
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,460
the way is being used today for

697
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,230
recruiting and many other aspects and

698
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,440
either we are not blocking the accounts

699
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,360
or we're not doing a counter response

700
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:54,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is effective enough to this social</font>

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,730

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,659
the natives so how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in that</font>

asymmetric type of environment turn the

tables is there any way to do so or do

713
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,480
we just simply accept the fact that we

714
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,730
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be more vulnerable</font>

than they are to anything in cyberspace

many ways the capabilities of both

parties are many ways far apart and

721
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,830
they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes very basic</font>

that the very basic techniques that they

725
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,650
use are actually being used very

726
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,740
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> and although we have very</font>

727
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:08,890
sophisticated cyber weapons or certs

728
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,930
etcetera we're not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to</font>

729
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,850
these very basic techniques and by the

<font color="#E5E5E5">way this applies to phishing attempts or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are investing all this new capability is</font>

733
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:24,150
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada is investing a lot</font>

this research field with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the central</font>

organization in which they have

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,569
developed partially an offensive

737
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,820
capability we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> China developing</font>

738
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,220
an offensive capability as you saw in

739
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:39,160
most recent reports but you can see

740
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,319
quickly that this is good but we're

741
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:48,940
still failing some of the basics which

742
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:50,440
for me is is quite amazing what do you

743
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,150
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're kind of failing to basics</font>

744
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,270
because we don't have as much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">as I success I mean they have a point to</font>

749
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,740
they're wrong actually it's a

750
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,100
combination of many of the items that

of documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been recently</font>

captured and some of them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

discussed some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the activities they do</font>

759
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,420
all over the map in nature but they

760
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,020
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a purpose in which they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">taken but we don't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to be</font>

766
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,620
in a position to actually contract this
