1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:35,070
okay in the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days of info workin on</font>

2
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,340
mom wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring a UAV for a live</font>

3
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,260
demo you're out there right now they

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,719
look like boring bees but I think our

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,480
UAVs muggers and huge and we had it all

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">planned out with the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exception the</font>

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,050
hotel neglected to tell us it was going

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,550
to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty thousand dollars</font>

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,440
because we would have had to remove the

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:59,459
entire front<font color="#E5E5E5"> door revolving structure</font>

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,690
needless to say we didn't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,159
coin obviously we have a drone symbol

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,590
because that's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar so a lot of what</font>

14
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,979
we're dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days and Hans</font>

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:18,360
is a comes from that space and so please

16
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,400
Hans mum thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a i'll give you a</font>

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chat here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to make</font>

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,020
sure the first thing off I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

19
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,049
all the answers I have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,119
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas I come to a few</font>

21
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,060
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusions as you can see</font>

22
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,310
it's a applying complexity leadership

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,780
theory most people haven't heard of it

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,509
because it really didn't exist before i

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
started create it for my dissertation

26
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,350
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ended up getting the</font>

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">title of doctor was to create this the</font>

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,798
interesting part behind this is most of

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,720
the time complexity theory is looked at

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,630
in the way of mathematics and other

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,840
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i applied it to the humans and a</font>

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,939
little bit different so when it said

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,810
I've actually been speaking it in for

34
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,658
work on since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> late 1990s and in</font>

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,119
between times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually hadn't seen</font>

36
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,640
when in many years or Betty in many

37
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,169
years and so I want to just catch a

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,500
couple of people up because I do see a

39
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,950
few familiar faces since 1999 as to what

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,520
I've been

41
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and how I ended up back on this stage</font>

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,629
so if you've ever seen the Iraqi regime

43
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,370
playing cards with Saddam is the ace of

44
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:26,459
spades I was the officer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in charge that</font>

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,680
program after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 911 I made a conscious</font>

46
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,840
choice to leave the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of</font>

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,450
actually good money guys leave that

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,220
world and I designed a multiple fuel

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,679
optimization system using artificial

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,569
intelligence and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pemba pumping sensors</font>

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,410
different direction I was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

52
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:49,079
on UAVs on 911 i was actually cresting

53
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,329
the hill headed to the Pentagon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet</font>

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,549
with them because at the time UAVs were

55
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,470
not a nice thing they were not

56
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,360
interested I know that somebody done a

57
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,430
presentation before and said you know

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,220
now that we have their attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

59
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,260
now we have their attention with UAVs I

60
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,720
was cresting the hill the plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> went</font>

61
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the side of the the Pentagon my</font>

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> partner at the time Jay was</font>

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
sitting in the Pentagon parking lot it

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,810
was an old f-111 f-15 fighter pilot and

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,670
he saw the black smoke he knew what had

66
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,910
happened he<font color="#CCCCCC"> called me on the phone he</font>

67
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,130
said turn around go home is done and I

68
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,260
called my commander I was a reservist at

69
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,530
the time called my commander decided I

70
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,888
would go on active duty from there so

71
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:37,130
needless to say so how did what happened

72
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,130
after this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little project go ahead I</font>

73
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,700
would add that information wise

74
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,060
coalition governments have identified a

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,268
list of key regime leaders who must be

76
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,120
pursued and brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to justice the key</font>

77
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,180
list has 55 individuals who may be

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,340
pursued killed or captured and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

79
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,670
does not exclude leaders who may have

<font color="#E5E5E5">already been killed or captured this</font>

ease identification when contact does

occur<font color="#E5E5E5"> this deck of cards is one example</font>

cards in the deck

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,130
look I me are there yes I go to cnn.com

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,200
a deck over 55 most<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted and does that</font>

92
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:49,950
include the former information minister

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:52,740
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time the joke well said</font>

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,659
Jeff right well there are jokers in this

95
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,700
deck there's no doubt about that and

96
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also there are cards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

97
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:13,590
till tomorrow so<font color="#CCCCCC"> after I enjoyed some</font>

98
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,780
free vacations to Iraq and by the way

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really quite sure you know a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of you might be in the military here I</font>

101
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,870
haven't quite figured out when I my

102
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,640
volunteer to go and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

tickets they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave me one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way tickets</font>

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,070
unlike guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it cheaper to give me</font>

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,110
round trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one way</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ticket you get to fight your way home so</font>

107
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,080
after ending up as a wounded warrior in

108

2009 and being tossed out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

said you ain't make it 20 take the

111
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,180
medical and go I went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that</font>

112
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:50,940
I started off in writing books and I

113
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,160
also helped to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design a new type of a</font>

114
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,350
helicopter flight simulator this is

115
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,650
actually the world's first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and only faa</font>

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,570
certified portable flight simulator

117
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,880
which means it's so advanced that

118
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,790
literally when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fly in this thing you</font>

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,640
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually log time in your log book i</font>

also current activities i was just

lunch and after i got done explaining

all this when looked at me sternly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESA's</font>

leadership in the current faa challenge

137
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,219
what I did was I actually applied in

138
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,889
something called complexity leadership

139
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:56,929
theory to the FAA drone integration

challenge right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now their challenge of</font>

141
00:06:56,929 --> 00:07:02,119
course is that the policy leadership and

management of UAVs<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are looking at</font>

it they being fa in the US government

00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:08,779
very linear and very authoritarian we

145
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,639
are moving in this direction and you

146

will do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I tell you you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do it okay now all of us here</font>

148
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:19,429
probably over 15 maybe 20 years old

149
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,289
possible um how's that going to work out

150
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:23,419
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids today you going to tell</font>

151
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">them what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you can look at them and</font>

152
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,039
say you're going to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell</font>

153
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,799
you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do it no no not going</font>

154
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way the FAA has been trying</font>

155
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:36,619
for 15 to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years right now to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

156
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:39,828
with UAB legislation governance and

157
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:42,409
policies hey anybody know how many they

158
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:44,689
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there right now correct it's</font>

159
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:46,789
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero they actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have stuff</font>

160
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,399
that's out there in the public you have

161
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,919
to be very careful when they put out any

162
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,919
information operations when they put out

163
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,899
some interesting articles because the

164
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,409
articles will talk to the idea that they

165
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:03,019
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have UAV policy that's not what</font>

166
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:06,349
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says it says that they have policy</font>

167
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:08,149
that's being put out or public comments

168
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:13,128
which means it's three to five years

169
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:15,969
away good and if that one so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

170
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,929
becomes that there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

171
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,539
challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming into play</font>

172
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:22,429
you've got everybody from amazon and

173
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,549
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people are saying well</font>

174
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:27,708
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stunt it's not a stunt</font>

175
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:29,719
amazon actually owns this company they

176
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:32,539
own this UAV company they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

177
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:34,458
forward with or without the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FAA with or</font>

178
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,948
without the games from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

179
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,718
leaders they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move forward so</font>

180
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,338
they're moving forward for several

181
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,860
different reasons again this isn't just

182
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,839
a publicity stunt this is how they're

183
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,269
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to move packages because</font>

184
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,029
they also understand our roads are

185
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:52,160
getting more clogged our Airways are

186
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,120
getting more clogged and humans are

187
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,790
expensive

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,860
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can send this out everything that</font>

189
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do on Amazon is all connected</font>

190
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,050
already so if you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and say I</font>

191
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,480
want this package I want a hard drive

192
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:09,199
ship to me they can literally send it

193
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,970
this way and it's all automated so as

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,490
much as is there's some interesting

195
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,779
stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a stunt</font>

196
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:21,589
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at all can</font>

197
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:23,750
ring the doorbell ah well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

198
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:28,640
probably sent a signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the and</font>

199
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless doorbell so but but the</font>

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,699
challenge is is most folks out there

201
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,160
look at UAVs and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of them as</font>

202
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,380
drones with missiles on them because the

203
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,010
predator they think of them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

204
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,529
of military militarization the

205
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,540
government is spying on us the Fourth

206
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,960
Amendment issues a lot of that type of

207
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,480
stuff as when famously says get over it

208
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Fourth Amendment issues are no</font>

209
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,770
issues you've had satellites over you

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,260
for over 20 years why are you

211
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,480
complaining now because you can now see

212
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">them so it's a little bit different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,480
an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you've been hacked look</font>

214
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,790
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so who's claiming to be in</font>

215
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">charge and what has happened to</font>

216
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,140
leadership over the years the

217
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,150
interesting point is that this this is

218
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,040
really where it is right you've got

219
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,959
everybody out there whining and crying

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,610
about oversight and the government

221
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,890
wringing their hands and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else</font>

222
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,900
this is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in real society</font>

223
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,699
people are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

224
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,350
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a drone for a hundred dollars</font>

225
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,570
two hundred dollars we can fly it and

226
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,370
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they going to do the only thing</font>

227
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:41,029
that the FAA do is come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yell at you</font>

228
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,160
and threaten you with a monetary fine by

229
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,200
the way they tried this already they had

230
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman who was he was paid</font>

231
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,230
commercially to fly his UAV<font color="#CCCCCC"> overcrowd to</font>

232
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,990
take pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the UAV actually did</font>

233
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,420
end up according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FAA buzzing the</font>

234
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,580
crowd they felt that that could be

235
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,110
dangerous to the crowd so they win they

236
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,959
gave the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy a ten-thousand-dollar fine</font>

237
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:07,070
they brought it to court and the judge

238
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,619
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay mr. FAA man please explain to</font>

239
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,450
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in law policy governance this</font>

240
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:17,450
man did anything wrong uh we can't case

241
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:20,840
dismissed instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ue instead of</font>

242
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,300
the FAA just saying okay I'm gonna lick

243
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,990
my wounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go home they're actually</font>

244
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:30,079
appealing the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's your</font>

245
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">your good hard taxpayers at work so</font>

246
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,000
what's happened at leadership over the

247
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,670
years the challenge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we face right</font>

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,230
now is that things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving so fast I</font>

249
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,660
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in this room really</font>

250
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,820
believes the moral of Moore's law hasn't

251
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,250
already been broken we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving so</font>

252
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,410
quickly now that we can't afford this

253
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,500
idea of linear and authoritarian anymore

254
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,069
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work in the past we</font>

255
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,850
used to have leaders we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

256
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,280
situations that we're going to change

257
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,110
humankind and we would act and react to

258
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,720
them so we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

259
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">satellite and nuclear weapons that came</font>

260
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,640
on both events you ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

261
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,560
worldwide governance not with the

262
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,150
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and flash and stuff around in</font>

263
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,310
microseconds but you ended up with

264
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,740
worldwide governance within two years of

265
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,920
both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those events the internet</font>

266
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,080
happens is there any response from

267
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Congress is there any response from a

268
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,270
governing<font color="#CCCCCC"> body that says you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

269
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,190
guy's not trying to stop this but there

270
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">are things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that humans do for the good</font>

271
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,530
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad we just need to be able</font>

272
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,050
to get basic governance nope they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

273
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,300
said a word internet changed humankind

274
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,849
first time a politician open is not

275
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,859
about it you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to tax it the</font>

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of internets came back and said</font>

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,800
here's Bitcoin go ahead open your mouth

278
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,470
again not going to work we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

279
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">at different leadership oh so drones</font>

280
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,430
come along and they've been around 15-20

281
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,960
years depending on how you want to do

282
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,900
your calculations i actually used to

283
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,480
play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the predator in 1994 when the</font>

284
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. army</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to own it and then we had</font>

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it to the Air Force for two</font>

286
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,550
reasons one we couldn't afford it to the

287
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,770
Air Force's whining because it was a

288
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,829
fixed wing or the army<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those</font>

289
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,480
sense

290
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:18,360
okay so no offense Air Force right so

291
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,240
the challenge was was that here again is

292
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,540
a technology that's going to change in

293
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,090
kind not just UAVs but robotics<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

294
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,910
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a robot vacuum for over 12</font>

295
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,000
years so these things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

296
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,620
change human kind response from our

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,510
leadership absolutely nothing nothing so

298
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,340
we need to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking the things a</font>

299
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,010
little bit different so what I did was I

300
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,530
looked and I I was attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explore</font>

301
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,260
a new direction or a new idea and I

302
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,720
looked at the complexity leadership<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

303
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,120
complexity and I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at how</font>

304
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,950
can I actually take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from a</font>

305
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,290
mathematical equation and certain other

306
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:01,040
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually apply it to a</font>

307
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,810
leadership realm understanding that

308
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,120
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've already gone through linear</font>

309
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,979
and authoritarian and that works to a

310
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,220
point I mean it does work in the

311
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,420
military to a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now if we start</font>

312
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at non-linear non authoritarian</font>

313
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,770
self-organized entities what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

314
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,319
going to mean so can you get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

315
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,930
quick and why is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment render the</font>

316
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">DEP is Raja en de Bracy guys I'm Assaidi</font>

317
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,260
jezik special to you guys are they let

318
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,600
this go too far is my friend like a

319
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,850
prototype quadrotor now it may look like

320
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,220
something you've seen before but<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

321
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,810
me the technology in this baby isn't

322
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,000
going to be out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for at least</font>

323
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,280
another decade and he's wrong this is an

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,140
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> video azizam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and acknowledging</font>

325
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,430
may be up there right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but now we're</font>

326
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,430
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call Charlie</font>

327
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,890
now let me show you a few of the

328
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,510
features here so you'll understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

329
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:01,080
say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is truly a weapon of the future</font>

330
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,060
in the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 maybe 15</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years shoot is</font>

331
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,070
going to get very real we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

332
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pretty sophisticated warfare</font>

333
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,640
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> soldiers are going to need</font>

334
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,040
technology like this to get above the

335
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,160
combat around their enemies and get into

336
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,199
tight spaces this is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlene is</font>

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,990
unlike anything I've ever seen and I've

338
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,730
seen some<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy now most of the</font>

339
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,920
quadrotors that you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube</font>

340
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,660
are doing so pretty sophisticated

341
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,610
maneuvers and none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those toys is</font>

342
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,280
equipped with a submachine gun and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

343
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred round magazine also Charlene is</font>

344
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,600
capable of flying at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 30 miles per</font>

345
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,730
hour at altitudes of quarter mile high

346
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,520
oh and it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes one professional</font>

347
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,630
Russian this fancy targets to kill you

348
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,939
this thing in itself is pretty

349
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">impressive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a lot to cool</font>

350
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,750
features the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most impressive thing is</font>

351
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,720
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that the quadrotor</font>

352
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,370
says so the biggest benefit is getting

353
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,050
that bird's eye view of what's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front</font>

354
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,970
of you and what you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's in front</font>

355
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you maybe you don't want that in</font>

356
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,900
front of you anymore when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

357
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:07,550
Charlene over the hill what we can see

358
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,550
so see we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be hackable</font>

359
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,250
it's like we've got some obstacles

360
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,400
visitors over there let's take a closer

361
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,400
look

362
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:57,469
no I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of</font>

363
00:16:25,610 --> 00:17:01,990
those guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick them out oh the guys</font>

364
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,069
that blows out here try<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

365
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,440
so we've seen what you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lena's</font>

366
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,389
capable of doing on a recon mission now

367
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,850
let's try putting on a situation she's

368
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,709
well suited for sneaking up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to evil</font>

369
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,708
beaches and hard-to-reach places

370
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,230
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a friendship decided to</font>

371
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,690
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the dinner party and they</font>

372
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,510
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> invite you want to them grow</font>

373
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,860
up the whole bucket of gaps you'll just

374
00:17:34,510 --> 00:18:11,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to show these guys need to ask</font>

375
00:17:35,860 --> 00:18:14,260
about Charlene's that video but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how i</font>

376
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">take too much time with that will be</font>

377
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,600
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> dinner there you go we can do that</font>

378
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,510
so so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing though is you</font>

379
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,820
have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have technology like that</font>

380
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,180
slippery out there in the world it is

381
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:36,070
not sitting with the military's it's

382
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:39,520
sitting with civilians and civilians are

383
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:43,600
able to do this rather rapidly why do I

384
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,870
know that back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early 2000s I had</font>

385
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,669
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project that was requested and it was</font>

386
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looking at the world's cheapest</font>

387
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,720
sniper and it was a smaller version of

388
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you saw there and that was the</font>

389
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,930
early 2000 had a zip gun and a ccd

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,330
camera on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff was out there</font>

391
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,860
I bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all off the shelf you can</font>

392
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,710
buy all the stuff off the shelf right

393
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,570
now the challenge is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you saw</font>

394
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,960
the thing that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was no</font>

395
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,419
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no control no governance the</font>

396
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,270
issue becomes that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government is</font>

397
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,370
now so far behind the eight ball that

398
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,230
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to catch up so we need</font>

399
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,870
to draw a line in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sand and say okay</font>

400
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,700
we've already lost what are we going to

401
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,489
do to try to fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're not</font>

402
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:32,050
doing that either the UK actually came

403
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:34,780
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2000 with their own governance for</font>

404
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:38,500
uavs you will look it up online they've

405
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,280
actually updated twice since 2000<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

406
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,860
UAE government

407
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,670
I into their national airspace that's

408
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,010
how far behind we are so again time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

409
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,720
a different idea so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

410
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,270
complexity in general and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

411
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,890
the two quick definitions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

412
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,920
using when I actually did the

413
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,080
experimentation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dissertation in</font>

414
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,860
complexity theory a system can be

415
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,120
described as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of intricate</font>

416
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,000
interacting parts which together

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,280
function as a whole this interaction is

418
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,350
so intricate that cannot be predicted by

419
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,570
linear equations there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

420
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,389
variables involved that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior of</font>

421
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,760
the system can only be<font color="#CCCCCC"> understood as an</font>

422
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,520
emerging consequence of the sum of the

423
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,360
Constitution elements well i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

424
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">at there was the idea that with UAVs you</font>

425
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,540
have UAV groups you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have individual</font>

people you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments you have</font>

427
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,680
military and law enforcement you have

431
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,100
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the leadership is what</font>

432
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,580
is the government is a police force

433
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,490
allowed to use it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and</font>

434
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,460
take a suspect out yes or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is that</font>

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,710
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so linear that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all we can</font>

437
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,020
do is think<font color="#CCCCCC"> 141 it's not going to work</font>

438
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way anymore we've already proven</font>

439
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:09,340
that's not so a sample of a complex

440
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,350
complexity in action basically for I

441
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,270
know this most this crowd actually

442
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably knows all this but this was a</font>

443
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:19,930
base presentation basically you look at

444
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,150
all the way through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem for</font>

445
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,740
school<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fish is self protection of the</font>

446
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,630
smaller fish against the larger ones

447
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,270
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually want to do what's</font>

448
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vision of the school and remember</font>

449
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,879
it's a self-organized entity each each

450
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:36,250
individual fish does not have the

451
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,620
information does not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font>

452
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,430
information to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

453
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no leader there's no linear leader or</font>

454
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,490
authoritarian fish saying you will do

455
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:51,820
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all self-organized entities</font>

456
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,809
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea you know is if you look at</font>

457
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,029
this the full

458
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,710
losophy itself you move towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

459
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,480
center<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mass move in the same</font>

460
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,759
direction of the fish near you and

461
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,539
sacrifice the fish on the outer edge if

462
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,249
necessary so you start to make a

463
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:11,110
different assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> just isn't that</font>

464
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:13,480
marxism mean so so to a point if you're

465
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at schools of fish yes but I was</font>

466
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to demonstrate with simply you're</font>

467
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:22,360
moving towards a single so complex the

468
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,168
leadership method so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

469
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">method of complexity leadership itself</font>

470
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:29,740
basically you can look at it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

471
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,360
arrive<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a solution set where several</font>

stakeholders and several related

473
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,629
problems issue sets are looked at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

474
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,480
same time in a nonlinear fashion and you

475
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:41,498
can also look at them and not a flurry

476
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,230
authoritarian fashion I'll explain

477
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,639
explain that in a minute or two so on

478
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,799
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing</font>

479
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:50,549
called UAV aviators<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've I ever heard</font>

480
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:53,158
of these hoaxes their humanitarian<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

481
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:55,929
it's a self organized group

482
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,629
self-organized entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> highly</font>

483
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at them on the web</font>

484
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:03,490
very interesting group the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman who</font>

485
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,059
started it understood that UAVs were

486
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,769
nothing more than a truck for sensors

487
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:11,889
the real job of the gentleman who

488
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,389
started it is big data and what he was

489
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:17,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for was different ways to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

490
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:20,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big data be able to analyze</font>

491
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,850
it and get it back out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world well</font>

492
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,029
he did was he started this thing called

493
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:29,559
UAV aviators and it's a humanitarian a

494
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:31,480
UAV platform it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> self organized and</font>

495
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,269
what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was they actually have</font>

496
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,549
governance they have policies they have

497
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,909
rules and they have complete structure

498
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:42,009
for the entire world they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually list</font>

499
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:45,039
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> country and what every</font>

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:47,289
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> country's UAV policies are or not</font>

501
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,999
so when they fly in the country they

502
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:52,119
know how to keep out of out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble</font>

00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:57,249
again completely sub organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nepal hit</font>

506
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,389
before they set something out about

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nepal UAV aviators were already on</font>

networking looking to see who<font color="#CCCCCC"> had assets</font>

510
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,120
in the fall to be able to fly and start

511
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,150
rescue missions for hours before the the

512
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,850
new service<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have it that's the type</font>

513
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:22,060
of leadership<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at so</font>

514
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:24,639
one of the issues that the FAA has right

515
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">now is they look at different</font>

516
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,880
definitions but they also look at how do

517
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:33,520
you take UAVs and put them into the

518
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">airspace and what does that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

519
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,960
their issues that they are not

520
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,760
addressing in the policies and and other

521
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:44,020
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're putting out is the</font>

522
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,680
level of autonomous behavior so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

523
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this axis here basically you're just</font>

524
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,280
programming the machine you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> letting</font>

525
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,910
it go out and do whatever it needs to do

526
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,290
and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some interesting</font>

527
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,150
machines out there when you look at

528
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,490
trusted independent self governance and

529
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,910
minimal intervention there's actually a

530
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,190
UAV out there that can swarm there's

531
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,770
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the system itself and</font>

532
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,570
if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a goal and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it I</font>

533
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,570
want you to be a twins house at two

534
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:17,200
o'clock and it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the swarm</font>

535
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,060
ends up hitting headwinds they're smart

536
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,670
enough to know how to actually cut

537
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,530
corners in order to obtain the goal at

538
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,200
the right time they will do whatever

539
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,420
they need to do speed up use more fuel

540
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,760
whatever they have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the goal</font>

541
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:34,000
so that's the level of autonomy that's

542
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,310
out there right now the FAA is still

543
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,560
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the idea of remote-controlled</font>

544
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,230
vehicles they're still like looking at

545
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,659
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a kid</font>

546
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,820
with a joystick you know flying a bird

547
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,260
some please oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he put a camera on it</font>

548
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now I've got to worry about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth</font>

549
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">amendment we're so far beyond that that</font>

550
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,850
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to catch up now I keep</font>

551
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,280
kind of beating<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the FA a little bit</font>

552
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,610
and for full disclosure and

553
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,300
understanding i<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually did talk with</font>

554
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:07,090
the FAA mr. Williams who actually runs

555
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,700
the UAV program so the FAA got me to

556
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:11,709
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitre people and we work through</font>

557
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,140
some issues one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges</font>

558
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,940
that the FAA has is actually the

559
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,770
governance structure itself and that

560
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,640
gets back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the authoritarian the</font>

561
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,680
linear nature

562
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,020
so they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are under this thing</font>

563
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,050
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal with right now</font>

564
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,510
and it takes approximately five years

565
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,850
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arc for the aviation rules</font>

566
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,340
committee in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change one rule</font>

567
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:37,540
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aviation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community it takes</font>

568
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,879
approximately five years five years not

569
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,710
going to work Moore's Law is dead

570
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,320
already i think we're beyond the

571
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,690
five-year idea so the the challenge

572
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,980
becomes is that that all the policies

573
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,530
are things like that they're being

574
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,960
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about are down here in the manual</font>

575
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,850
remote control world or maybe simple

576
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,530
automation where you you know you can

577
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,659
jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bird in the air and on and</font>

578
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,660
automate the platform but in the real

579
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,870
world that video<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you saw from the</font>

580
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,810
good old<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian that's an older video</font>

581
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:09,370
the real world were<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the way up here</font>

582
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,530
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> says long since been blown by</font>

583
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:15,489
leadership<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blown by a long time</font>

584
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:18,760
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i created the initial vision and</font>

585
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,440
philosophy set for for the UAV issue

586
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,930
basically creating the simplest path

587
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,900
possible for the UAV community denigrate

588
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:29,350
fully into the national airspace if you

589
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,300
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the faa cares about and how</font>

590
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,250
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it one of their big</font>

591
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,389
issues of course is notice a given no

592
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:39,570
significant risk to human life well

593
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:43,360
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risks in UAVs</font>

594
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:45,460
but you can minimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> those risks in</font>

595
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,790
different ways but we have to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

596
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:51,220
think differently why do you EDS have to

597
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:53,580
use the same airport or can they how is

598
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it that we integrated balloons and</font>

599
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,740
helicopters and in gliders we've already

600
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,890
done this in the past why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UAVs</font>

601
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,370
are so much of a problem that they can't

602
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,820
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out after 15 or 20 years yes</font>

603
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:12,610
they serve interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> who you know</font>

604
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,310
for scope so the deliveries<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

605
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly valuable to communities</font>

606
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,500
relying on boats in bad weather it

607
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,919
because you can still fly pre-program a

608
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,860
dumb critical technology means just to

609
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,480
drop off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the post or something if you've</font>

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,530
the couch

613
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,600
we're in coma be precise exactly in one

614
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,970
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why I like I said I can't</font>

615
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,090
be in a PMA is that there are places in

616
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,040
the world that can see beyond the linear

617
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,480
nature of what they're trying to do but

618
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,970
our governments and our government

619
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,240
simply can't here in the US which is

620
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,630
very frustrating<font color="#E5E5E5"> because on even fedex</font>

621
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,430
and UPS they have active<font color="#E5E5E5"> UAV programs</font>

622
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,340
right now where there are actively

623
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,080
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i fly large</font>

624
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,060
amounts of cargo from here to here

625
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,760
without human intervention and without

626
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,800
having to worry about paying pilots so

627
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,540
there are people there out there that

628
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,780
that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out these</font>

629
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,940
things but without being able to to get

630
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,730
everybody on the same page it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

631
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,960
difficult and right now our our

632
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:26,030
government is just stuck so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

633
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,010
next generation system to facilitate the

634
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:31,820
process I don't know if anybody has ever

635
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:35,450
heard of ads-b ads-b is actually the

636
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:38,210
system where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS instead of</font>

637
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:42,890
our current<font color="#CCCCCC"> airways that system is over</font>

10 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind and again somehow that's</font>

639
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:49,040
okay where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leadership how is it</font>

640
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we went from a nuclear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blast to two</font>

641
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,020
years the entire world<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on the same</font>

642
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,430
page yet an issue like this that is so

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,950
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our economies and</font>

00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:03,230
everything else is sitting languishing

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:06,110
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years behind so again getting</font>

646
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:09,230
back to the idea of you know a few

647
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ideas on things many people</font>

648
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that decentralization means the</font>

649
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,990
loss of control that's simply not true

650
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,330
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve control if you look at</font>

651
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,730
control as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of events and not</font>

652
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,669
people and that's where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

653
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,440
of that is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

654
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,680
controlling the events not necessarily

655
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,720
the people and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more people you</font>

656
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,510
have controlling events the more people

657
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have that care about controlling</font>

658
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,160
those events more people that you have

659
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,860
proactively working to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorable</font>

660
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,560
events the more control you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font>

661
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,860
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization this is nonlinear</font>

662
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,860
thought

663
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,610
so the scope of the project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

664
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:54,000
for my dissertation basically i looked

665
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:56,699
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at mainly leadership</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did not</font>

666
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,740
look at technology specific because we

667
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,990
already know the UAV in a manned

668
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,700
aircraft to fly in the same space that's

669
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue that comes down to people</font>

670
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">in leadership</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually looked at</font>

671
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:09,270
different different things I did limited

672
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,490
to the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> airspace only because I was</font>

673
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. governance</font>

674
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,110
issues that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have out there and then I</font>

675
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,020
based it on you know let reviews and

676
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:22,290
other things but I did go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

677
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,840
rather interesting to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and do</font>

678
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,270
the interviews or the dissertation I

679
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,010
ended up talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 subject matter</font>

680
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,710
experts on this which took me a long

681
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:35,520
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's hard to find 20</font>

682
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,950
actual experts on these these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

683
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,740
ended up talking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's actually</font>

684
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,300
interesting to find out which direction

685
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,610
that they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in going</font>

686
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,919
most of them understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonlinear non</font>

687
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:49,800
authoritarian and they were good with

688
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:54,300
that self-organizing entities started

689
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:57,540
making them a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little uneasy and then</font>

690
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:00,330
some people when they were were talked

691
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,100
to they actually looked more at their

692
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,820
own pocketbook and what it would do to

693
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:10,050
them personally and their company and

694
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,450
that's an issue so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a huge</font>

695
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,770
disconnected definitions and I also find

696
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,770
that out through the research and

697
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:20,940
talking to the FAA and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other folks right</font>

698
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:24,180
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we use the word drone UAVs</font>

699
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:27,660
unmanned air systems everybody's got a

700
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,780
different term and that confuses the

701
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:36,750
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that also confuses of the</font>

702
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:41,220
solutions correct so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets back</font>

703
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the autonomous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so you can look</font>

704
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,810
at a drone as more of an autonomous

705
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,610
vehicle versus a UAV which is an

706
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,010
unmanned air vehicle which is more

707
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,169
controlled by human with a certain level

708
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,480
of autonomy<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it so there are different</font>

709
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones but the challenge is is there</font>

710
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,990
between the media and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FAA doesn't</font>

711
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,129
help because it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually give</font>

712
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,900
these definitions when

713
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,060
they when they put out these press

714
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,460
releases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges that the media</font>

715
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:09,240
puts out a lot of stuff out there and so

716
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,570
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the predator UAV way back</font>

717
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,790
when and now it's used for a lot of

718
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,340
drone strikes so now they use drone

719
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,409
strike so they've actually changed that

720
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,870
without explaining to people with the

721
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,150
difference was so the difference with

722
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,870
the predator itself is used to have a

723
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:29,520
pilot who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicated to jet flying the</font>

724
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,709
vehicle and then you have a payload

725
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,860
person and then you had a weapons person

726
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,380
those lines are being blurred a little

727
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,270
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and now you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability</font>

728
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,550
to actually make the predator on

729
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,950
autonomous vehicle in a lot of ways and

730
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,930
basically just monitor it we monitor it

731
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,330
because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hundred percent sure</font>

732
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,670
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can trust the vehicles and</font>

733
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:54,000
also because right now we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

734
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,850
to give a computer the ability to do a

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,290
kinetic<font color="#CCCCCC"> start I think we will them at</font>

736
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:04,649
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point actually I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

737
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:06,780
making that far off so so what i did was

738
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,740
i looked at the UAV integration as a

739
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:12,120
complexity network and i started to

740
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:17,428
discuss this with the FAA and a few

741
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:20,190
other people the UAV communities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

742
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,230
drone user groups and other people

743
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,060
they're out there and one of the things

744
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found is is that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now the</font>

745
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,549
way that the aviation rules committee

746
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:31,290
works everybody has a say so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go</font>

747
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,740
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for public comment everybody has a</font>

748
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,870
say well we've got the FCC right here if

749
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,060
you actually track back to what they're

750
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,560
they're concerned with do they really

751
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about air worthiness of an aircraft</font>

752
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,000
probably don't so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a</font>

753
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,909
vote why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they in the middle of all</font>

754
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,860
of this that usually radio people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

755
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,560
only control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radio frequency though</font>

756
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:58,920
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control you know how many how</font>

757
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,980
many threads i have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold right so why</font>

758
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,930
are they in true it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges is</font>

759
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,640
there in here because we've always had

760
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,040
them in here because our governance

761
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,930
structure from<font color="#CCCCCC"> constitution forward is</font>

762
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,930
always that our governance<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure is</font>

763
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,808
linear and authoritarian

764
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,629
if your frequencies interfere with my

765
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:20,670
garage<font color="#CCCCCC"> door opener I'm gonna have an</font>

766
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,940
issue so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FC has been part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

767
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:26,369
correct but they have they have that

768
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,380
that has to do the radio frequencies but

769
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:31,140
not how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many threads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have on a bolt on</font>

770
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,520
a wing right knocking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so they</font>

771
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,410
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in that part but they will</font>

772
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,300
come in on the frequency part so they

773
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,700
have to be parted part in the discussion

774
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are sorry that is</font>

775
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,359
going to group on this frequency for

776
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Curtis so they're allowed but they're</font>

777
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:50,279
allowed right now to actually comment on

778
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:52,740
all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> no expertise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly so this is</font>

779
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,619
actually a mind map from mitre and this

780
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,649
is what the FAA is looking at when they

781
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">were attempting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out policy the</font>

782
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,369
major difference is that in the middle

783
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:05,819
of this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about community</font>

784
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,130
outcomes the routine of UAS Unmanned air

785
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:09,900
systems which is different than what the

786
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,619
fááá was talking about with<font color="#E5E5E5"> unmanned air</font>

787
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:17,130
vehicles and drones and these folks work

788
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:20,309
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MA UAS integration into</font>

789
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,079
non-segregated civilian airspace they

790
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:25,290
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at different ways</font>

791

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate but not integrate so if</font>

792
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,980
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of nowhere is it</font>

793
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually integrating into the air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

National Airspace sitting over the ocean

795
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,910
it's probably not really integrating

796
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:38,819
into the national airspace so even the

797
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:41,940
folks that are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these their</font>

798
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:43,950
ends up being a disconnect so who

799
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,829
actually there's a lot of questions out

800
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,770
there for this these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some</font>

801
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:54,569
teaser questions for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh who owns it</font>

802
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,599
so who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> a UAV it transitions over</font>

803
00:36:54,569 --> 00:37:01,859
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your house who owns the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">airspace none right now the FAA says</font>

805
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:09,210
they do do you agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it there's yes</font>

806
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,299
its a good application for<font color="#E5E5E5"> LT to inspect</font>

807
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,700
groups and survive become cheaper

808
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:16,230
exactly the current policy though<font color="#E5E5E5"> theme</font>

809
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,808
is trying to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that activity</font>

810
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,010
for commercial use without because they

811
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,290
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy to address that</font>

812
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,730
that's a significant problem for you and

813
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">your folks and disaster recovery for</font>

814
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,490
example where can you assess it down the

815
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,810
structure right now

816
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,970
we're using torsional overhead imagery

817
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,040
to do this that's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 meter</font>

he was young like them a little things

00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:43,950
like this yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why the UK has</font>

822
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:59,819
also used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh for inspecting</font>

823
00:37:46,710 --> 00:38:01,920
smokestacks cooling towers so so the FCC

824
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,740
has the ability to control all<font color="#E5E5E5"> Airways</font>

825
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,190
the FAA can tell you what happens with

826
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aircraft themselves but they work</font>

827
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,430
together when you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

828
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,380
radios and frequencies and certain like

829
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,319
things like that but the challenge is

830
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,600
the bandwidth has opened up we sold more

831
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,960
of the bandwidth and but we're behind

832
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and things like a dsb so we're selling</font>

833
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,270
more of the bandwidth to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

834
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:33,270
for commercial use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS but we're</font>

835
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,430
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80s be so the FAA is still</font>

836
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,650
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play catch-up when it comes to</font>

837
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:40,290
this stuff of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC in order to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

838
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:44,400
able to get off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our old frequencies</font>

839
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:46,230
and and of flying the needles so they do

840
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,970
work with each other but the challenge

841
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:54,119
is is should the FAA allow the FCC to

842
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,939
come in and stop a policy that has to do

843
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,460
with airworthiness one has nothing to do

844
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,710
really with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other but right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

845
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,600
way it's written there are there's a lot

846
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,210
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with comments</font>

847
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,710
and stop where they may not want to do

848
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to go a little bit</font>

849
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,810
more non authoritarian and be able to

850
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">have more groups look at it instead of</font>

851
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">just individuals who have their own</font>

852
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,280
budgets and their own you know rice

853
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,740
bowls to worry about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a matter of</font>

854
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,420
checks and balances or is it just well

855
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,250
that's the way we've always the matter

856
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,890
of separation of separation of

857
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,030
authorities and the matter of Chloe

858
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,190
we've always thought and rice bowls rice

859
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,280
bowls is a big part of this so who owns

860
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,239
it solutions if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at political</font>

861
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,029
borders ownership certain things like

862
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,769
that we have an issue not just in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font>

863
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:48,069
but around the world where we have not

864
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:51,069
defined this very well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

865
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:54,129
lack of leadership on this issue uh when

866
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:58,869
a UAV when a predator UAV went over into

867
00:39:54,129 --> 00:40:01,509
Iran accidentally you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacked this course</font>

868
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:04,479
was accidentally let alone when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

869
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:07,449
accidentally done is it an act of war<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

870
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:11,348
act of aggression or simply an accident

871
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:13,059
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would so well</font>

872
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:18,789
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference though our</font>

873
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:21,699
predators are armed there you go so

874
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:24,759
here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that Iran said that</font>

875
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:27,009
it was an act of aggression headed

876
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:29,259
towards an act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> war as they started to</font>

877
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:31,539
light up their missile base right the

878
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:35,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. is standing back going guys guys</font>

879
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:36,609
guys we're just screw-ups hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

880
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,419
that's giving me confidence as an

881
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:42,879
American citizen<font color="#E5E5E5"> with we're incompetent</font>

882
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:45,638
to fly them okay I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really happy</font>

883
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:47,739
about that answer either but the

884
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,229
challenge is because we haven't actually

885
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,899
had definitions and we're not on the

886
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:55,118
same page anybody can decide what they

887
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:57,249
wanted to it means whatever they want it

888
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,129
to me so they have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

889
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:02,348
literally go out and start launching

890
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:04,868
because we made a mistake was a mistake

891
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:07,959
or not if we use that Lana logic though

892
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:11,679
doesn't that allow Russia and China to

893
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:15,249
fly UAVs and our airspace if we had

894
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:17,439
governance it wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have existing</font>

895
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:19,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">open skies deconfliction mechanisms for</font>

896
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:21,939
reconnaissance activity we have existing

897
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:25,419
mechanisms for error intercept air

898
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:27,428
defense identification mandates<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

899
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:28,868
cover a range of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities we</font>

900
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:31,539
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same structure in the</font>

901
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:34,449
drawing board right so no and that's

902
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:37,569
exactly it but here's the thing is this

903
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:39,569
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had legislation</font>

904
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:41,949
on years ago they never went anywhere

905
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:44,319
with the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> journaling issue with the</font>

906
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:46,779
UL white house right so you had an issue

907
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,839
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> year a couple years ago where</font>

908
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:51,729
we have we kept having Cessnas break the

909
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,080
barrier over near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House and</font>

910
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:56,810
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> started having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

911
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,380
Jerome that did it right well years ago

912
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,940
I went to the Air Force<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I say guys</font>

913
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,200
we need to at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least start to look at</font>

914
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,540
this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different and there</font>

915
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,549
they oh no no it's perfect perfect I

916
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,310
said okay guys let's look at this

917
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,710
logically right now everything you do is

918
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on human intimidation that's not</font>

919
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,290
true<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so when a aircraft flies</font>

920
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,180
towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House a little</font>

921
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,190
sergeant usually who's watching the

922
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,859
scope see something that shouldn't be

923
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,800
there he just opens up an SOP book

924
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:30,140
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hail all frequencies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

925
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,150
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the UAV number to</font>

926
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,150
tell your boss he's going to scramble

927
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,940
you

928
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,790
this I understand what that means the

929
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,980
UAV there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way to intimidate now</font>

930
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,270
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gonna do well the general</font>

931
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to at the time oh</font>

932
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,440
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shoot it down I said</font>

933
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,020
really I said his<font color="#E5E5E5"> balsa wouldn't a</font>

934
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,940
snowmobile engine I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your radar</font>

935
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,770
is tuned to fall so would in a

936
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,900
snowmobile engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not</font>

937
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:06,210
enjoy recover either exactly can't get

938
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,430
our captor either and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said no it's not</font>

939
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:10,290
I said now what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to do</font>

940
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:14,089
since you can't lock missiles on this

941
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:17,520
thing oh I'm in hopping guns oh really

942
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you live in a CNN world every single</font>

943
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,050
round you pickled off of that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

944
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,310
dead grandmother or a dead baby doesn't

945
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,010
matter if you get the side of a mountain

946
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">a CNN it'll be a dead grandmother a dead</font>

947
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,430
baby right so you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

948
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,160
that I said general that's all I'm

949
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,609
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do is start to think what</font>

950
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you going to do in the eventualities</font>

951
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,910
the eventualities was we agreed to

952
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:43,910
disagree because he was a general and I

953
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:46,379
was an idiot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not matter so do</font>

954
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,480
like a public road<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're looking at the</font>

955
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">baghdad premiere around earlier there</font>

956
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,220
was zero discussion for a very long time

957
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:55,410
about how to maintain the<font color="#CCCCCC"> airspace</font>

958
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,939
against drugs we had every other kind of

959
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,220
defense we had all these air defense

960
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,410
assets hang on but nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to deal</font>

961
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,350
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own problem is oh well we</font>

962
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:07,200
weren't seeing it except we were so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

963
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:10,319
the challenge was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended</font>

964
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,359
up sending a follow-up email I basically

965
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:17,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked at least start to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

966
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,780
idea can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a net on a c-130 to get</font>

967
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,300
it what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do because</font>

968
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,830
general both of your ideas to me could

969
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">have actually helped the enemy because</font>

970
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,520
you don't know is there bugs and gas on

971
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,150
that thing if you hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did you now</font>

972
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,680
just become the dispersing device huh I

973
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:35,130
never got an email back I don't know why

974
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,790
um I was I was surprised I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

975
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,530
email back so some of the electronics

976
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,170
that are out there right you've got

977
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,670
direct energy protection you incorporate

978
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,520
some of the stuff in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aircraft now</font>

979
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,200
right all this stuff is great but again

980
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,300
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going to do against UAVs</font>

981
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,819
there's actually a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> mirage chip</font>

982
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,290
some folks may know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's very</font>

983
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive chip it's about a hundred</font>

984
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,900
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

985
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,760
chip but it's a mirage chip and it

986
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,950
actually makes things disappear because

987
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,770
it makes it blends it into its

988
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:08,319
environment so you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a UAV</font>

989
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:10,720
and start putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quiet stuff on</font>

990
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,570
blended into into its background

991
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,310
surroundings it's going to go away

992
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:17,260
there's also something out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

993
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:20,009
was called the John Wayne rifle at one

994
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:24,070
point and the idea behind that was that

995
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:26,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">if if the sensor could actually see you</font>

996
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,750
one time it would actually paint you and

997
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,180
no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you went behind the pole</font>

998
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and came back it would not shoot until</font>

999
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,890
it saw you again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't waste</font>

1000
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,260
ammunition so it would actually paint

you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could put this this type of</font>

1002
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,340
stuff on UAVs as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

1003
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,670
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest to</font>

1004
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,160
this crowd here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing you can hack</font>

1005
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,950
these things they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked the</font>

1006
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,029
down the down links have been hacked for

1007
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,609
the predator the hunter UAV was actually

1008
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:01,240
on the open Internet it was using an 802

1009
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:05,230
11 protocol and it was it was on the

1010
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:07,629
open net so the stuff that the military

1011
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:10,990
birds are supposed to be seeing which

1012
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:13,930
should be semi protected or classified

1013
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,189
is actually in the open and now we're

1014
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,529
only getting to the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

1015
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:19,470
starting to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm what happens when</font>

1016
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,530
they actually hacked the aircraft itself

1017
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:26,680
now they own it do I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care if if I</font>

1018
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:28,150
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sensor itself well if I</font>

1019
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,940
can use the sensor it'd be kind of cool

1020
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,910
it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun but I'd really rather on the</font>

1021
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,850
aircraft because now I own at all it's

1022
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:39,670
out there um so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

1023
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,400
different things there for those you

1024
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,710
create a targetable a common operational

1025
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,840
picture with some of this stuff with

1026
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,940
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to do with UAVs is</font>

1027
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,800
kind of lift the fog of<font color="#CCCCCC"> war but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1028
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually can create more in the fog of</font>

1029
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,770
war if we don't fail in a situation

1030
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,660
where they're secure so that's basically

1031
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,280
where we're at applying complexity

1032
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">leadership theory to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drawing the</font>

1033
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,600
airspace and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grayson and this is where</font>

1034
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,990
the fááá is right now they're getting

1035
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,630
swallowed up by a civilian drones into

1036
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:18,279
that airspace

1037
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:20,410
and so did this is actually a draft of

1038
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,690
the front of the book cover the book

1039
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:25,330
comes out in July and that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

1040
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">got on that one questions all right so</font>

1041
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:33,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you governance</font>

1042
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:36,610
issue with the u.s. makeup of it being

1043
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:38,620
deliberately<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow with the opposite end</font>

1044
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,830
of the technology going extremely fast

1045
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:44,440
where is that balancing point to be able

1046
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to effect that we're not rushing to that</font>

1047
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:50,920
creating bad policy that has a lasting

1048
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,860
effect so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you have to</font>

1049
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at certain things and although I</font>

1050
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,960
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the balancing act I think at</font>

1051
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,490
some point you have to hold somebody

1052
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,420
accountable and somebody speak to the

1053
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:06,700
fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years is not a balancing act 20</font>

1054
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,910
years is an abomination against my

1055
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:12,879
government and yet nobody in the FDA is

1056
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:15,549
being held to account to anything at all

1057
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,340
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where we have to look</font>

1058
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,140
the idea that yes we are slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1059
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,120
deliberate on purpose and the

1060
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,580
Constitution<font color="#E5E5E5"> was set up that we would</font>

1061
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this interaction and that we would</font>

1062
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,960
have minified every now and then and

1063
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,850
disagreement and that things would be

1064
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,700
done slow because we were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1065
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,049
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people by the people who thinks</font>

1066
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a government for the</font>

1067
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,670
people by the people anymore if you do

1068
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,920
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me afterwards I was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a ways</font>

1069
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,470
and means committee the other day and I

1070
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">will change your opinion about Robert</font>

1071
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,339
Martha Wayne had said the voting would

1072
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,280
make a difference they wouldn't let us

1073
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,290
do it there you go so so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1074
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,720
have right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we do have a balancing</font>

1075
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,270
act of it but the challenge is is that

1076
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,009
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is moving so fast that we</font>

1077
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,740
have to start looking at a different

1078
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,270
form of leadership itself not saying

1079
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,069
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Constitution</font>

1080
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">way or anything like that we'd have to</font>

1081
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">start looking at the idea that linear</font>

1082
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,390
and authoritarian will not function in

1083
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,820
society today it won't you tell these

1084
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,620
kids right now not to do something it's

1085
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work right now you tell</font>

1086
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,609
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go out and you tell the kid</font>

1087
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:26,180
don't fly that you EV by though so

1088
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:28,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> posted coming in they it's</font>

1089
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,739
not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much as questioning why they</font>

1090
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:31,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">questioning the authority they want to</font>

1091
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:35,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what understand why they're doing</font>

1092
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:38,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">what but if you just put the hammer down</font>

1093
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:40,399
they shut down they're gone exactly and

1094
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,319
they and the the challenge there though

1095
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,319
is is that even some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1096
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:47,808
I interviewed for my dissertation the

1097
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:50,150
reason why they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not want integration</font>

1098
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:52,519
was because their company would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt</font>

1099
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,489
tell these kids today that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

1100
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,890
because I I want more profit and I want

1101
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,440
you to lose profit watch how fast

1102
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,150
they're going to change if we it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1103
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,480
a different idea just out of interest

1104
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:09,829
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was senses of excellence in the US</font>

1105
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,539
for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research so I'm</font>

1106
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:12,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">answered question to deploys because</font>

1107
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:15,249
there's actually two different senders

1108
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:18,859
come on there is a center for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> EV</font>

1109
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:21,980
research under the US military and we

1110
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:26,509
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those drone centers and</font>

1111
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:30,009
then we have the FAA centers now the FAA

1112
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:33,440
gave out five licenses for centers

1113
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:35,359
Alaska Virginia everything else what

1114
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,089
they didn't do was give any money for

1115
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:41,930
them so what they did was they said you

1116
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:44,538
as an individual as a business owner I'm

1117
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FAA your business owner you want to</font>

1118
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:50,390
use your UAV for commercial purposes I

1119
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:53,808
said no you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well how do I do</font>

1120
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:56,779
it I said go to go to a UAV<font color="#E5E5E5"> center of</font>

1121
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:59,329
excellence in Virginia great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go down</font>

1122
00:50:56,779 --> 00:51:01,069
ok I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test this because I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1123
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:04,190
use it for real estate or I want to use

1124
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:06,230
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever the center looks and</font>

1125
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,089
says that's awesome you've got all this

1126
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,099
paperwork and this data on the stuff

1127
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:11,989
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that's great we just</font>

1128
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:15,230
need a half a million dollars or so to

1129
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:17,299
test your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ear so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm testament is</font>

1130
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,180
almost the sum of the American composite

1131
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:22,160
just they arguing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's as how</font>

1132
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,359
mention I'll put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Twitter</font>

1133
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:29,058
stream 2015 but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan the news</font>

1134
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:32,480
especially when if the same issues if

1135
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:34,640
you can't find more is correct and

1136
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,049
that's actually why South America is

1137
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,519
becoming big you

1138
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:41,029
because they have the governance is

1139
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:44,928
becoming big and again America is

1140
00:51:41,029 --> 00:51:46,910
struggling economically as much as folks

we're struggling economically the last

00:51:50,029 --> 00:51:53,359
time that we struggled economically like

1144
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,359
this the only thing that really brought

doing pretty well most of the other ones

though are hurting so badly for cash

1159
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:32,719
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably close up and they just</font>

1160
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:35,629
won't be there so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how far behind</font>

1161
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:39,469
we are so oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm getting the hurry</font>

1162
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:41,599
up so we all love to laugh at the amazon

1163
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:43,670

1164
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,609
back porch in certain places in this

1165
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:49,549
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's a lot more likely</font>

1166
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:52,279
that there's a guy on the back porch of

1167
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:54,079
his house sit there with a shotgun skin

1168
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:56,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">with another crushes one of these things</font>

1169
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">day I don't have to license well you</font>

1170
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:00,199
wanted to know let alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

1171
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:02,539
you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the civilian drones the</font>

1172
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:04,459
issue of surveilling other people in

1173
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:06,170
your neighborhood for<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like that</font>

1174
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:08,089
so ownership you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

1175
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:10,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other borders but it's also in your</font>

1176
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in terms of property</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rights you</font>

1177
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:16,249
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I declare my ranch a no-fly</font>

1178
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:18,349
zone for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s well I'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

1179
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:21,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the answer to that of the FAA is 20</font>

1180
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:23,959
years behind is<font color="#E5E5E5"> their blunder taste is</font>

1181
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:26,538
there any like height restriction Sodor

1182
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:29,959
so again depending on how you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1183
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:32,839
interpret<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law there is 500 feet is</font>

1184
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:35,299
one of them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you read</font>

1185
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:37,729
so I'm a helicopter and fixed-wing pilot

1186
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:39,529
so my fixed wing license says that I

1187
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:42,109
have to stay above this I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all</font>

1188
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">these other stuff my helicopter license</font>

1189
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,759
says do everything opposite what the

1190
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:49,550
fixed-wing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense is so if you actually</font>

1191
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:51,230
look at it UAVs you can

1192
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:54,100
you can put certain restrictions on them

1193
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,540
but then you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look right now</font>

1194
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,520
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that's out there</font>

1195
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,190
and how law enforcement because again

1196
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,230
you start shooting and somebody from law

1197
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:06,080
enforcement can show up right now what

1198
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:08,810
they're saying is the nuisance and and

1199
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,819
it's a variance it's a nuisance<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

1200
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:12,650
and it's within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law under the</font>

1201
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,980
nuisance laws but here's the thing it's

1202
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:18,290
an attribution issue now right so if you

1203
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,180
call law enforcement and I've got a UAV

1204
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it zips away because it sees the</font>

1205
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:25,460
police car come up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

1206
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,740
tribution who knows who bought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1207
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,840
again this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where what I'm</font>

1208
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,299
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw the idea out</font>

1209
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,540
there that the old leadership will no

1210
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:38,150
longer work because if if the FAA 20

1211
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,580
years ago had even started one piece of

1212
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:42,440
paper 20 years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had built it to</font>

1213
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:44,870
the point even where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UK has it now</font>

1214
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,790
you have to register there are certain

1215
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you have to do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

1216
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,600
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so here extend will go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

1217
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,380
a UAV and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get some really cool</font>

1218
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:56,509
pictures of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your the house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

1219
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,350
think wins throwing me off so if any

1220
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,350
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions let me know</font>
