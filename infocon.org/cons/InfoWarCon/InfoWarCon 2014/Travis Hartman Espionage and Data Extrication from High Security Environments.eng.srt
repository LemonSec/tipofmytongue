1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,719
our next speaker and we're going to

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,280
evolve into<font color="#CCCCCC"> evening and we've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,200
couple schedule changes is that you

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,439
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend some world coxon ticket</font>

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,029
he was in DC he works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> exelon power</font>

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,310
company and we just heard word<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoops</font>

7
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:25,320
can't and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to press whys</font>

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,509
and wherefores from him but the power

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,939
companies do what they do so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,880
changing things a little bit and from

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,230
l-3<font color="#E5E5E5"> communications Travis Hartman I was</font>

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,700
not formally I'm a schedule but we

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,500
evolved a min because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,079
that is just so cool and I really like

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,780
the concept of data exfiltration so we

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,190
moved him<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this morning from when</font>

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,899
when the Swedes we're doing their things

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,589
we took some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now it's all</font>

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,920
working out so Travis understands this

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,379
stuff like really really well I've heard

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you I've researched you okay I</font>

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your teachers from grade</font>

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,349
school I know all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know still</font>

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,030
let me in your house I hope you don't

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:12,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a beer if you can do is demo you</font>

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:14,760
need a beer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> regret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm oh yes</font>

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:21,359
before the evening devolves a little bit

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:24,270
more so one you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say thank you to</font>

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
Pete Portman he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here he is a</font>

30
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,658
person that as I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with the theory</font>

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,450
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> built out how everything needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,710
work and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I got him I'm</font>

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,780
gonna put it somewhere guys for a while

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,770
and he built the air contraction they

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,509
will be seeing just a little while so

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,250
one of the interesting challenges when

37
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,930
is talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is how people were</font>

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,390
signed up for info work on and then

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,890
things have happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were told</font>

40
00:01:44,390 --> 00:02:01,110
no you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to go talk about</font>

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:02:02,820
different things oh yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be a</font>

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">little kludgy here on picking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cruises</font>

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,130
all right yeah

44
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,410
I actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and think</font>

45
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,180
it a night our clearance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all my</font>

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,500
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> my presentation so that I'm</font>

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,150
allowed to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything right</font>

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it's more than able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

49
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,459
about taking data out of virtual desktop

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,769
infrastructure you can do that as long

51
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,290
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't use any special code you</font>

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,880
don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that's illegal and</font>

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,929
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that some commonly</font>

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,329
average people might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what</font>

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's it do it to the screen</font>

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:45,300
already yes so and I also say that as

57
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,170
part of this process I managed to

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,060
expense a drinking bird so 15 billion

59
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,260
dollar company and I expensed a drinky

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,470
bird beyond anything else I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,480
a pretty good accomplishment so what I

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,100
wanted to do is I was going through the

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,799
scenario i got like what's this common

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,690
individual yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be getting</font>

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,090
some audience interaction feedback with

66
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,220
this most of you watch James Bond movies

67
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,320
growing up your doctor know whatever

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,930
else various spy movies in the 60s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

69
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,850
70s and of course they have to get into

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,410
building or they slip away from the

71
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">dinner party and they open up the file</font>

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,519
cabinet got the camera and they're

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking my picture so you can get the doc</font>

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,959
mad so anyway there is James Bond I

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,269
really think he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a script kitty will</font>

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,799
get your boat at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end some of the</font>

77
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">background of course high alcohol</font>

78
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,810
tolerance well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that in generally</font>

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,899
fits with the computer security

80
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:43,890
community and made the phrase a few

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">times that top hackers like top dragster</font>

82
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,609
is worth best when they're

83
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:54,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">alcohol-fueled but you also notice a</font>

84
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">James Bond and where's Wayne hiding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

85
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had the the following career of</font>

86
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,720
annoying the host of hacker jeopardy

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,280
curse you Trebek but you know yet he was

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,459
an extrovert and of course he was

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:14,160
getting all this technology for Q so not

90
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,290
much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heck but the guy who always</font>

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,579
had a solution to every problem whatever

100
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,800
have a drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your hand on my desk but</font>

101
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:54,860
this is the scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have so</font>

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,759
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> an acquaintance's house one day</font>

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,770
somebody mentions they've seen this

104
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,050
document at their office it proves

105
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,639
aliens exist they're like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font>

106
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,370
this document in but share with the

107
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,409
world that aliens exist try to get this

108
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,440
scenario the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew post-snowden was</font>

109
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:13,650
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but the employer they've got</font>

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,789
a vdi they got like Citrix something

111
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,590
like that where they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in</font>

112
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct the documents but they had</font>

113
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">made their following industry best</font>

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,270
practices it says you shall not print

115
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,479
locally you cannot save the document

116
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,568
work so how can we get this document out

117
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that corporate protected sandbox so</font>

118
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:33,569
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the aliens exist to</font>

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,370
the rest of the world and we're all

120
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:38,159
hanging around we've been watching the

121
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">game it's a bunch of guys or gals who</font>

122
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:43,560
ever play they got the common stuff you

123
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,869
might find with a gamer laying around

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:54,080
the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got their xbox 360 they've</font>

125
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:54,080
got whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> else going on so</font>

126
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,330
or some the items keyboards arrays got a

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,650
keyboard for computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the nice</font>

128
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,840
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit programmable you can</font>

129
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,609
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and hit one button it</font>

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,729
will record a series of keystrokes that

131
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,990
becomes useful later on the presentation

132
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">gamepad to actually have one goes over</font>

133
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,610
here pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> it around so like specialized</font>

134
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,860
keyboards so if you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a game</font>

135
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,470
watered or else you can have a bunch of

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,270
macros or functions assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keys so</font>

137
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,600
it will do different things including

138
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,979
mouse clicks different movements<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide</font>

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,080
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of combinations you can have it</font>

140
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,540
set to where they'll just keep repeating

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,280
or it only happened one time and what's

142
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,930
nice on this one in particular there

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,270
were a lot of reviews on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon from</font>

144
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,710

yes this is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the diagram</font>

ultimately if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this well</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be showing up on a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">or an Android phone whatever else and</font>

208
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,130
mostly familiar that there's a couple

<font color="#CCCCCC">buttons you can press at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

you take a screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great we</font>

211
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,910
looked at are there some different

212
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,349
applications out there there are few

213
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,589
applications that will automatically

214
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,910
take a screenshot on<font color="#CCCCCC"> certification</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

215
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,470
I thought it'd be really nice if I had

216
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,140
an application running that I could say

217
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,120
take a screenshot once every 30 seconds

218
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then all I have to do is automate</font>

219
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,980
the scrolling through my documents and I

220
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:07,579
can then have a series of images<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

221
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,100
everything in the document another thing

222
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,150
we discussed was how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we maybe do a</font>

223
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,640
video so if I've got one screen or I'm

224
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,550
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to take screenshots</font>

225
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,400
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have an hdmi output i could run</font>

226
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that capture card record a</font>

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,730
video of scrolling through that document

228
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,430
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to extract let's say one</font>

229
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,190
frame every 15 seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> that correlates</font>

230
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:34,239
to one page and that will get stitched

231
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:37,330
together so we looked at the on device

232
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,160
capture the remote capture remote

233
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,040
captured we really can't how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

234
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,380
that well nice thing in case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or</font>

235
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,939
we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one tablet I'll</font>

236
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,650
be fine a two tablets together I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

237
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,810
have the top one going with facetime on

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple somebody have a remote end</font>

elsewhere by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time across multiple</font>

244
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,819
though i know there's maybe this device

245
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,180
on top that's face time to

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,470
something else if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get all the words</font>

247
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,560
through apple I still don't know that

248
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an external video feed so</font>

249
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:24,579
very nice from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoiding some of the</font>

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and show one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Legos and whenever we break later I'll</font>

254
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,050
give everybody a chance to come up take

255
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,420
a look at it and poke at it product the

256
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,969
camera on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably like an eight</font>

258
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,290
poor quality nothing big on it and what

259
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,120
this does when it runs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to do</font>

260
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,890
two different things one is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

261
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,080
take a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and then it's going</font>

262
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,420
to use the robotic arm to advance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

263
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,210
next page take a picture advance to the

264
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,560
next page and when it gets done on the

265
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,060
folder on the SD card i now have

266
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,390
pictures and every page on that document

267
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,670
so everything that that 65 person was

268
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,439
doing we don't have to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party</font>

269
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,479
we're still drinking wine and whatever

you know

278
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,009
this fits the toy somebody might have

279
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,559
laying around this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lego</font>

you may notice there's an extra wire

here this wire is actually a ground wire

285
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:50,559
this has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the capacitance for the</font>

286
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,839
finger that's touching the screen where

287
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,059
we got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finger or the little</font>

288
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">rubber ball thing just went to any</font>

289
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,499
conference where there's vendors doing

290
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,329
their handouts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've walked up to it</font>

291
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:05,109
both hey we have that and they're sure

292
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,488
and so once again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a vendor</font>

293
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:09,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">tchotchke it wasn't anything we had to</font>

294
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:12,879
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and it was just a Babel touch</font>

295
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,559
the info absolutely and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having a</font>

296
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,869
little problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the the grounding on</font>

297
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,959
it right now I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a video when that</font>

298
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:22,419
shows kind of from the top down with the

299
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,159
page turning and everything I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

300
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you in court with the</font>

301
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,869
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> information see this arm terms</font>

302
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,449
that does take a picture and the other

303
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:33,059
arm goes advances the page it will

304
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:35,228
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that throughout the dock</font>

305
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,379
we could actually have it going quite a

306
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:42,999
bit faster but we have a go pretty

307
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">slowly just for the demo purposes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the</font>

308
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:52,350
heck is an app for that yes so if we

309
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raining yes</font>

310
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,279
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's very long having the</font>

311
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:02,799
phrase a prince or isn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

312
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,869
so some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

313
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,149
is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing our so the testing like</font>

314
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:10,779
using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gamepad the windows and mac</font>

315
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:12,189
key sequences um what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows real easy</font>

316
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,689
you do all print screen and you're

317
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:15,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a picture of that current window</font>

318
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,599
that you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at with mac if</font>

319
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,489
you're going to take a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

320
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,079
specific window there was actually

321
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:22,059
having to click on that video after the

322
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">heat supports so I made it a little bit</font>

323
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complicated also for doing screen</font>

324
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,589
captures whether it's from VDI or using

325
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,749
the camera like that the screen

326
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:36,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolution actually had an impact so if</font>

327
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're running a giant image full screen</font>

328
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:40,839
you're doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshots off that</font>

329
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:42,499
later when you go to merge them into the

330
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,699
document may have

331
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:45,709
trouble with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the borders things</font>

332
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:50,899
overlapping and flew into some OCR

333
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:53,209
challenges we get right into some

334
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,049
applications depending on what you're

335
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:58,638
actually doing that they will block

336
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,679
different functionality they'll try and

337
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">either block down the ability to take a</font>

338
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,899
picture or screenshot or they will

339
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:08,469
impair other functionality I think it

340
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,699
with citrix on their their demo website

341
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:12,649
there were certain things we try to do

342
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,819
it and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the hdmi video out it</font>

343
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,039
would just block the video signal

344
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:20,449
suddenly we just have a black box<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

345
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,669
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could affect as you say</font>

346
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,978
vignette I mean if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they chose for pre me</font>

347
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:29,449
just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what are you cool</font>

348
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:34,069
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Legos we'll just call it really</font>

349
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:37,968
exactly a leg a tower of doom<font color="#CCCCCC"> but anyway</font>

350
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:39,378
so I'm this kinda yeah yeah you know

351
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:41,089
somebody mentioned earlier I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

352
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:44,829
actually when you provided a tablet you

353
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:48,079
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's let's look at I books because</font>

354
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:49,699
you can't copy them out or whatever very

355
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,589
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there i'll give you that</font>

356
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:56,029
functionality some of the other things

357
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking at the external picture</font>

358
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,529
your video capture what we can do for

359
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:02,358
the pictures a a lot of you may have

360
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,579
seen this when the ipad first came out

361
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:08,659
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you print off an ipad use foot is</font>

362
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:11,508
out the copier this was actually out of

363
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:13,729
forensics conference and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

364
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much nicer camera tray and</font>

365
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:17,209
everything else but it didn't have the

366
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">robotic arm so that was an enhancement</font>

367
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,309
we made we also looked at what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

368
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,379
take a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera and put it there on a</font>

369
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,809
tripod i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting great pictures and</font>

370
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,459
everything the problem with that for

371
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,019
most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is their co-workers gonna</font>

372
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,439
notice that especially if it ain't the

373
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,239
office and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing in my</font>

374
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:38,419
case my co-workers saw it and they kind

375
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:44,119
of close my door and walk you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

376
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:46,249
to know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing alright sorry</font>

377
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:48,139
talked about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things I terms</font>

378
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,359
of being lazy the repeating key

379
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:51,619
sequences one things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

380
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:53,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tablet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or we're looking at the</font>

381
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,300
drinking bird since I can remember the

382
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,670
movie darkness

383
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,069
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the drinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bird in that</font>

384
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,920
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is somebody was tied to a chair</font>

385
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there was a bomb and they to build</font>

386
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspense they had a drinking bird and it</font>

387
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:08,859
kept getting closer and closer to

388
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,750
pressing the button and eventually it

389
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,469
press the button the problem with using

390
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,179
a drinking bird other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may not</font>

391
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,670
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to expense off the seven dollars</font>

392
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,890
depending on your employer is they were

393
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">lying on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a temperature difference so</font>

394
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,420
it's only evaporation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head of the</font>

395
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,099
material that's on the head it dips

396
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,929
itself with water and that's how it

397
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,490
keeps it going the other thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

398
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually apply heat to the other</font>

399
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,450
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bird and as we were doing the</font>

400
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,820
experimentation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we would set</font>

401
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,410
things up the exhaust fan on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

402
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,360
computer was blowing out enough of a

403
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,429
warm plume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we set the bird near</font>

404
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,490
it it would perpetually be powered by

405
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:48,420
the exhaust fan on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer so that</font>

406
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,230
long exhaustive<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is pretty much yes</font>

407
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:55,300
back to your foot back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we got</font>

408
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,470
t-shirt with a dicky-bird with a thug

409
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:05,559
pepper yes like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hood the thing else is</font>

410
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:11,110
make it's like a crest isn't it handy

411
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:13,000
that you are the host artist so so at

412
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,830
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point in our evening we've now got</font>

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,660
this SD card we've got the sequence of

414
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">images of all the different pages we had</font>

415
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,429
like how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to go combine us</font>

416
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,320
we tried several different ways looking

417
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,300
for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easiest or</font>

418
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,928
the laziest way to do it try doing a

419
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,690
powerpoint and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just creating a slide</font>

420
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:32,860
paste an image in there and it really

421
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,790
didn't work well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having problems</font>

422
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the margins and stuff like that we</font>

423
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,149
needed up using a Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word we had</font>

424
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,750
better luck doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in Windows than we</font>

425
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,940
did in Mac so what we do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start up</font>

426
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,520
explore<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight the first picture it</font>

427
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,520
would copy it tab over to word paste it

428
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,168
in hit enter and switch back over go to

429
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next image maybe just continue to</font>

430
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">repeat that later on on any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac or is</font>

431
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,160
that because of screen resolution /

432
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,659
fonts or was the challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ran into</font>

433
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,950
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac was when we go to tap back</font>

434
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,520
over to the window<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

435
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,410
images we were having some issues with

436
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,870
how it would like reach through

437
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,630
end of a row of images or a certain

438
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">place in the column of images and how</font>

439
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,790
the cursor would go ahead and advance

440
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,590
and so in some cases we're able to

441
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,020
overcome that by changing the view from

442
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,060
baby doing thumbnails to now I'm just

443
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a long list of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we</font>

444
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,950
try to sometimes we had to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

445
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,449
shape of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous winter so if my</font>

446
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,640
explore when it was like this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

447
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,410
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> columns I change it to I only had</font>

448
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,840
one column then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

449
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,060
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the right so that was a</font>

450
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,610
challenge we ran into able to get

451
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,110
through that but what was the easiest

452
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:49,260
and smooth this way of getting it done

453
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:52,000
was actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> word and in Windows</font>

454
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:56,170
say there's genuine use for the blind

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,850
isn't they are we I like believe we have

456
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,780
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the voyage of this sort of</font>

457
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,310
equation in terms of digital offensive

458
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,940
it'd be interesting to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

459
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for the visually impaired</font>

460
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,130
that's a there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any time</font>

461
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,540
and you consider that one person I

462
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,040
saying once you have the OC r you can

463
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,639
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya have it read to you</font>

464
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,159
essentially at that point well I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

465
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,080
at all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other restrictions on it you</font>

466
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,100
might still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we did</font>

467
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,260
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> out loud the bed you could say</font>

468
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,350
this is voiced emotion was we're dragon

469
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,750
naturallyspeaking in those where<font color="#CCCCCC"> my dad</font>

470
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,240
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a mechanical turk transcribe</font>

471
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,290
it for you right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought you</font>

472
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,310
could probably do it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telephone</font>

473
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:47,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really achieve a lot of bad ideas</font>

474
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:50,740
page<font color="#E5E5E5"> alisa need a really big bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas I</font>

475
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,150
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm okay except the next</font>

476
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,040
conference now I get dragon

477
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,380
naturallyspeaking but you do attract so

478
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,300
many in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India as a service to India and</font>

479
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,250
you actually get<font color="#CCCCCC"> provisioned alive and</font>

480
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,040
get it running during<font color="#CCCCCC"> your presentation</font>

481
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you email the results back to</font>

482
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,970
everyone excellent excellent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

483
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,380
probably the best way to do that is

484
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,820
talked to two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and</font>

485
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,970
say whichever one has the better

486
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,649
transcription results from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trial</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">term contract</font>

489
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:26,799
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get translated into</font>

490
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:31,960
Chinese and get it back to them yes so

491
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:34,120
fellow friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> won it there will be no</font>

492
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,799
copies of our doctrine and don't even

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what's going on at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

they call the concept of fun that's

495
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,590
really screwed the modification

496
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,820
modification of the Chinese one of the

497
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,168
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we ran into is we're</font>

498
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,480
starting to stitch things together<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

499
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well we have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the OCR and we</font>

500
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,470
had every searching what stuff people

501
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,909
commonly have around<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you know</font>

502
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,480
grab for free that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go</font>

503
00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:00,279
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend the money scan store is a</font>

504
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,480
one website they have a bunch of

505
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,559
comparisons of different OCR software

506
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,000
they have one of times they had free

507
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,100
trials but the free trials tend to have

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,779
limits it was either on page<font color="#E5E5E5"> counts or</font>

509
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,459
the number of images or some other

510
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,770
restriction there are some online

511
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,350
versions where you let you upload an

512
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:21,100
image and it would transcribe it and but

513
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you only do one image at a time fail</font>

514
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:28,149
because it's slow and I'm lazy I don't

515
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,250
want to I got Legos to do my work for me

516
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:34,449
I've got you know a gamepad somewhere

else or drinking bird yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> philippi the</font>

518
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,840

519
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need for my annual review with my</font>

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,710
couple other things but he was he'd go

bird how come you're so very efficient

545
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:47,799
well century and ultimately what we

546
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:51,428
ended up doing for most of the OCR is

547
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,408
actually Acrobat Pro it does OCR you can

548
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,529
get the trial version is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 30 days I'm</font>

549
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:58,389
sure many people have extended trial

550
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,370
versions they say it's still flex Yuma

system so later on as people get play

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,289
with that I can show both the gamepad

557
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,669
how it goes through and it pieces the

558
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,158
documents together from the different

using the copy protected on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hdmi</font>

566
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:44,500
occasionally you're able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use</font>

567
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,049
the converter that converts<font color="#E5E5E5"> hdmi into</font>

00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:53,769
it's going to work there's a software

571
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,840
application called traps it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> $37</font>

572
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:58,179
that will let you record whatever is

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,149
happening on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen the downside to</font>

574
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,039
that is it makes huge file so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,570
it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're recording like a</font>

minute or two of whatever game you're

577
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,059
playing but if you're going to record

578
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:12,158
three hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scrolling through</font>

579
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:14,889
document your massive massive files and

580
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,149
that's a real problem and we're also

581
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,758
we're concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening</font>

have their<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to figure correctly</font>

608
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,660
that people go through most documents

sometimes they spend a little more time

610
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,950
reading a graphic or less time because

the whole page was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture but it</font>

easy thing to flag the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> then pretty good in a pretty</font>

going on with that on the device side

and this is what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> drove us to do</font>

634
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,800
the camera at first instead of actually

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,890
having a device even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they weren't</font>

application had the ability to notice

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,240
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture was taken so it couldn't</font>

stop the user from taking a picture on

641

yeah what's taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out nicely probably</font>

backwards to look at the same picture I

769
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,910
yeah and as we're looking at stuff that

770
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,040
was completely commonly available<font color="#CCCCCC"> furs</font>

771
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,660
so what we did was he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> one stuff</font>

772
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,340

778
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,160
something so if you tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise</font>

785
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,939
comparable to the lego mindstorms that

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,129
you've seen yet on gratis one unfriended

787

793
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,620

794
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,889
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your cost difference will</font>

795
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,690
probably just for the lego stuff be

796
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,860
somewhere twenty twenty dollars dirty

797
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,020
dollars difference to piece it together

798
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,339
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know we could look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is it</font>

799
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,109
isn't probably been a

803
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:45,468
exactly as is that would be a more

804
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,019
kissable thing for the next conference

805
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:51,379
so you havin having the vendor area have

806
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:54,678
your own catch ya some ID other demos

807

811
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,729
in a tree so at least and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpaa said</font>

812
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:10,339
there's question about how can school

813
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:12,739
teachers provide video clips or sections

814
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:13,910
and do gay said well it's fair use if

815
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:17,299
you take a camera and point at

816
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,299
whatever's on the screen is anxiously do
