around education and one of the things I

I've used them for a while but I'm we

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,810
often surprises me is how often people

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,320
have never seen them before which is

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,250
national security strategy in what I

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,890
always tell my students is the most

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,990
important word I use with them

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,159
interconnected because I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

interconnectedness of the world and and

what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing right now is a</font>

48
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,288
wonderful example that of the

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,620
interconnectivity uh that's changing the

00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:15,958
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next slide yeah miss my one</font>

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,260
attempted humor I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attempt to</font>

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,150
to move you from the left-hand column

53
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,220
meaning winds house over on the

54

he laid on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all this but you should</font>

57
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,290
start right now and let's go the

58
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,940
slightest says target list because

59
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,379
there's there's three things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about information</font>

61
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:46,170
briefly and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain the</font>

62
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,329
concepts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for information as</font>

63
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,458
an element national power I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

64
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:53,099
about cyber space in the severed domain

65
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,230
as different from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

66
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,390
environment and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all plays in</font>

67
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,819
the national<font color="#CCCCCC"> security strategy and then</font>

68
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,599
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

69
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and especially the</font>

70
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,828
educational piece that I promised when I

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,290
would touch on because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

72
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,930
there are some things that we do very

73
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,828
very well and there are some things that

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,940
we are doing abysmally poorly at and

75
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:17,340
unfortunately the parts were doing the

76
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,380
worst on are the most important parts in

77
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,319
my opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's go to the next</font>

78
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,299
slide it says paradigm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kate if we go</font>

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,119
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those mid 90s as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wind was</font>

80
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,010
talking about back at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school of</font>

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,620
information warfare and strategy it into

82
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,929
use I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were making</font>

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,079
this stuff up but we were still

84
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,669
intellectually grappling we still are

85
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,290
with what this all meant and how we

86
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:44,430
could capture it and how it could

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,980
portray it in a in a format that would

88
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,489
be useful to students in a bug and i

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">created this this building block you see</font>

90
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,799
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this Venn diagram which</font>

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,560
really builds in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom up at the at</font>

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,090
the bottom was a term that some of you

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,959
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably still recognized command</font>

94
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,769
and control warfare c2w yeah and always

95
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,900
argue that c2w was the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

96
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,030
block for everything came afterwards

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,900
because it's the stuff that the

98
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">militaries of the world not just ours</font>

102
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,230
very clearly of things that we need to

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font>

105
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,680
operations are what we're now calling me

106
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,410
so things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things that that</font>

107
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,810
service good old-fashioned blasky

108
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,290
fragmentation in warfare so I've always

109
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted an argument that c2w was a</font>

Dueling blow off to something larger and

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,670
I use the term that has gone out of

112
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">favor in the DoD since then information</font>

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,180
use of this stuff military operations

115
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:01,930
offensively and defensively and that in

116
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,080
turn is a part as a subset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've</font>

117
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,080
come to term information operations

118
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,820
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually has started out ten years</font>

119
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,099
to go information operations was a

120
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,040
broader concept I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has</font>

121
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,650
narrowed down to now but what I really

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on is the big box that's</font>

184
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:11,289
that if the information power is the use

of information content in the technology

they

200
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,740
to a fairly simple approach towards it

201
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,840
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their argument was if I can</font>

use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment for my benefit and</font>

to prevent an adversary from using it

that sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds like power</font>

205
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,320
and so another way of looking at

206
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,450
information power is the ability to use

207
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,520
the information environment now this may

208
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,520
sound fairly nebulous but it's not there

209
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,420
are ways of counting in and tabulating

210
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,130
I'm quantifying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> power now and I'll</font>

218
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,120
this is what impact does it have how

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:56,360
effective is it let's go to the next

220

223
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,270
towards it is of my students<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font>

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,360
by heart dance 3 c's ste one is

connectivity and that is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

226
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,270

together human beings people

228

organizations military countries so that

229
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,090
that connectivity enables them to use

the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content</font>

and that is what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got what we go to</font>

232
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,990
what we what we create it can be words

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:39,170
can be images can be databases string of

234
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,020
ones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros it certainly can be</font>

then affects how we think and behave and

that's the hardest one because how do

you measure this how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure</font>

two very important pieces to the way

those definitions start out one a domain

use my my famous elephant some of you

maybe have heard either me or someone

else tell the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the five blind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">describe the elephant well they can each</font>

like a small small whip one grabs you

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,110
here and often it's like a huge leap

grabs a leg and often it's like a tree

377
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,679
well every single one of them was

378
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,700
exactly right in describing their

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole elephant and this is</font>

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,440
and I would wager that some of yours do

385
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:25,740
as well is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tended to try to</font>

386
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:28,140

particular piece that we have a hold of

389
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:37,289
and that that we deal with and so what

390
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,120
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened over the years is that the</font>

degrees and different amounts depending

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:31,110
upon different circumstances of what's

408
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:35,340
going on we have electromagnetic pulse

409
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,899
and directed energy which if you use the

410
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,549
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to try to make</font>

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,429
things are clearly cyber because cyber

414
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,830
is is defined by the electromagnetic

415

together varies depending upon the

422
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:12,840
context of what is happening and so it's

of other forms of armed conflict other

440
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:12,029
forms of warfare and I fundamentally

441
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with this approach cyber war is</font>

442
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,320
not sticks kids in a garage doing

443

something they may do something harmful

444
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,509
they may do something very negative but

445
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,090
that's not cyber war not unless you're

446
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:26,370
doing it under the direction of military

447
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,949
authorities for the furtherance of

448
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,908
military objectives and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

449
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,269
there's some continuity between

450
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:35,450
ourselves and and and the Russians in

451
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:42,139
and others is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can discuss this</font>

452
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:45,539
amongst yourself I hope we do about the

453
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:47,189
how he defines cyber war and how it

454

of the more profound thinkers on this

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the fundamental reasons why we</font>

470
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,389
created the United States Strategic up

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:30,780
Cyber Command was to put offense and

i think is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right way to do things um</font>

475
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,870
I realize not everyone thinks that and

476
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,130
there's an ongoing debate within the

484
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,560
can't settle myself but I hope you'll

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,610
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here at the conference</font>

486
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,639
it's go to the next slide briefly

487
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:14,370
because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tie this to national</font>

488
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,380
security strategy when the Obama

489
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:23,689
administration four years ago issued in

490
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:26,340
2010 it's a national<font color="#CCCCCC"> security strategy</font>

491
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,170
there was a fair amount of emphasis not

492
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,750
surprisingly in that strategy on

493
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,480
economics what was striking was that

494
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,990
there was no apparent linkage in the

495
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,690
strategy between cyber and economics

496
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a fair amount in the security</font>

497
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,780
strategy there is on cybersecurity one

or two pages in the in the strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

499
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,899
several paragraphs devoted to it and

500
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security of course is a very</font>

501
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:56,790
important thing but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no attempt</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> link together cyber in economics I</font>

503
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,480
was struck when later on in 2010 the

504
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,030
heretics government in very pretty

505
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,510
issued a snatcher security strategy and

506
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:15,530
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> made the same mistake it is</font>

507
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,720
quite a bit in there about cybersecurity

508
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:21,330
potential threat to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Olympics etc but</font>

509
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,970
there was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort made to link cyber</font>

510
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,320
to other parts of the society

511
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,010
I was struck with us because a couple

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chairing a</font>

after two years of that we did away with

732
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,880
sparked some discussion that will go on

<font color="#E5E5E5">for the rest of the rest of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today and</font>

00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:54,279
miracle that puts me in a very small

743
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,500
slice and so I'm fighting with every

744

ounce I have I appreciate you letting me

behind you support you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

750
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,869
it's here upon occasion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

751
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,790
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a long way but</font>

752
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,410
barring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question I'm gonna</font>

753
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,109
kick it off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I know Lars has</font>

754
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,240
probably got a couple to UM the

755
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:30,369
distinction between<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy and tactics</font>

756
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,919
is something that the private sector we

757
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:34,869
deal with very heavily<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

758
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,930
information security realm tactics you

759
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:40,630
can teach I maintain the strategy and

760
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">big thinking is inherent can you really</font>

761
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,990
teach strategy at the way that you're

762
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:46,150
alluding or you have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

763
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:49,149
people with the right mindset first in

764
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:53,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of form it I think I think</font>

765
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,660
both of those are true strategy is not

766
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy as tactics tactics are the</font>

767
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,960
things that that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> military forces are</font>

768
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,460
the most comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with strategy is</font>

769
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,329
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need but that I always found</font>

770
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:15,339
this uplifting and energizing at ndu was

771
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:18,280
every year I had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five ten or fifteen</font>

772
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:20,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty students who really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

773
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,650
dig into this and dive into it deeply

774
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:27,400
and it took these the strategic part of

775
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:32,470
this really to heart what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really</font>

776
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:36,549
takes there is a faculty that supports

777
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:40,540
them in this in an institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

778
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:42,880
supports the faculty in in trying to

779
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">teach this in trying to enable students</font>

780
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,060
to look at this

781
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,560
uh so it cuts across the board it would

782
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:55,100
eat the institutions that can can

783
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,779
support the Faculty's efforts to enable

784
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,589
and enhance the students<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take this</font>

785
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:03,700
off because because if if you give them

786
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the chance they they works for this Oh</font>

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,710
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance oh that's already been written</font>

798
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:42,920
in Chinese why I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what the</font>

written very seriously me too<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously</font>

801
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,190
but I think over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past 15 years we've</font>

802
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,960
we've seen a steady stream of things

803
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,180
that get written in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

804
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,260
and two or three is later two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

805
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">years later it gets turned back into in</font>

806
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,240
the Chinese for their purposes they're

807
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:08,529
doing a very good job thinking about

808
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it strategically</font>

809
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:15,650
yes if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from a diplomatic</font>

810
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,920
background you're aware that the Chinese

811
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,080
have been on a charm offensive in

812
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,510
several areas of the world are trying to

813
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">establish strong relations and good</font>

814
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:30,880
relations with those countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

815
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:33,890
see as sources of critical national

816
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,840
resources that they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tap into so</font>

817
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,620
they they understand the rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

818
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,590
information can play in this and they

819
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,109
take very seriously we fight the Chinese

820
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,840
already said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lander to Scotland it</font>

821
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,090
involves another separation I thank you

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your various</font>

824
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,720
question I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always say inserting to you</font>

825
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,880
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years about the relations</font>

826
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,390
between intimate relations and cyber

827
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,450
operations apparently did dat<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 13</font>

828
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">verses 3 12 what's your take today it</font>

829
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:16,250
has 3 13 and they're from Lotus<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

830
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:19,910
lost their<font color="#E5E5E5"> puzzle I feel strongly both</font>

831
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:24,800
ways uh I think I think putting Cyber

832
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:26,480
Command at at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA was probably the</font>

833
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,970
right and logical thing to do because

834
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,230
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're such obvious synergies</font>

835
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:36,200
between with capabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Nationals</font>

836
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Korean she has and what Cyber Command is</font>

837
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,850
being tasked to so there's there's

838
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:44,890
obvious reasons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it there on</font>

839
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:48,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same other hand on the other hand I</font>

840
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">think by putting it there it has</font>

841
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,630
exacerbated and worsened the splitting

842
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:56,870
apart of cyber from<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

843
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,730
operations and I and the train that I

844
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:02,600
see rolling down the track here in the

845
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:06,770
United States military is not towards

846
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,960
bringing cyber and info ops together the

847
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,070
train is the one that's pulling them

848
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,750
farther apart and and that troubles me

849
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:19,070
that was the effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I tried to make</font>

850
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">it at ndu what I tried to try to drive</font>

851
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:25,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">students to think about the combining of</font>

852
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:28,430
those those activities I'm not sure

853
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:33,290
anyone is doing that now that I think is

854
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:35,690
a problem then<font color="#E5E5E5"> well a dance you are</font>

855
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hardy uh I retire US Navy cap and I kind</font>

856
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,400
of got around over by that train I don't

857
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,830
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> toward the end of my career was</font>

858
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,960
that info war and cyber war should not

859
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,360
be a j2 function should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a j-3</font>

860
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,940
function for those not Greek free me and

861
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">off Stubing Intel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what's</font>

862
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,800
happened is the ignorance and the

863
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,090
arrogance of our senior officer is such

864
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,130
that they don't understand it they

865
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,190
flicked it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the j2 saying can you</font>

866
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:03,380
solve this puzzle and j2 said well we

867
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,299
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how much manpower any</font>

868
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,700
I don't 300 millets you got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like damn</font>

869
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:08,990
we should ask for 500 the problem is

870
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,788
we're not training your future

871
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,799
generation of combatant commanders to

872
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:14,329
think inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire and we're going to</font>

873
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,859

00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:19,640
to delegate it to the analysts who are

we're setting herself up for massive

that's the train we're going I think

00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:43,880
putting again<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the placement</font>

running this it should not be the Intel

895
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:17,150
community and I don't say that to

896
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:20,809
denigrate the intelligence community we

897
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:23,750
can't fight and win without them you can

need anybody else in intelligence is an

absolutely vital aspect of every form of

906
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:48,289
that and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there from here</font>

907
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:50,240
without a catastrophe I don't know I've

908
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:53,960
heard too many people I've heard too

909
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,519
many people offer the the advisory that

910
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,910
it won't get better until we see a

911
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:02,029
catastrophe and and by then of course

912
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,980
it's a tad too<font color="#E5E5E5"> late unless we somehow</font>

913
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:05,960
need to inoculate our system much like

they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it we can vaccine to help</font>

00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,779
the human system do well is it seditious

916
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:15,649
to try to create some sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario</font>

917
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:16,790
that propels national decision makers to

national security sort of a really

00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,170
really thin line there no we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could want</font>

959
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:14,120
when you wrote Jenna 313 my day I didna

960
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:16,879
quote there the ultimate goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:20,509
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there any part</font>

962
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,100
in the system result well have who has

963
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,100
the scent of gravity for thinking on the

964
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:29,110
cognitive side and not just on one since

965

<font color="#CCCCCC">heroes is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps here to sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coma</font>

967
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:40,870
existing I don't know how to answer that

968
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ours human behaviors is the ultimate</font>

969
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:46,180
goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want to affect how how</font>

it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a billion of them or some</font>

972
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,540
range in between there you want to

973
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,290
affect how they do things how they think

974
00:46:52,540 --> 00:47:01,480
and it make decisions and act and so

975
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:07,420
it's the human cognitive response result

976
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:12,670
is the is the ultimate goal now I'm just
