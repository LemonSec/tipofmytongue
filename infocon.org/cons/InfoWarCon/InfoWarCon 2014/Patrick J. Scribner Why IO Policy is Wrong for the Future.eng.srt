of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ronnie and scientists who plugged it</font>

153
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,080
in and we had stocks that that is a raid

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,030
enter and leave but the virus stayed

155
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,419
behind became public knowledge and stuff

156
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,099

the Silk Road and so on and countering

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,159
cyber warfare contains elements that

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,850
by the Iranians it's fairly

it happened quickly it's it's all cyber

fact a regular warfare this is a

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,240
definition on the left for those who do

204
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">not follow military fares as closely</font>

205

206
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">like they look like acai berry' things</font>

207
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,700
you can have cyber irregular warfare as

208
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,470
a way to strip legitimacy from a

209
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,440
government instead of different banking

210
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,910
systems there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to degrade</font>

211
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,500
because governments operate online they

212
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,540
there they email addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of cyber-espionage things</font>

214
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,650
you can counter that as an insurgent and

215
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,479
keep your own networks alive<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

221
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,530
says power to soak things up so did

222
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:26,880
Petraeus but the terrorists can do it

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you can possibly do it and</font>

of this they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently not terrorist</font>

groups but<font color="#E5E5E5"> their precursors of things to</font>

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,260
come you have groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of mobile</font>

234
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,020
eyes on the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they can do their</font>

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,939
own exciting things

236
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:01,100
and from there they are the precursors

237
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,500
of things to come they're currently not

238
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,390
really being malignant and really

239
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,710
aggressive in destroying things but if

240
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,170
you had a well-funded group in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,030
future as as we have network of the

event of all things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole internet</font>

243
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,510
and I believe today's is buzz right as

244
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,000
that sort of increases becomes more

245
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,069
possible and usable that is a problem

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,480
unto itself you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have cyber</font>

247
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,730
terrorism people run around on the

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:00,380
of active defense and just got

261
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">capabilities to maybe push back or take</font>

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,080
of that nature yes um cyber cyber is not

264
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,880
just warfare with cyber's dollars the

265

mostly private things in cyber warfare<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

approaches sort of dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this and</font>

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,300
warfare has now become a problem of the

people i mean who is hacked by china

273

contractor they're all private companies

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,280
but they have ties to the government

278
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,730
because they are tied they're there for

279
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,569
target targeted by a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nations</font>

280
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are so because it is</font>

281
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,600
more time together public and private

282
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,980
sector now they must come together and

283
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,380
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> proper the way to do all of this</font>

284
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,880
at least you end up with private sector

285
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,870
saying man or the government

286
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care until you have sort of sort</font>

288
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,329
of cataclysmic event which is suddenly

289
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,920
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should care tell you today</font>

290
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,960
Darren on the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> John's point</font>

291
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,030
here because soon you bring in private

the traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> special forces</font>

they're operating outside the rules of

conventional war outside the legal

sick saying as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Special Forces Group</font>

301
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,459
to operate it is that how do you manage

302
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,900
this especially under the FISA and I say

303
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,490
microscope that were under these days I

304
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,170
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> business well how do you make this</font>

305
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen hug you you it's very difficult</font>

306
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,709
to do but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more of a</font>

307
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,810
conceptual framework by which you can

308
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,100
examine cyber warfare I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

309
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,290
you examine side work from a class of

its<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ian point of view you've lost it</font>

311
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,270
yeah you do the Blackwater thing I are

312
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,939
solely<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government and any</font>

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,910
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted someone listen to you get the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rich today and then we wanted someone</font>

318
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,730
listen to you get the Americans to it so

319
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,800
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys want something you ask a</font>

don't call the SAS because the seals

326
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,260
pronto maybe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never watched try</font>

327
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,000
but if you consider if I think at least

328
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,280
they can consider I continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to examine</font>

329
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,380
cyber warfare through the realm of a

the line is definitely blurred in

338
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,680
we use the seals will use special forces

339
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,900
to do so and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you adapt that</font>

340
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,640
framework for examining cyber warfare

341
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,800
it's much more effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to look</font>

at

in this example of simply cyber defense

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what can we short questions look we</font>

this is fishing director in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa in</font>

351
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,640
learn a lot on our our<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of even</font>

352
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,860
even our concept of information in iron

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the lexicon to discuss it</font>

354
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,630
fully which is why after 25 years you

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,630
can't agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I owe is or is that the</font>

Russians had addiction in 1985 it's

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,589
gotta be this stick if not more to put

358

out by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KGB and it clears out very</font>

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,820
clearly I of definitions and there are

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty terms to discuss I oh and</font>

361
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,510
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a type of lexicon and that's</font>

362
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,220
the kind of state<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though the KGB's</font>

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:32,050
it so that's example of this with your

cyber counterterrorism<font color="#E5E5E5"> um how you how to</font>

use cyber things to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down terrorists</font>

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,480
groups they're sort of more spread out

377
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,579
like Al Qaeda's bests or an example of

381
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,899
through the internet email addresses and

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on sort of how do you use cyber tools</font>

383
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,910
to disrupt not only their communications

384

435
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,339
they're suddenly building better

cracking at muffin in their class that

437

keel and certain meeting these guys I

was on a training circuit with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

this was like 94 we started doing it and

556
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,399
I was asked to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of exercises</font>

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were not sophisticated like we do</font>

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,750
today but fairly simple conceptual

559
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,580
exercises with some role-playing to put

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">people through some of the thought</font>

processes the games were effectively

star trek to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kobayashi Maru they were</font>

563
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:50,200
unwinnable games I put on about 300 of

564
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:55,930
them one group in one who won the Navy

565
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:59,140
SEALs and they cheated if absolutely

566
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:02,110
cheated but it's panic that was like 95

567
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:06,310
96 it taught me so much conceptually

568
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:09,399
about our spec ops and that's why I was

569

appreciating your paper and the concept

570
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,360
because I'm not sure we've really been

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about spec ops a whole lot with</font>
