1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,679
internet of things the big problem that

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,269
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk in these days is mobile in the</font>

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,519
devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were all screwing around</font>

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,250
with here all day long and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand it over to Georgia you've got the</font>

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,420
room it's all yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi everybody I</font>

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,369
can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've ever given a</font>

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,189
presentation into somebody's living room

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,009
before but first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everything</font>

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,750
this is actually the second time I've

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,329
given a presentation where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,329
wearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants so take that how you will</font>

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's obviously a delay on my</font>

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,730
audios you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> laugh like five seconds</font>

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,940
after I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so i'll try and</font>

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,640
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into account yes the devices</font>

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,260
um this is google glass obviously I

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,440
haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the Google</font>

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,899
glass yet but it's just android so it's

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,910
on my very long list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do</font>

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,400
somewhere near the tops to write

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,679
payloads for this you know just to show

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">off how cool I am I hope nobody's</font>

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,400
attaching their Google glass to their

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,770
corporate wife I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet but probably</font>

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,390
they are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what we're</font>

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,570
going to talk about today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made some</font>

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,710
slides just for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where'd it</font>

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,839
go it just broke can you guys still hear

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,929
me because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't see you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore there</font>

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
we go okay all right slides so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font>

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">share my screen we learned how to do</font>

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,430
this like two days ago here we get a

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,809
screen share and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just show the</font>

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,670
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll make a scary loop</font>

36
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:47,009
so now you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see yourselves right yes</font>

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now i want slides</font>

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,189
and so I made these slides and they

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,079
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a background if you've</font>

40
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,020
ever seen one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my presentations before</font>

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,990
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been black and white</font>

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,500
for white<font color="#CCCCCC"> and black but I actually made</font>

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,689
real slides just for you guys ok so when

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,649
came up with the name they're not whim

45
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,560
when women's another person all together

46
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,870
alright so the bring-your-own-device

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,640
issue

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that this doesn't get enough</font>

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,629
attention from the attackers perhaps so

50
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,109
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people love to use like bring</font>

51
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:27,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own device is a buzzword but then</font>

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,049
when people call it out on Twitter and

53
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,530
say when was the last time a company

54
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,659
actually was breached and somebody found

55
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,970
out that the reason why was because

56
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,179
somebody had a mobile device on the

57
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,730
network and nobody can think of any

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,280
issue that that's ever happened ever not

59
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,530
even me so the attack is really need to

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and start proving me right or</font>

61
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,769
maybe they can wait a little while

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,048
because I need time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build my</font>

63
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,420
professional product so then I can make

64
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,790
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money it's fun it's it they can</font>

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait but eventually they've got to do</font>

66
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,010
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this because it's really</font>

67
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of easy and I guess the real reason</font>

68
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,548
that nobody's attacking bring your own

69
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,190
device is because it's still so easy to

70
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:13,299
just attack Java or get somebody to open

71
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,430
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email attachment so maybe if people</font>

72
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,130
start actually being secure people will

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,160
attack mobile but whatever anyway so

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,829
mobile devices theoretically it should

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,639
be really hard to jump from a mobile

76
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:31,419
device on to the actual machines in the

77
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,540
enterprise but in most cases that I've

78
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,590
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen been like dude can I get on</font>

79
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">your wireless and even in corporations</font>

80
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,280
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been they just dumped me in</font>

81
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,690
with everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that's not always</font>

82
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,970
true like I saw Paul in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience</font>

83
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,430
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dianetics i think and they have a</font>

84
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,650
guest network and that was good but most

85
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,569
places it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just kind of take</font>

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,340
a look around at what network I monocyte

87
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,500
wow you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see everything I</font>

88
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,120
used to work for a government agency we

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,389
actually had the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,940
everything was all on one same network

91
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,500
all the printers all the mobile devices

92
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,750
all everything there weren't that many

93
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,609
mobile devices back then but if you knew

94
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,849
the wireless password you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

95
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:19,060
yourself on there and you know that

96
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:21,339
happens but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if let's say corporate</font>

97
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,740
networks good we actually secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

98
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,929
but the laptop from work goes home and

99
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,210
it has a VPN back to work now we all

100
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,949
like to work from<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

101
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,638
our companies want us to work on the

102
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:35,130
weekends so we VPN back to work probably

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,500
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> home network not going to be a</font>

104
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,380
secure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally have real problems</font>

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,900
typing in passwords into the printer so

106
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,699
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave my wireless open I live</font>

107
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the country I can get away with that</font>

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,199
my neighbors can't see it you can't even

109
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:52,680
see it from the road but it's still not

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,840
a very secure thing to do but this home

111
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,639
networks probably pretty simple I don't

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,250
know very many people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like</font>

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,199
partitioned guests networks if they do

114
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,870
they're probably very geeky your normal

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,910
average individual probably not so their

116
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,759
mobile devices are going to definitely

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,490
get on the same network as their work

118
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,500
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if their work laptop happens</font>

119
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,720
to have any vulnerabilities you will

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,910
have a direct access to it same

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,280
situation you kind of breach the

122
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,380
perimeter you're in the local<font color="#CCCCCC"> network we</font>

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,138
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the trouble of</font>

124
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,840
getting through like hopping on the

125
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,460
wireless or getting through perimeter

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,650
through like social engineering or

127
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,919
anything we just popped into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile</font>

128
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">device and we have direct access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to any</font>

129
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,729
of the other devices in the network I

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,159
don't know about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you</font>

131
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,190
didn't audit on my home network it would

132
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,430
probably come up to be pretty pathetic

133
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,080
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I actually teach</font>

134
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security right so I have all</font>

135
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,830
these vulnerable virtual machines lying

136
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,110
around i forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn them off and i</font>

137
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,210
install software because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,740
write exercises for my exploit dev class

139
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,258
and again i forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it all off</font>

140
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used to do this when i worked at</font>

141
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,759
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and no one ever said</font>

142
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the leg vulnerability</font>

143
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,039
from 1998 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just left on a web</font>

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,780
server on my workstation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had all my</font>

client reports on it too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

146
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with these things no one</font>

147
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,650
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention so I have mobile device and</font>

148
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,330
we're really making that big of a

149
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference probably not but it's another</font>

150
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,979
way we could infiltrate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a</font>

151
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,020
little nice picture here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she had my</font>

152
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,240
little company logo in the corner 2 i'm

153
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,099
rather proud of that may be a real

154
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,240
businesswoman now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird</font>

155
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,009
hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess the big</font>

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,080
question that people have is can you add

157
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">chili attack mobile device can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font>

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,058
well obviously you could attack it but

159
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:51,330
can you successfully attack it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

160
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:54,330
kind of have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of mobile</font>

161
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,789
attacks here so like remote mobile

162
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,899
attacks I say they're rare and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

163
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:04,050
say they're on par with remote attacks

164
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:06,059
of other devices like you know ms<font color="#E5E5E5"> 08 06</font>

165
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,819
seven was big deal but that was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

166
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,710
XP people<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately still fall</font>

167
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,649
victim to it but hopefully they've

168
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,568
patched it the vulnerabilities that are

169
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,430
coming out now we see a lot more client

170
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,460
side and the browser stuff use after

171
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,819
freeze java<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe Reader things like</font>

172
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,128
that we don't see if many remote by any

173
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,099
means as we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> though they do on</font>

174
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,270
occasion happen but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remotes</font>

175
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,498
you're going to see you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bad at</font>

176
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,508
on software like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7's</font>

177
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:39,839
and whatnot where execution prevention

178
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:42,330
is off by default on anything that's not

179
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,309
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows dll then you know somebody</font>

180
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,219
installs something and it's got a Oh

181
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:49,259
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> boner ability on it and that's</font>

182
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,819
how you get popped it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

183
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,680
thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile devices there's</font>

184
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,779
nothing to say I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an app</font>

185
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,539
that listens on a port or something then

186
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,099
we'd have a remote attack but there you

187
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,580
know there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some like just this</font>

188
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,860
past black hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> carsten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know talked about</font>

189
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,899
his sim card attacks where he basically

190
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,050
attacks the cryptography of the sim card

191
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,729
and then gets them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run payload to</font>

192
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,249
convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> ism</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's legitimate from the</font>

193
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,959
carrier they use bad crypto who knew

194
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:19,669
people use bad crypto and even if you

195
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:22,289
use good crypto NSA is watching anyways

196
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,180
seriously I was not surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this</font>

197
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,639
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if i can make your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

198
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,169
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the government can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

199
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,279
was the movie me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom we're watching</font>

200
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,808
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> day we were watching this</font>

201
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,240
movie we were watching an enigma about

202
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Bletchley Park I'm almost just like</font>

203
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,589
why did we not assume people were

204
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,529
watching us if like in the 40s they were

205
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,750
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so that's just my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set in it</font>

206
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,389
did anyway remote attacks occasionally

207
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you don't</font>

208
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">even have to do anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

209
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">really blame the loot the loser having</font>

210
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,279
the user but I mean the loser<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

211
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,840
who's using the phone because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

212
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,750
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

213
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,190
anything their phone was just vulnerable

214
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,870
naturally so things like cell tower

215
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,760
attacks where you put up a malicious

216
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,890
cell tower like if you've ever gone to

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,200
China and every app on your phone

218
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,330
suddenly wants to update the minute you

219
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,060
hit the Chinese cell towers that's an

220
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,220
example of malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> tower it just you</font>

221
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the Chinese government improve of</font>

222
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,120
this they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us find everybody</font>

223
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably our towers are doing it too and</font>

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,220
we just don't talk about it so remote

225
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,190
attacks happen and that we can't really

226
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix if we don't know about it is we</font>

227
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,790
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really tell users don't click on</font>

228
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and we can't you really use mobile</font>

229
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,630
device management to segregate something

230
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,310
that's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sim card vulnerability</font>

231
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,140
they just don't work that way at this

232
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,959
point at least none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones I've</font>

233
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,270
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at but then you know are</font>

234
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,250
more prevalent client-side attacks our

235
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,740
entire world<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taken up with them you'd</font>

236
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,940
think if we got rid of other

237
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,980
vulnerabilities we wouldn't have any

238
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,670
more vulnerabilities anymore because no

239
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,730
one would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever open nasty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in their</font>

240
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,400
applications unfortunately I open nasty

241
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,680
stuff all the time i use a mac we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

242
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,410
get viruses right so i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

243
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,810
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff but people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

244
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,209
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just the</font>

245
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,489
other day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like well how many</font>

246
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">times a week do i do something like</font>

247
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,410
click through a certificate or install

248
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,820
something on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac that says this</font>

249
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,219
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been signed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was</font>

250
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,750
downloading new stuff for Android SDKs

251
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,310
and one of the package<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wasn't</font>

252
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,780
signed and it gave me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a warning but I</font>

253
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,540
wanted it because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

254
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for glass right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I installed</font>

255
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,680
it but I thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even me as a</font>

256
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,990
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> person how many times per week</font>

257
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,829
do i do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not that I</font>

258
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,690
would tell my users not to do and it's

259
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a pretty high number and if we</font>

260
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,320
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is probably a pretty high</font>

261
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,140
number for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of us and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our phones are</font>

262
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,300
just the same way every thing that's on

263
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,870
the phones that open some sort of

264
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:54,170
document or file could potentially be

265
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,300
exploited and vulnerability cannot like

266
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Firefox earlier this year where the</font>

267
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,699
official Firefox app would basically

268
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,380
read anything from its private directory

269
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,120
including your stored usernames and

270
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,279
passwords and it would send them off

271
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,800
those nobody put that in there

272
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,839
purpose it just happens secure coding is

273
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,089
hard I should know I've never been able

vulnerability database you will see i

277
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:24,709
have a few entries there myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cure</font>

device could potentially hurt us but you

280
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,670
know I when somebody sends me a link and

social engineering so I used to believe

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,100
that social engineering was made up and

285
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:45,019
it didn't really work<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like who</font>

286
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,879
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually open this like my mom</font>

287
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,129
keeps sending me these ones because I'm

288
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,199
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study malware analysis right</font>

289
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:53,749
now so she<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keeps sending me stuff</font>

290
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she gets in her spam there's like</font>

291
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:57,949
stuff they want you to open delicious

292
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,559
PDFs and it's like the grammar on them

293
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,779
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so terrible and who would ever</font>

294
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,399
open this I know there's better ones

295
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,259
I've seen some pretty good ones where it

296
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,110
looks like well you just bought a TV off

297
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,750
best buy and there's a problem with your

298
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,819
order and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like wait I didn't buy it</font>

299
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,279
to you naturally I want to see what's up

300
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,459
cuz i think i've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked right so</font>

301
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,110
there we are but you know and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my case</font>

302
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,609
if it's particularly early in the

303
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,680
morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i drank too much the night</font>

304
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,660
before i will be more likely to click on

305
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,809
stuff just in case you want to steal my

306
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff they sure tidbit you guys aren't</font>

307
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:35,000
laughing I'm obviously skin off after

308
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,219
all these years you know I have tried

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,639
really hard to be funny I'm just not I

310
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,809
give up I'll be serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so you</font>

311
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:48,889
know last night what we did we drink a

312
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:50,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">single drink last night okay well I</font>

313
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,709
fired now this was going to be in

314
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,209
somebody's house<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally would have</font>

315
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,750
driven up there you guys are only like

316
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,000
eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away I could have driven I</font>

317
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,920
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I spend a lot of time at</font>

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,110
conferences and staying<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hotels and</font>

319
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,939
whatnot so this opportunity is there we

320
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,939
get work done it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe I'll take</font>

321
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:10,219
it but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know nobody</font>

322
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:13,929
clicks on malicious links in emails

323
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,519
nobody answers the phone and gives the

324
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:19,240
insurance agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> their social security</font>

325
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">number over the phone that never happens</font>

326
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,770
so we know it does

327
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,930
but we've taught everyone in our

328
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,520
organization that they're absolutely not

329
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,050
going to fall for this that means

330
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,390
business probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> never gets done</font>

331
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,219
because everybody suspects everybody and

332
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,560
you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually walk up to</font>

333
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,850
somebody's cubicle every time somebody

334
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,829
sends you an email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure they</font>

335
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,170
sent it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

336
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,210
at home so business basically ceases

337
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,699
because social engineering doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

338
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,150
anymore let's pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's really</font>

339
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,140
happening then you've got all these new

340
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,380
communication methods with the phones

341
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,199
like SMS that's text message right how

342
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,610
can text hurt you I don't understand

343
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,590
that one myself you know when somebody

344
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,440
asked me how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> a text message hurt you</font>

345
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:04,320
it's made out of text well that one's

346
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,330
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain but then you've got like</font>

347
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,310
near field communication like if I leave

348
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,900
on the near field communication on my

349
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,420
phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like walk into an</font>

350
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,110
elevator at a hotel it pops up with tags

351
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's automatically scanned Charlie</font>

352
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,480
Miller did some research on LCD and I

353
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,119
was kind of disappointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I didn't</font>

354
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,920
make the whole world fall down it seems

355
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the implementation of NFC on</font>

356
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,589
Android is actually pretty secure from a

357
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,600
remote perspective but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you get</font>

358
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">people it would you like to scan this</font>

359
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,040
tag would you like scan this QR code

360
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,770
things like that and people say yes and

361
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,689
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them anyways so we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

362
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,020
to convince the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user to open something</font>

363
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,960
and I've actually seen the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier's</font>

364
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,220
themselves get involved with this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

365
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of years ago maybe they've</font>

366
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,820
learned their lesson but I don't use

367
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,820
that carrier anymore the carrier wrote

368
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,890
me and said I could download a security

369
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,670
app of all things and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in a text</font>

370
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,590
message it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was from number like 1 2 3 4</font>

371
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,170
and it said download this there's a link

372
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,620
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text message and it sent me to</font>

373
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:14,040
you know mobile carrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm or</font>

374
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,500
something carrier calm and you know the

375
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,319
third party app store<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't send me</font>

376
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,660
a google play which is the cardinal sin

377
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of security we always tell people try</font>

378
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the official app stores you</font>

379
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're not perfect but at least</font>

380
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,120
they're trying and here it was the

381
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,370
carrier was telling me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out and use</font>

382
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,410
a different app store so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not much</font>

383
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,040
approve of that that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

384
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,610
telling us

385
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,500
city the wrong thing and then if we can

386
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,529
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to install an app like in</font>

387
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,100
that case malicious apps particularly on

388
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:49,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android if the API is for Android they</font>

389
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,569
really just can kind of let you based on

390
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,480
the permission model do anything you

391
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:57,630
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm on my facebook today I had</font>

392
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,819
posted a new blog post and one of the

393
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,829
jailbreakers for iphone wrote me and

394
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,839
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> they well basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

395
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:05,939
complaining that hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> android is just</font>

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
so easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> compared to iphone and and</font>

397
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,589
that's absolutely true hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> android</font>

398
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,690
people say it's not even really hacking

399
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,579
which is why I obviously need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get an</font>

400
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,600
iOS hacking if people are going to take

401
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:20,130
me seriously but that said android<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

402
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most sold phone right now it's the</font>

403
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,779
easiest to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use i have all four I windows</font>

404
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,730
blackberry<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackberries usability is</font>

405
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,670
terrible don't use that one windows

406
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,470
mobile was pretty good when my android

407
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,319
broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one with my second</font>

408
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,740
phone iOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 I don't really like iOS</font>

409
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,959
before that from a usability standpoint

410
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,870
android<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the easiest for the layperson</font>

411
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,989
to pick up and use it's also the easiest

412
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to develop for and that said it's also</font>

413
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,760
the easiest right malware for but it is

414
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to write malicious apps for all</font>

415
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,970
of them android just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easiest to</font>

416
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,760
upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to their store or install it</font>

417
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,920
through a third party but it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

418
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,220
to write malicious apps for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

419
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,629
of food but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write malicious</font>

420
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,490
apps and I'm hopefully going to write

421
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,890
one for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google glass very soon and</font>

422
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will be kind of stuck hacking</font>

423
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,360
because it's not really any different

424
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:17,699
from hacking the phone but it's google

425
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,740
glass so it's exciting but just a few

426
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:25,140
things on the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says things you</font>

427
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:28,409
can do you can make them steal data from

428
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,220
the phone you can remotely control it

429
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:35,130
like my original SMS botnet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

430
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,630
years ago which was at the baseband

431
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,570
level but you can also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the</font>

432
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">app level it just made it send a text</font>

433
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,200
message like you could dress grab

434
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,690
everybody's contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> cinematheque sausage</font>

435
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,850
great way to infect other people and

436
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,750
it's you know taking that circle of

437
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,760
trust

438
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,260
brogan on his head is like oh my boss

439
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,660
just sent me this and told me to

440
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,650
download it I'd better do it as opposed

441
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:02,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just some random number and that</font>

442
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,590
question I heard please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's a</font>

443
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,660
suggestion for a net why don't you

444
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,899
create some sort of strobe effect that

445
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:15,240
makes people<font color="#CCCCCC"> violently ill inside your</font>

446
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:17,010
google glasses could you repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font>

447
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,950
wants you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write an app</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you remember</font>

448
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened Japanese kids with the</font>

449
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,560
anime and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people kevin epileptic</font>

450
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,140
fits at certain highways haha strobe

451
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,850
effect the brit wants you to do this to

452
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,720
people that have google glasses to make

453
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,830
them boil GI life plenty of epilepsy

454
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,200
geo-located specifics only while they're

455
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,370
driving or taking there were shooting

456
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,950
guns well perhaps in a certain region of

457
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,290
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's here series a little</font>

458
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,960
facetious well it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good proof</font>

459
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,230
of concept I it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that show</font>

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,940
revenge the guy had glasses and he

461
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,770
watched somebody type in a password on

462
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,240
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna see if I can turn</font>

463
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,220
on my camera in the background without

464
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,670
turning on the light kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing but</font>

465
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,790
yeah making it so to make you before you

466
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,220
could turn into a genuine crypto whereby

467
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,620
you might get a sink that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with someone</font>

468
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,710
was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be real world</font>

469
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,989
applications groups graphic ones yeah

470
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll definitely look into that when is</font>

471
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,930
this conference over you guys going home

472
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,690
today or<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow um well after your</font>

473
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,990
presentation there is one more on

474
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:31,200
killing SCADA ICS the bar is<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

475
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,330
open dinner and stuff will be here and

476
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">then who the hell knows so you've got</font>

477
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,310
time to draw yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like if I got there</font>

478
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:44,850
in like eight hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could still be</font>

479
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:47,850
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font>

480
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">we better do the presentation so what</font>

481
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,560
we're actually gonna see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the demo for</font>

482
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,050
today is we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the last one</font>

483
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,240
attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> other devices there's a lot of</font>

484
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,190
videos out there I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> messing with</font>

485
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff for years so there's a lot of</font>

486
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,520
videos out there a bit doing all sorts

487
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,410
of stuff

488
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,840
the bulb security site there there you

489
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,760
look at my old presentations but we're

490
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to look at it being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used as a</font>

491
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:17,280
pivot today so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how do we</font>

492
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,340
get an app easily that users will likely

493
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,680
install they'll likely trust and how can

494
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do this easily of course we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

495
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">build an app manually or we might want</font>

496
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,680
to replace an app that they already have

497
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,110
or make it look like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort</font>

498
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,420
of app that they might want and trust

499
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,550
you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of the master key</font>

500
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,120
vulnerability on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android earlier this</font>

501
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,139
year it got you know a ton of press

502
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,209
probably because they use the term

503
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,400
master key even though it<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font>

504
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,830
anything to do with master keys but you

505
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">know PR people are smarter than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me they</font>

506
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more press whatever but basically it</font>

507
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,660
the vulnerability allowed you to replace

508
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,200
another app that's already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device</font>

509
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,880
and it would Android would check the

510
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,740
signatures for it and it would say they

511
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,540
were correct even though you had

512
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,370
modified it potentially put in a

513
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">backdoor some other malicious</font>

514
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,959
functionality but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android would say yes</font>

515
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,689
this is an update<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the real app but</font>

516
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,880
you never had access to the keys for it

517
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,980
you've never had to developer key so

518
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,330
anyone who knows anything about crypto

519
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,770
should say this should not work you

520
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to sign something</font>

521
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,270
without having the private key but you

522
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,120
know the technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of why this</font>

523
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,790
worked on google for but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it</font>

524
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,830
did and it has been patched but if

525
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,420
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with android ninety-nine</font>

526
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,280
point nine percent of the vices you're

527
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,470
going to run into it hasn't been patched

528
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,870
yet all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones in my house that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

529
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,750
bought since that<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch came out yes we</font>

530
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,360
have it all the ones before that no we

531
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,070
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have one android here that's my</font>

532
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,370
mom's android i bought her a new one

533
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:57,000
because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost this phone but</font>

534
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,800
it is on android 2.1 and it thinks it's

535
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,990
up to date and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even two years</font>

536
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">old yet so technically she was still in</font>

537
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:07,500
contract when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just took this phone</font>

538
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,060
from her voter a new one um so this

539
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,920
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our users they're still</font>

540
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,690
vulnerable to old stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we knew</font>

541
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they can't even try and patch</font>

542
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,210
it which is is terrible but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

543
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,250
master key vulnerability I did write

544
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,230
something I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put out a blog post on</font>

545
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,600
it that goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the script but</font>

546
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what it will do is decompile</font>

547
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,610
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> android app and it will add back door</font>

548
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,799
code and it will put it back together

549
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,049
and it will sign it either with master

550
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,179
key either with one of your keys or

551
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:38,549
whatever you want to sign it with so it

552
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,440
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original app so as</font>

553
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,720
far as the user can tell and if you use

554
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,570
master key as far as even the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

555
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,529
system can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's vulnerable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

556
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:51,450
the original app but it in fact has some

557
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,389
additional functionality so the one I

558
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,470
have for the example is ABC<font color="#E5E5E5"> News so</font>

559
00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:01,830
it'll actually get news and stuff but it

560
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,240
also talks to me so I put my SPF stuff

561
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,980
in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do this</font>

562
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,750
programmatically all you have to do is

563
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,059
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what apt to do you may find</font>

564
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,340
random cases where developers develop

565
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,139
something really weird and my algorithm

566
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,389
doesn't know how to handle it but I

567
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:18,209
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've pretty much got every normal</font>

568
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:21,000
case of how you build an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android app how</font>

569
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:24,179
to do it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> means prove me wrong and</font>

570
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,070
find one that it can't do so we're going

571
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at my little smartphone pen test</font>

572
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,529
framework which is nice little open

573
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,389
source tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I currently have a real</font>

574
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:35,010
developer working on it so we're

575
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:36,990
actually getting a real command-line

576
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,750
interface and the GUI is going to come

577
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,700
back and it's greatly greatly going to

578
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,549
expand so if you have played with it

579
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,019
before wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few weeks and then play</font>

580
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,779
with it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's going to get</font>

581
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,460
much much better as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the guy was</font>

582
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">like well it's called framework but you</font>

583
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,820
have no way for people to hook up

584
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,699
modules like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to write</font>

585
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,710
that so I have a real developer doing it

586
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,779
now and once you know he<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets the</font>

587
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,760
framework in place I can just follow it

588
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,269
I'm really good at like mimicking what

589
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,549
good developers do so SPF<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going it</font>

590
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:10,470
much much better but it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

591
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,500
cool I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're into menu based</font>

592
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:15,929
stuff which a lot of people who are very

593
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical or not whereas a lot of people</font>

594
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,130
who aren't very technical really like

595
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,580
the menu based so I guess it really just

596
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:26,429
depends whether you like it or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

597
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,678
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what SPF is designed to do is</font>

598
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,910
automate exploitation for mobile devices

599
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,460
it's basically

600
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,920
meant to be metasploit for mobile

601
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,690
devices as of right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now most of it is</font>

602
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Android there's a little bit for</font>

603
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,370
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the windows phone and the</font>

604
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,930
blackberry I got the months ago and I

605
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,959
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm going to put stuff for</font>

606
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:48,900
them on there I will I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font>

607
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,750
it the ideas that will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

608
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,240
every known vulnerability for all four

609
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:57,930
platforms as well as take advantage of

610
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,930
every API on all four platforms as well

611
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,940
as give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to build your own</font>

612
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,250
exploit so kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit like</font>

613
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,700
shellcode kind of way where you know

614
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:11,670
here's the shellcode for arm to do like

615
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,680
download and install kind of thing so a

616
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,900
lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to add to it and</font>

617
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,090
that I'm hopefully going to get done

618
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,060
this year but you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

619
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,949
go but it is open source and it is now

620
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,190
written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python when I first put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

621
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,950
out it was in Perl everybody hated that

622
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,690
and then I put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python and nobody's</font>

623
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,730
complained about hating it but they have

624
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,560
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually turned into any patches to</font>

625
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,110
it either so I don't know what the point

626
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,450
was of changing it but of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

627
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,780
stuff in the mobile devices is in Java

628
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,730
for Android and<font color="#E5E5E5"> objective ce4 for iOS</font>

629
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,370
and whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are a programmer</font>

630
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,970
and what a help<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

631
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:54,030
your help<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might even pay you actually</font>

632
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:55,860
but it does like it has the build

633
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,660
malicious apps in there it has it'll

634
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,260
hook up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit there's really not</font>

635
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:04,650
much for mobile in<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit right now</font>

636
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:07,620
so that's kind of not much to it it'll

637
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">also what I think it's cool that it lets</font>

638
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,500
you use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device you already</font>

639
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,750
have for communication um so instead of

640
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,060
having to buy some weird thing just in

641
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,280
mobile attacks you can either use your

642
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,260
own phone or get like a USB modem and

643
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,510
put your sim card in it and it'll hook

644
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,460
up to that automatically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

645
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,910
to worry about buying any special

646
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,830
software or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

647
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,870
what we're going to talk about

648
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,730
specifically today though I've just

649
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,110
ranted on for 30 minutes already we're

650
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,840
going to talk about using the mobile

651
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,669
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically as a pivot so we've</font>

652
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,439
gotten on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device through a</font>

653
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,810
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack through a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> client side</font>

654
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,840
through

655
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,450
social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way somehow we</font>

656
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,030
ought on the mobile device that I've

657
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,740
done talks we're all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

658
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,360
ways to get on the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device we</font>

659
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,570
talked about it briefly here but I'm not

660
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um let's say you're on the</font>

661
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,280
device we're in a network doesn't matter

662
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,110
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's home network or work neck</font>

663
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">network I assure you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's probably a</font>

664
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,949
vulnerability and I assure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

665
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,350
there's probably something interesting

666
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,300
you want regardless for you end up be at

667
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,159
the coffee network you know the coffee

668
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,200
networks probably got more interesting

669
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,330
information than<font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere he's got</font>

670
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">people from every company that's nearby</font>

671
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:26,379
there so we are on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and we</font>

672
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,360
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have direct network access to every</font>

673
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,900
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> device around me we just need to</font>

674
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,409
find vulnerability and I showed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sky</font>

675
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">dock on let's see where is it well I</font>

676
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:43,630
showed this at skydog<font color="#E5E5E5"> con where I used</font>

677
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:47,439

680
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:56,199
it's somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud somewhere</font>

681
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,180
and it is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control device</font>

682
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,240
or that first<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone at the top that's</font>

683
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,610
my phone that it's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of SPF which</font>

684
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,650
talks to the cell tower which talks to

685
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,159
an infected mobile device that's been

686
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:12,550
infected by something through SPF and is

687
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,770
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a nearby computer so it's on</font>

688
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,570
somebody's local network and it's

689
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,139
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a nearby a computer it</font>

690
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,520
exploits that computer will see a demo

691
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,800
of it but instead of having that

692
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,389
computer just use typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell code and</font>

693
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,870
just call out to some listener on the

694
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,640
internet and then you see that red and

695
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,429
access point that's the perimeter in a

696
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,010
filtering or content inspection that

697
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:38,140
they have there we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal</font>

698
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:41,080
with it accordingly they might be able

699
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to stop us log something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit does</font>

700
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,820
a pretty good job of getting through

701
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,399
most content inspections but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

702
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,590
case I did have it instead have the

703
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,680
shellcode call back it was just a

704
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit reverse shell just an inline</font>

705
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,760
so it called back to a listener on this

706
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,389
infected phone here at the

707
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,520
bottom so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calling out like</font>

708
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,100
that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> having it call back out</font>

709
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,139
through the network I had it call back

710
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone so i just opened up a tcp</font>

711
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,280
listener on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infected phone you can</font>

712
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,169

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet she was open a tcp listener and</font>

717
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,210
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically funneled into text</font>

718
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,000
messages so I had it send background

719
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,250
text messages out back to that control

720
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,250
phone at the top which forwarded it on

721
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,380
to SPF so if you find the sky dog con

722
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,140
video everybody accuses me of being

723
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,120
wasted I actually wasn't the drink that

724
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,190
I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage was the first one I had</font>

725
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,590
that an entire day baby people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I</font>

726
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,060
was drunk I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just excited that it</font>

727
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,240
works because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something a little</font>

728
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit crazy about doing a live demo or the</font>

729
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,540
cell towers have to be on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> side but</font>

730
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,710
I put it off so that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it</font>

731
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,110
can do we're not going to demo that

732
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,670
today because like holding up all this

733
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,370
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of the screen of silly</font>

734
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,690
and it doesn't work very well on

735
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,570
emulators but there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

736
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,820
working what we're going to do is is

737
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,919
basically this one and which is pretty

738
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing without the cell</font>

739
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,380
towers having to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much but</font>

740
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically how this first one works what</font>

741
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,880
we need to do is compile exploit code to

742
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,639
run on the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

743
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,410
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something this guy who is</font>

744
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,480
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> my blog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> post that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with</font>

745
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,040
sometimes on exploit development had

746
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,160
this great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's like well why</font>

747
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,260
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just basically use TCP</font>

748
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,050
tunneling to send the traffic straight

749
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,640
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit rather than all these</font>

750
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,490
extra steps so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm working on something</font>

751
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you can avoid the C code problem</font>

752
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,230
but as of right now you have to have C

753
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,300
code his mobile phones don't have Python

754
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,700
and Perl and Ruby interpreters and

755
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,340
whatnot but they can run c code they

756
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,530
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> underneath it all everything</font>

757
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,659
except the windows phone is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

758
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,980
don't know where blackberry is the iOS

759
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,230
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> android the major players they</font>

760
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,510
are just linux kernel's really

761
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,580
underneath so they can run compiled<font color="#CCCCCC"> c</font>

762
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,470
code if they're compiled with the right

763
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,510
compiler by this come

764
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,340
on my linux box obviously that won't

765
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,440
work because these are arm bones and

766
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,240
they will understand the assembly but

767
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,010
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross compilers for arm and</font>

768
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,500
whatnot so i can just compile it with a

769
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,049
cost cross compiler drop it onto the

770
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,809
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> device and every app has the</font>

771
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:33,629
ability to store files so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can just</font>

772
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,460
download something from somewhere and

773
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,100
download it and save it and Mark it is

774
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,140
executable and then run it so i can run

775
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,439
exploit code as long as it's compiled

776
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,480
appropriately so my main downside to

777
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,580
that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to port my exploits</font>

778
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,260
to see which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

779
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,689
working on fixing that right now like I

780
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,640
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just allowing you to send any</font>

781
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:59,559
exploit that you want through the mobile

782
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,020
pivot and so then we can catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

783
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,899
basically for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i just have</font>

784
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,299
the shellcode i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just it's</font>

785
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,210
windows meterpreter reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP the</font>

786
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,340
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit payload and I put the</font>

787
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">El host options so the who is going to</font>

788
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,879
call back to I said as the IP address of

789
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,760
in my case kali linux where I'm running

790
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,880
SPF so to catch it so it's just kind of

791
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,770
traditional network exploitation except

792
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,600
it's happening through a phone which I

793
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,799
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have direct network access but i</font>

794
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,408
do have mobile network access to then

795
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,210
again then this is even more exciting

796
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can avoid the perimeter so i</font>

797
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,370
can basically avoid I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp/ip</font>

798
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:45,730
communication all together a set for

799
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:47,199
between this computer and the infected

800
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,179
mobile device which is all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

801
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network so while they may be</font>

802
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing some network monitoring most</font>

803
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,140
people even people are doing security

804
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,360
right mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with is it leaving is</font>

805
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,309
it coming in because that's where it

806
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,408
gets interesting you know if two

807
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:04,658
computers an infected computer talking

808
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:06,760
to another infected computer inside the

809
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:09,340
same network shouldn't be giving anybody

810
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,620
anything so there is monitoring of that

811
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,689
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see they're</font>

812
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just checking on the perimeter so</font>

813
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:19,450
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can avoid the perimeter we can</font>

814
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:21,610
make it even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more exciting so basically</font>

815
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,169
like I said open a listener catch the

816
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,030
shell on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the listener on the device and</font>

817
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">then send it out / sm</font>

818
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,889
so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit slow if you watch</font>

819
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video i think it's got maybe a one</font>

820
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,080
or two second delay but that's as fast

821
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,000
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tone plug and the poem plug you</font>

822
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,909
have to go drop it this walks in by

823
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,830
itself in someone's hands so it's

824
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:45,010
basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same concept as a phone</font>

825
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,360
plug except it's somebody's actual

826
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,430
device so we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

827
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,580
being in that physical location and

828
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,440
having the ability to drop it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

829
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,270
other possible communication methods

830
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,150
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on basically</font>

831
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've probably heard a bad bios which</font>

832
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,550
is another like weird this name thing

833
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,070
that basically a PR person came up with

834
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,930
the name for that as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell</font>

835
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:10,690
but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story behind bad bios</font>

836
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:13,570
was that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that it may possibly</font>

837
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,580
have been admitting like ultra whatever

838
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,429
like outside of what dogs here whatever

839
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,100
that is sounds so it didn't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

840
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,350
any communication method like via the

841
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:27,009
network because it was talking basically

842
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,350
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sounds pretty absurd in that</font>

843
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,940
case but there has been like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ian amit</font>

844
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,668
did some research a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

845
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,350
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> he used like boy it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

846
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:36,879
VoIP network so they would use their

847
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,690
conferencing called it would call out

848
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,120
and it would transmit like sip commands

849
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,540
to send their<font color="#E5E5E5"> command-and-control so</font>

850
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,460
voice stuff is possible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

851
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,409
the phone it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly</font>

852
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,330
possible if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can start a coal in the</font>

853
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,820
background and then have it basically

854
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,790
use text-to-speech even<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

855
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then have it catch basically like</font>

856
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sown at the bottom make a call the</font>

857
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,930
phone at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top or vice versa and have</font>

858
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,270
it go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that way so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm kind of</font>

859
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,560
looking into that it's another thing on

860
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,930
my list NFC as well android really seems

861
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,520
to want to lock down NFC tag stuff to

862
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,620
keep you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this sort of stuff</font>

863
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,870
so it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's at least going to</font>

864
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,299
require some social engineering to make

865
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:25,089
the NFC's that's work but it's like if

866
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,370
I'm close enough like outside maybe with

867
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,340
a really strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag transmitter could i</font>

868
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,529
get an infected vote to send me stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

869
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,300
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm working on and you</font>

870
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,550
know bluetooth everybody loves to hack

871
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,140
blue too so i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if i can</font>

872
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,150
get somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pair to me</font>

873
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,759
then yes I can get it to send me stuff

874
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,339
but again I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be at</font>

875
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">least have some controller that's nearby</font>

876
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:52,940
enough so these are other communication

877
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,618
methods that want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with basically</font>

878
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,359
in the end though and have every

879
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:00,260
communication method any mobile device

880
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:02,359
has and they could do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but</font>

881
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,910
as of right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really only worked</font>

882
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:07,069
with traditional network and my favorite

883
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,859
text messages I've made text message

884
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">just do all sorts of nasty stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

885
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some demos that's</font>

886
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,980
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up at the end but let's</font>

887
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,200
look at some demos and hopefully my

888
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,940
computer will behave my computer has

889
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">been telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a new</font>

890
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,109
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a very long time I'm not sure</font>

891
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,760
why it has eight gigs of memory it

892
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,799
shouldn't be behaving this way but it

893
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,760
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to want to run very many</font>

894
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:34,490
things very often but i do have android

895
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,630
emulator one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this one here this</font>

896
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:40,459
is the SPF app so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled by</font>

897
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,349
the pen tester so the pen tester

898
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,730
basically needs to have some computer or

899
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:49,700
tablet or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's running SPF</font>

900
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:53,029
and also some mobile device so be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

901
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,578
smartphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they own or you can</font>

902
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:57,640
again USB connect so you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

903
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:00,289
one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little USB modem things and</font>

904
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,720
put your sim card in it and it'll talk

905
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:04,849
through there as well we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way</font>

906
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,680
to if you want to send any mobile based

907
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:09,619
attacks you need something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

908
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,308
we've got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here we also have</font>

909
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the victim it says its android</font>

910
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:18,650
2.2 it doesn't make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference the</font>

911
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:20,769
lower number androids just run faster

912
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,470
they don't take as much processing power

913
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:26,149
like try running KitKat emulator and try

914
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:30,259
doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else on your computer and</font>

915
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far you get and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have Kali</font>

916
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux here with SPF on it so I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

917
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:41,690
SPF right here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also have this is</font>

918
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:44,210
just a vm that i use for exploit dev

919
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,670
class and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> password is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password i</font>

920
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,619
apparently can't even type<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and and I</font>

921
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,599
just this is just the example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

922
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:53,359
because I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write in C code</font>

923
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:57,920
and this was one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did in C code</font>

924
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:00,619
to exploit war ftp 1.65 which is pretty

925
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the catch-all first exploit dev</font>

926
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:05,390
exploit anybody ever does<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it my</font>

927
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,700
class so to San so does<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cortland so to</font>

928
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,440
sue meal so does everybody because it's

929
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,629
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before you know</font>

930
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,640
anything it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to write the</font>

931
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:16,519
exploit for hence why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use that one</font>

932
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,859
because I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write and see so</font>

933
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,450
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an example anything</font>

934
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">that at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point that you can write</font>

935
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:26,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> C code for you should be able to do</font>

936
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:28,940
this or but this is again just an

937
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,249
example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually in the SPF</font>

938
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,319
repositories the code for this so you

939
00:38:31,249 --> 00:38:36,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">can set this up yourself if you wanted</font>

940
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:42,288
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with it I'm so this is just XP</font>

941
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:46,099
with that so I already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this device</font>

942
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:48,319
attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and I can just like show</font>

943
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,509
you how easy it is to backdoor an app so

944
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:53,808
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to backdoor android.apk</font>

945
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:56,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with agent just asked me what app I want</font>

946
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:59,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back door so i just downloaded ABC</font>

947
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">news i pulled it off my phone it rips it</font>

948
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:08,839
apart with apktool and then it puts

949
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,480
basically the code from my android agent

950
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:14,450
and the original app together and smiley

951
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,739
and makes you automatically start my

952
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:21,470
code in the background<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it asks</font>

953
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">me for some information basically who's</font>

954
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,249
the controller for this so basically

955
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:28,730
what phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number can talk to it it'll</font>

956
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:31,549
only talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one phone so I give it the</font>

957
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:34,369
phone number of this guy it'll only

958
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:36,619
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me it also takes control key</font>

959
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:38,269
key key one is a terrible key i really

960
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:41,690
need to switch this out for real crypto

961
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:44,779
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really high on my list and</font>

962
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:47,269
where can<font color="#CCCCCC"> it check in over HTTP so it</font>

963
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:50,509
can do SMS through that phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number or</font>

964
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:52,758
HTTP through a web server so it'll

965
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:57,339
change those values in the actual app

966
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:57,339
and then it will build it back together

967
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,750
and when it finishes it will ask you do

968
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use master key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also say no</font>

969
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:15,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then it will let you sign it with</font>

970
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:18,080
your default key whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is and then</font>

971
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,270
you get them to install it somehow I

972
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,980
actually already downloaded it over here

973
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:28,330
earlier just to make sure everything was

974
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">good so and it's just the ABC News app</font>

975
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:38,689
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install and it says</font>

976
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:40,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's installed so we say open and here</font>

977
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,950
it looks like ABC News it's even

978
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,720
actually going to let me download I get

979
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:48,379
most of my news from testing this

980
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,779
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it tells me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

981
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">latest news is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i open it sure why</font>

982
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">not and sure why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you just let it</font>

983
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,070
track me too so rat-infested goat ship

984
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">eludes trackers so I learned something</font>

985
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,160
about what's going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world today</font>

986
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,339
because you know I rarely leave my

987
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,520
office because I back toward this app

988
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:11,000
but it also has the SPF functionality in

989
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,860
it as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I tell SPF to attach to</font>

990
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,930
a deployed agent and I give it the

991
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,660
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i gave it when I built</font>

992
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:21,109
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android agent one and</font>

993
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,649
the key was Kiki one and communication

994
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:27,110
HTTP or SMS let's just do HTTP it's

995
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:30,080
faster well actually they're just as

996
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,660
fast for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the check-in but this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

997
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,790
HTTP we can also have it check in / SMS

998
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,460
so again we can avoid the perimeter

999
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">altogether so what it's going to do is</font>

1000
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,360
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically do a three-way handshake</font>

1001
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,000
with this guy to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it can</font>

1002
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,280
communicate so the user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this device</font>

1003
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,320
sees no indication that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1004
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,520
happening then they can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> close the</font>

1005
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,440
app it's still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in the</font>

1006
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">background basically it just has</font>

1007
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,520
something that listens for incoming text

1008
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,200
messages and it periodically calls out

1009
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,020
to a web server to see if it has any

1010
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,750
communication so typical botnet and then

1011
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,730
typical SMS botnet all rolled into one

1012
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,250
with a bunch of payloads that's

1013
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:09,380
basically all this is but it does take a

1014
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,050
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it to finish the check-in</font>

1015
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,210
because it basically tries for a little

1016
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,390
while and I haven't said so once it gets

1017
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,599
in

1018
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:22,308
answer it stops it's just set to wait

1019
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,200
for 60 seconds so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means i have to</font>

1020
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:27,010
like actually come up with something to

1021
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:32,808
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we wait this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the part</font>

1022
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:35,049
sadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> georgia there's a question yeah if</font>

1023
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:40,220
you actually spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone at all yet</font>

1024
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:43,160
that arm hmm but the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

1025
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,529
processes hmm not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a process a</font>

1026
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,529
problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked to</font>

1027
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:51,559
people at Google and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed</font>

1028
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:53,809
in KitKat they fixed my background text

1029
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,700
messages I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same attack</font>

1030
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,010
for like three years at the application

1031
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,129
level and they finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed it with</font>

1032
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,299
KitKat you have to basically if you have

1033
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,819
it you've probably seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1034
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,369
default text message app so the incoming

1035
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:09,650
intent it isn't an ordered broadcast

1036
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:12,200
anymore it will only go to that default

1037
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:15,019
app so it actually broke some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my SMS</font>

1038
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,029
stuff in KitKat that said unless you

1039
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:18,529
haven't just bought a device I feel like

1040
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:22,519
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about it for at</font>

1041
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:25,640
least another six months we have you met

1042
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:30,288
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key requirement on arm technology</font>

1043
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,410
they have introduced a content filtering

1044
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:36,400
chip and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe in their</font>

1045
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:41,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">next design you might consider making a</font>

1046
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">firewalling application for me I hadn't</font>

1047
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:45,349
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely look</font>

1048
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,779
into it I'm it's kind of my thing right

1049
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:50,029
now is I you know people make fun of me

1050
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:53,690
that's like Oh Jordan is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1051
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:56,410
application layer ah yeah the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1052
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:59,059
to contact them<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you can babe any</font>

1053
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:02,000
suspicious calls is a detection in it

1054
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:04,279
and we can stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happening yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1055
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,980
definitely want to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that so</font>

1056
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:08,720
yeah I'll write that<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and see cuz</font>

1057
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,190
yeah I want to do stuff that's more

1058
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,660
because I originally did stuff with the

1059
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,970
baseband layer and that was more

1060
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,769
exciting so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper and</font>

1061
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,439
start doing stuff like at the chip level

1062
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:22,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beauty night once again the services</font>

1063
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:26,599
or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lesson on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room control at the</font>

1064
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:28,320
way the internal operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and service SMS</font>

1065
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:32,790
the doesn't appear is

1066
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:36,930
normal message oh the I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1067
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything with it but that's my answer to</font>

1068
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:42,270
what i'm going to do or try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do now</font>

1069
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:45,960
that I can't with<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitkat and I assume</font>

1070
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,430
later that I can't just grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order</font>

1071
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,980
broadcast that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to</font>

1072
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:52,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a server service message</font>

1073
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,810
instead so I haven't implemented it yet

1074
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the idea i had to face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a host</font>

1075
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:03,720
you think you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to learn those</font>

1076
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:08,070
this time I I haven't tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly</font>

1077
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,680
um let's see so it checked in so there's

1078
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,590
the phone number of it so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can talk</font>

1079
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,660
to it these are all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1080
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:18,060
can make it do as right now all the

1081
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,040
payloads I've written so you can

1082
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,590
actually like pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap off of it or</font>

1083
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,420
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can see what</font>

1084
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,910
apps are on there like you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1085
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,270
the installed packages and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1086
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,490
upload one and then do like a pen test

1087
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:35,280
on it to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vulnerability and what</font>

1088
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of ridiculous stuff I like to</font>

1089
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:44,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">write sometimes but let's actually start</font>

1090
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:48,360
by compiling this code to run so I have

1091
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:52,350
like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this war ftp</font>

1092
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:54,990
meterpreter<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just really ugly c</font>

1093
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,089
code that attacks war<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp and it's just</font>

1094
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,100
got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> shellcode i dropped in which</font>

1095
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,420
the shellcode can be for the windows box

1096
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,460
because that's where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going</font>

1097
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,570
to execute I just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compile this</font>

1098
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,070
exploit to run mobile device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because</font>

1099
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,650
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a really hard time with</font>

1100
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cross compilers after I got one built I</font>

1101
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put it in SPF um so I want to</font>

1102
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:25,950
compile<font color="#E5E5E5"> root smartphones and test</font>

1103
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:31,200
framework and exploits windows and it's

1104
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:32,790
war ftp mature<font color="#CCCCCC"> pritcher dot C and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1105
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:38,609
just put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a desktop because that</font>

1106
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:41,940
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier or ftp meterpreter and</font>

1107
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:44,250
at 37 morning since i'm a bad coder well

1108
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,680
new but it did actually compile it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1109
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:50,640
go up there it says these are just

1110
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,919
warnings without me using bad stuff but

1111
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,049
it did actually compile it so then what

1112
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,480
i can do is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop it so if i go</font>

1113
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,750
to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> commands the agent and then I</font>

1114
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:06,210
tell it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to download a file file</font>

1115
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:10,290
to download root desktop or ftp

1116
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:12,060
meterpreter and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to put it</font>

1117
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,829
on the web server I don't care so I just

1118
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:19,230
kind of go like this I would I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1119
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:22,109
call it or FCP meterpreter and let's

1120
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have it delivered over HTTP so that</font>

1121
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:26,279
will tell it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> download this file it</font>

1122
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,160
will put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the files directory of</font>

1123
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,319
that application every application is

1124
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,750
allowed to download file it has internet

1125
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:37,290
it can call out but it can store files

1126
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,760
locally in its own private directory but

1127
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:42,750
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically on the Senate is</font>

1128
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,660
executable so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll run give it a min</font>

1129
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:51,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">load and make sure this guy is running</font>

1130
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:53,790
and this guy's IP address is what you

1131
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:56,369
can also run in map like you saw the

1132
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:58,200
list that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will run in map so we can find</font>

1133
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:59,849
out without there and what not um

1134
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,129
because there's actually already in that

1135
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:09,720
for android I'd have to build anything

1136
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:11,670
for that tend up<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0206 alright alright so</font>

1137
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,419
the next thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

1138
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,920
want to execute a command there's also

1139
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,589
like execute a command and upload

1140
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,839
results and there's also like runnin map

1141
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:24,180
which will download and map execute in

1142
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,990
map and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload the result so you</font>

1143
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:31,770
can kind of like build specific things

1144
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:33,299
to do lots of stuff together but I just

1145
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,369
want to execute command there's not

1146
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,680
going to be any output so execute

1147
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:40,859
command<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's fine so the command is</font>

1148
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,540
war ftp meterpreter and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote this</font>

1149
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,279
I have to give it the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1150
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:48,000
port that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know based on the</font>

1151
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:52,349
exploit code you wrote this is how I did

1152
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,690
it 21 for that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure i</font>

1153
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:55,980
have a listener so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did just open up</font>

1154
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:59,010
metasploit over here

1155
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,730
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just MSF console and I just did</font>

1156
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:04,920
use multi handler set the pelota windows

1157
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,530
meterpreter reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> gcp which is the</font>

1158
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,780
same one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that shellcode here</font>

1159
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,970
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just shellcode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I generated</font>

1160
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,000
with MSF venom so a lot of the same

1161
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:18,689
things we did before are all the same

1162
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,240
set the<font color="#CCCCCC"> El host option and so it's</font>

1163
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,910
listening so this could be somewhere out

1164
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,450
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud as long as my victim here</font>

1165
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:29,250
has internet access has the ability to

1166
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,680
call out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet you know you</font>

1167
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,750
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this like with HTTPS traffic</font>

1168
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,310
with metasploit as well and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1169
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:39,690
most content inspection filters and so

1170
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">metasploit has all of this in place</font>

1171
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,200
we're really just dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1172
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,180
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> side so I do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a listener if</font>

1173
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,060
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes well I should get shell</font>

1174
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,190
over here so let's go ahead and run this

1175
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it asked me was this command</font>

1176
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:54,450
downloaded because it will let you run

1177
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:56,910
system binaries as well as long as the

1178
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,890
app has the permission to do so but this

1179
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,118
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> was downloaded so it needs to know</font>

1180
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:03,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it needs to pull it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

1181
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:07,170
files directory I say yes delivery

1182
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:09,000
method HTTP and it should tell it to run

1183
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,710
that and exploit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and assuming I</font>

1184
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,350
didn't screw up my shell code which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

1185
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:16,500
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> known to do we should see this</font>

1186
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:18,750
thing explode here in a second so it

1187
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,880
isn't instantaneous you can change

1188
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,830
everything to be instantaneous but just

1189
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,540
because of battery issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have it by</font>

1190
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:29,490
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> it already checks in once a</font>

1191
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:33,330
minute um show I just got a text message

1192
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:35,220
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my real phone that's exciting so we</font>

1193
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,440
see it did get exploited over here war

1194
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,629
ftp shows that it was exploited just

1195
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,730
shows a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nonsense here the fact</font>

1196
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:44,040
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still alive and didn't die</font>

1197
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,720
makes me believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually worked</font>

1198
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasionally when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've shown this I've</font>

1199
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,350
screwed up my shell code or an IP

1200
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:53,700
address changed like if you watch the

1201
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:55,529
video from hackfest I IP addresses just

1202
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,500
kept changing because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot my access</font>

1203
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:00,210
point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just disaster what this</font>

1204
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,760
looks like it should have worked so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1205
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,560
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit here i indeed</font>

1206
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,420
do have meterpreter if you're not

1207
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,870
familiar with meterpreter it's basically

1208
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,970
a command shell with extra functionality

1209
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:14,190
there is meterpreter for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android it just</font>

1210
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:17,339
doesn't do very much my android agents

1211
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:19,620
are much more powerful but since we've

1212
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,720
actually exploited a windows box we have

1213
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,480
windows meterpreter so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point</font>

1214
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,370
everything will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your traditional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen</font>

1215
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing things you've just avoided</font>

1216
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:32,490
having to do social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> or find</font>

1217
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:35,360
a client-side attack or anything on this

1218
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:38,100
windows box it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably behind that</font>

1219
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,130
and whatever corporate controls they

1220
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:43,529
have so we've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> used the phone to</font>

1221
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:50,520
exploit it so you know we could do

1222
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:52,970
wicked let's see um let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just people</font>

1223
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,080
tell me that when I'm talking to

1224
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,730
corporate business<font color="#E5E5E5"> II people that I</font>

1225
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,319
should actually make it do things so you

1226
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we're a hacker conferences like</font>

1227
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,960
meterpreter that's done but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1228
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:07,379
the password hashes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sauce what</font>

1229
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,340
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ghana mimi cats um it doesn't</font>

1230
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,410
have many cuts for that oh um well

1231
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this one might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just updated</font>

1232
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:19,920
it but we got but like I could do

1233
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:22,020
anything that's on this list like I

1234
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,230
gotta take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a screenshot i could key scan</font>

1235
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:30,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">i could execute any command i'm actually</font>

1236
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:32,430
only a user um but you know you guys I

1237
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,620
watched you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys look like you</font>

1238
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,390
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're talking about so you</font>

1239
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:41,790
know at this point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control of</font>

1240
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:44,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> box right ok well im doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font>

1241
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:46,529
world so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i have to like change</font>

1242
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,779
something about the way i do these demos

1243
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,340
because the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time i went to a</font>

1244
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">business conference and I you know I</font>

1245
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,600
popped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trigger and nobody clapped</font>

1246
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,950
and I was like okay what do I do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1247
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,779
it's like I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read somebody's</font>

1248
00:52:55,950 --> 00:53:00,419
email or something so I need to set

1249
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:03,090
something up so it's more like oh that's

1250
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,890
what it's about but you guys have any

1251
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:07,740
advice on that please<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me know I'm</font>

1252
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:10,589
you know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a technical person so</font>

1253
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:14,279
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the password hashes hooray so</font>

1254
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:16,560
what we did in this demo was this first

1255
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,170
example we didn't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we did</font>

1256
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,570
this one so I talked to the phone it

1257
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,760
attacked this guy which sit it out just

1258
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,800
well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my case it's all the same local</font>

1259
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,980
or you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be a cloud</font>

1260
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,320
system out here my cali box somewhere

1261
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,180
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network and we would have</font>

1262
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,070
to deal with anything they had at the

1263
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,350
perimeter but metal it's pretty good

1264
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:41,040
i've only really had one pen test ever

1265
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:44,520
wear<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> https payload wasn't</font>

1267
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,290
detect proxy settings automatically so

1268
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,870
that's does usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough to get</font>

1269
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:54,990
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of most networks but just in case</font>

1270
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:58,770
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have this SMS option as</font>

1271
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:01,020
well up until KitKat which so KitKat

1272
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,180
device doesn't work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to try</font>

1273
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,670
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix it but you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never had</font>

1274
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,230
to so about time they fix the

1275
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,440
vulnerability I found three years ago

1276
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:13,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never know um so that's my dimmer</font>

1277
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,020
for today I hope it was exciting it's

1278
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,819
not as exciting as the SMS shell one but

1279
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:21,410
it pretty much accomplishes the same

1280
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:26,100
thing in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases the SMS shell is is</font>

1281
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:27,899
unnecessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is all I have for</font>

1282
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,509
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's my contact</font>

1283
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:34,140
information and I don't know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1284
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:36,120
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions but I just had my</font>

1285
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,339
website redone so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1286
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,950
information on there and people would

1287
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:43,440
complain the documentation on SPF used

1288
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:45,060
to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad in the process of</font>

writing my book where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a chapter</font>

on SPF<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually also wrote a pretty</font>

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in SPF contributing or</font>

1293
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,319
just using it or coming up with ideas

1294
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,000
and telling me to implement them please

1295
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,390
do let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgia home security</font>

see it well I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer emails</font>

1301
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,280
eventually but Twitter is pretty

1302
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:18,930
instantaneous with me if I'm awake so

1303
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,170
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have time for questions</font>

1304
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:23,310
but I will I'm open to taking them I

1307
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:32,130
good feedback so far I like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1308
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:34,860
about working with the ARM processor

1309
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:37,619
very much sir and also working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

the control system SMS

1311
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,940
I will hopefully implement both of those

1312
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:48,749
very soon and I'll blame it all on you

1313

1322
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:16,230
quick question in a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1323
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,839
author i love the demonstration you said

1324
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:20,940
something of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-frequency audio</font>

1325
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,859
being used as a covert communication

1326
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,269
channel and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more if</font>

1327
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:27,029
you have anything more to say but also i

1328
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:29,308
was wondering since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone companies</font>

1329
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:31,859
cut off high and<font color="#E5E5E5"> low frequency in order</font>

1330
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:34,799
to economize unbanned with how is that

1331
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:36,960
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what i was talking about</font>

1332
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,359
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1333
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,059
look up bad bios<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think most of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1334
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,640
probably made up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really think I</font>

1335
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:46,349
think it's possible like if you had I

1336
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,150
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a proof of</font>

1337
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,380
concept I think with two computers you

1338
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,650
could definitely likes it there

1339
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,720
microphones and and their speakers and

1340
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,489
make it happen but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really see it</font>

1341
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,618
as something that could work on the

1342
00:56:56,489 --> 00:57:01,890
whole is malware but just look up bad

1343
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,720
bios but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I was talking about I</font>

1344
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:06,180
don't want to do high and low frequency

1345
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,399
stuff I actually want to do text to

1346
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,430
speech and see how well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would work</font>

1347
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,739
like have my command go through the text

1348
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:15,960
to speech which is just built in so it's

1349
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:18,150
more of like just me being curious I

1350
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,279
guess to see if I can do it see if I can

1351
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,920
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a background call and then have it</font>

1352
00:57:20,279 --> 00:57:25,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually execute commands based on that</font>

1353
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,480
so it's just using a phone calls

1354
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:29,489
communication channel everything that

1355
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've actually seen done has been like</font>

1356
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:33,930
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sip command to what not like if you</font>

1357
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:37,410
look at in am it I guess he was at

1358
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:41,509
security art then it was a def con 2011

1359
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:44,129
he didn't talk on he used<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice</font>

1360
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:47,069
communication basically the same way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1361
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:50,130
use SMS to just avoid the perimeter to

1362
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:51,420
exfiltrate data or ginger shell out I

1363
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,069
think Georgia

1364
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,859
to be contacted by a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

1365
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:59,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a few really evil ideas what was</font>

1366
00:57:55,859 --> 00:58:03,029
that website from bad ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm and had</font>

00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">/ bad idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can also offer a quick</font>

1368
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,890
little bit of information starting about

1369
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:11,760
11 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we were seeing and being</font>

1370
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:13,558
shown really<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-quality spear phishing</font>

1371
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,990
emails so high quality that the ellipse

1372
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,390
sender couldn't tell whether he sent it

1373
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,160
or not in a number of cases and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1374
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,020
being accomplished by trojan I

1375
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,990
smartphone apps that were being used to

1376
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:29,009
capture email<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they could</font>
