00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,460
all right Jessa me I make the illusion

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,130
that we began in Sweden and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause we</font>

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,540
ended up in China and so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep our weight moving</font>

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,070
around the globe and George<font color="#CCCCCC"> sebastia has</font>

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,039
been a colleague and friend for 15 years

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,198
one way or another he knows the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middies</font>

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,810
which is certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a component of where</font>

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,090
this whole thing is evolving<font color="#E5E5E5"> and moving</font>

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,829
on couple the comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were made</font>

still hitting sitting here he was

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,190
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Chinese view of</font>

cultural understand the culture of your

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,839
adversaries ingratiate yourself into

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,120
their mindsets otherwise you're gonna

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,070
fail huge amount and we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,099
discussion is a number of us about the

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,309
cultural differences cyber war in the

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,660
Mideast so with that George<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sebastia</font>

please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay first thank you for the</font>

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,039
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here today I do</font>

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,869
apologize yesterday for being observed

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by working on the presentation so</font>

25
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,159
I did not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to much to network</font>

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,759
with you but I'll take advantage of the

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,619
time today to expand on that maybe being

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,860
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a perfectionist I just</font>

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,530
rewrite my presentation about 25 verses

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ohlins version 1.0 it should actually</font>

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,150
get like version 20 or something change

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,630
so we're going to be spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

next 45 minutes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,530
end there'll be time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or if</font>

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,619
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have questions as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,360
please feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interrupt me and</font>

37
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,240
there'll be maybe a few five minutes or

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,899
ten that will do a bit of odd you for

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:57,089
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we cannot</font>

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,619
always discuss on air so in terms of the

41
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,890
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to cover during</font>

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,270
this presentation involves things are

43
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,850
changing and we live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new world</font>

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,478
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to understand the</font>

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,099
implications of this world order the

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,800
Middle East is a bit different than the

47
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,540
rest of the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,330
different culturally is different and

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,519
how it approaches it is evolving at a

50
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,810
very fast pace electronically because it

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,940
has invested quite substantially in its

52
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,490
infrastructure I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I landed</font>

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,550
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle east over 20 years ago</font>

54
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,770
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada the time I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working for</font>

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,720
computer associates and I do remember

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,770
well that we were actually supporting

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,750
some customers by using facts technology

58
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,330
today when I Drive between Bahrain and

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,040
Riyadh I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do a skype call on</font>

60
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:54,000
three or 4g full video so the physical

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,630
tremendously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a war of equals so</font>

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,950
it's a highly a symmetrical war the

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,079
people in the Middle East are very

64
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,790
creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> and very resourceful so</font>

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,630
although some may be have very limited

66
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,549
resources there's they are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,859
very effective attacks against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,080
infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Middle East is</font>

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:18,510
about tribes tribal so one has to

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,830
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance has changed</font>

71
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">very fast and the wind of changes on us</font>

72
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,630
in the Middle East one other interesting

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,720
aspect about the cyber war in the Middle

74
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,510
East is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boundaries between the</font>

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,640
cyber world the world war of the packets

76
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,090
as we can call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the physical war</font>

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,399
is is interchangeable where you actually

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,989
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that in other cyber works is</font>

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,770
going through and then some time for Q&A

80
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:52,410
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new world order at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,989
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day one is expected that the</font>

82
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,459
new cyber warriors are really highly

83
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,890
equipped with very advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

84
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,100
weapons<font color="#E5E5E5"> when at the end we have very</font>

85
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,730
simple kids sometimes 16 or 19<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old</font>

86
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,320
that can cause as much disruption on the

87
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,649
other side way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> would we sometimes has</font>

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,209
been referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as the acts of evil</font>

89
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:16,560
creates new alliances that we actually

90
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to defend ourselves against it but</font>

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">occurred to that I think I lights our</font>

92
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,060
business probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than any others</font>

93
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,460
and I'm a fan of it it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spy vs 5</font>

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,420
in the sense that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually live in a</font>

95
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,340
connected world

96
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,860
our job is never really never finished

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,929
so no no matter how much we good we

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,210
actually become at doing our jobs the

99
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,090
other guy becomes better and if we stop

100
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,979
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at what we are we basically</font>

101
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,130
lose the battle right away so it's

102
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,110
really a race against time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put</font>

103
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,960
in a plug for win at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,820
whole presentation in terms of the

105
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,680
Middle East we can define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as the</font>

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,150
short Middle East or the white Middle

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,230
East you know there's countries like

108
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,900
saudi arabia oman qatar kuwait bahrain

109
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,670
etc UAE that are can call the core of

110
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle East being the GCC but</font>

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:09,420
there's obviously Egypt the MENA which

112
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,729
is Tunisia Morocco etc the migrant and

113
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,410
then of course now countries like Turkey

114
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,660
are part of the Middle East and to some

115
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,430
extent even Cyprus but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

116
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,830
countries that you do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,050
may consider part of the Middle East but

118
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have alliances and participate in</font>

119
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,970
Middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> East activities example will be</font>

120
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,740
Indonesia or Malaysia one has to

121
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand these alliances because they</font>

122
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,120
play an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part in these</font>

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,340
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other countries like</font>

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,380
for example Afghanistan Pakistan or even

125
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,429
India get involved in the Middle East

126
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,860
activities all the time the new world

127
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">order that is really taking it upon us</font>

128
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,290
is that we started primarily as a

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,350
defensive approach towards cyber warfare

130
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,530
where today we look much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an</font>

131
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,290
offensive capability and I think when we

132
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,479
start this offensive capability one has

133
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,580
to realize the implications of that and

134
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,920
I'll try to I like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

135
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,050
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> as i go about you can say</font>

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,390
today this primarily offensive

137
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,480
capability exists in countries like

138
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,729
United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States France China Russia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

139
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel in the Middle East but one</font>

140
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,350
would be surprised at countries which

141
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,070
much less resources have also developed

142
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:26,820
their own offensive capability so what

143
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,520
we have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an evolution of cyber</font>

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,070
war capabilities where we have at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,799
top of the food chain the United States

146
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,890
China and Russia not too far behind we

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,810
have certainly France UK in Israel<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

148
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,190
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries have evolved at a very</font>

149
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,830
fast pace

150
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,760
countries for example like India with a

151
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,789
lot of IT resources Turkey has played an

152
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,920
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part in certain Iran is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

153
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,230
almost you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> considered ranking</font>

154
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,730
number four in these capabilities but

155
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,730
other countries although<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are very</font>

156
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,730
quiet one should not misunderstand their

157
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,410
quietness for their capabilities or what

158
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,970
is actually happening under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the covers</font>

159
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">then includes countries like Saudi</font>

160
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,980
Arabia and United Arab Emirates so many

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these countries actually participate</font>

162
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,530
together some of have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels</font>

163
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:23,610
of capability but also what we call

164
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:26,669
national certs they also have kind of a

165
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Islamic or organisation of Islamic</font>

166
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,080
Cooperation sir what involves about 30

167
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,710
different countries that share common

168
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,390
interests the coordination of all these

169
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,330
certain activities actually takes place

170
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:42,330
in Oman so today there is actually three

171
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,890
primary circuits that have playing key

172
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,780
roles in the Middle East one is

173
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,219
certainly the Oman which is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font>

174
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,030
the country but also the islamic

175
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,790
cooperation sir there is certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> UAE</font>

176
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,440
and Qatar certs have invested

177
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,140
substantially and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more advanced</font>

178
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">capabilities other ones for example like</font>

179
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:06,570
Saudi Arabia Iran or for example turkey

180
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,000
or Egypt are more new<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

181
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,280
capabilities or other two countries like

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,440
Bahrain or Kuwait still have very

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,390
embryonic<font color="#CCCCCC"> suits you know they have not</font>

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,540
been fully deployed and do not yet

185
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,430
participate in very large or white

186
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,050
activities the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned here</font>

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,630
sir tis because search plays an

188
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,169
important aspect and taking the defense

189
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,780
capabilities as I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a new world</font>

190
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,909
order another important aspect is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

191
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,819
advancement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology as we use it</font>

192
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,459
today a few years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say main</font>

193
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,380
train species and by the way I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

194
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,830
on punch cards when I started in my

195
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:49,830
business so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say that today we</font>

196
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:52,480
have mobile devices you got to hold it

197
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,180
up to the light yeah

198
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,120
and being able to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> absa dick you're</font>

199
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,930
serious by the way asian my business

200
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,310
cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> very national security conference</font>

201
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,130
so the world today has evolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> into what</font>

202
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,930
we call mobile devices so today many of

203
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,350
us perform all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business</font>

204
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,660
activities on mobile devices I do teach

205
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,970
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five day course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile security and</font>

206
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,769
one realizes very well that mobile

207
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,320
devices are extremely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

208
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,420
entire lives are on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there emerged</font>

209
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,649
more complex and their capabilities in

210
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:31,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that they have gps Wi-Fi 3g 4g</font>

211
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:34,720
capabilities a location camera audio

212
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:38,529
capabilities so that gives the cyber war

213
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,920
a whole new insight in how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack our</font>

214
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,529
new infrastructure to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> matters worse</font>

215
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was presented by one of</font>

216
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,130
the early presenters yesterday was<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

217
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,110
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call the Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

218
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,750
decided to somehow put an IP on

219
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,290
everything from our running shoes to the

220
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:59,010
things that we carry our fridge and so

221
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">now our fridge can actually attack us</font>

222
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,639
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did not thought possible</font>

223
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,250
other thing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also certainly</font>

224
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,740
evolved is when we look at about

225
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,050
state-sponsored attacks is the amount of

226
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,779
resources that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are available so there is</font>

227
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,910
much better capability to actually turn

228
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,250
this internet of things as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

229
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack you are what we call now our</font>

230
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,639
critical infrastructure so for many

231
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,500
countries what is really their critical

232
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,680
infrastructure certainly their banking

233
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,709
sector their electrical grid their water

234
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,689
supply and certainly water more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil</font>

235
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:37,000
in many cases sometimes is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font>

236
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in the Middle East because it's</font>

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,910
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources that is in scarce</font>

238
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,750
availability on a transportation is

239
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,459
becoming more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more critical the</font>

240
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,459
interesting aspect about infrastructure

241
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,739
that we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage and is that no</font>

242
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter what amount of protection that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

243
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:01,360
put in place when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's firewalls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ids IPS</font>

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,100
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in and because they are</font>

246
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,719
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in we have to look at how we</font>

247
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">fed ourselves in a completely different</font>

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,480
way and i'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover that towards</font>

249
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:15,670
the end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation so you have</font>

250
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,800
to assume especially live in today's

251
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,229
world is that your systems are

252
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,959
compromised by default and then you have

253
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that is the way to actually</font>

254
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,180
defend yourselves so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

255
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">things unique about the Middle East and</font>

256
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,489
certainly what we can sometimes refer to

257
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:36,069
as cyber jihad there's a blurring lines

258
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,839
between ideology and the actual war with

259
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:42,310
sometimes called jihad which means

260
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:46,630
supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is for a just</font>

261
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,550
cause sometimes they hack for money and

262
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the purpose of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this money is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,389
fund their operations what that really

264
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,100
means is there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete circle that</font>

265
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,910
goes around between what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sometimes</font>

266
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">would call today financial crime now</font>

267
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,829
becomes part of a war crime because the

268
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,529
two are actually tied together so one is

269
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:08,469
to find a relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> between both</font>

270
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,509
there is a intention of simply

271
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,360
disruption critical infrastructure and

272
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:16,569
there's a few tools that get used for

273
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,000
that on time to time basis and there's a

274
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:22,569
race to develop their own generation of

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,250
cyber weapons these weapons can be used

276
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:28,420
for example for encryption for

277
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,310
extracting information from devices or

278
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,439
for simply recording<font color="#CCCCCC"> cramer or</font>

279
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,219
keystrokes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there has been a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

280
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:38,759
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tools that have been</font>

281
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,880
captured<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the years and actually I</font>

282
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,740
have been used for offensive purposes of

283
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,540
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lack of skill in many</font>

284
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,829
areas so the Middle East is spending a

285
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,339
lot of time and effort towards

286
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,589
developing experience training and

287
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:56,259
recruiting and of course online is being

288
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,170
used a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build alliances and these</font>

289
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,470
alliances are quite dynamic one of the

290
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that the Middle East is very</font>

291
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,600
capable is is that using social networks

292
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,939
for their own advantage so in that sense

293
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,019
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that this</font>

00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:37,089
weapon is simply just information as I

303
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned one of the important word</font>

304
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:43,120

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber crime so now there is a little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of connection between both in the</font>

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:51,010
sense that cybercrime is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

used to build large amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash and</font>

00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:04,209
then go and conduct cyber warfare so you

312
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,560
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware that in this new world</font>

worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operation olympic</font>

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,690
with it one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things for me it was</font>

325
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,060
surprising certainly for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. Israel</font>

326
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuel related countries was</font>

327
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,250
somehow the admission of in a public

328
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,100
scenario that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things actually</font>

329
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,680
existed one always assumed what we call

330
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,470
plausible deniability as the standard

331
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to talk about and the reason why I</font>

332
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,589
found this important is that when your

333
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,360
house is made out of glass the last

334
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:08,350
thing you want to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw a stone at</font>

335
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,170
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemy because the enemy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has much</font>

336
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,000
less to lose than nor country or an

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization such as the United States</font>

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,540
or Israel in some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of these</font>

339
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,279
attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> were launched without proper</font>

340
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,399
weapons in the sense that in the case of

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,589
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooler flame the code was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

are used against you in the future so

347
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,130
they are in reverse engineer the code

348
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,190
and then repurpose the weapons to<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch</font>

349
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:46,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say a reverse attack certainly</font>

350
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,170
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> statements that was made my</font>

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,060
brush<font color="#CCCCCC"> liar is they consider to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

352
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,000
extent Stuxnet a mistake or at least

353
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,000
certainly the admission of Stuxnet as

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,700
its existence so you can say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,930
key events of this century that caused

356
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,510
an escalation was a student I've done

357
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably many presentations over the</font>

358
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,200
last four or five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Stuxnet and</font>

359
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,449
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to spend a lot of time</font>

360
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,240
here on it but certainly the important

361
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,910
aspect is the sophistication of the

362
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of the attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes on in the</font>

363
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,930
sense that the world of IT and the world

364
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,350
of engineering came together to actually

365
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,719
destroy and cause weapon in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sense that</font>

366
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,440
in order to destroy the centrifuges the

367
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of research that was done</font>

368
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,060
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> items like resonance and</font>

369
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,829
resonance is nothing to do with the work

370
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,979
in you I do every day this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

371
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:43,010
of pure engineering to determine what is

372
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the frequency that you need to use to</font>

373
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,380
actually destroy a given object I mean

374
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,260
make a checker to the point that object

375
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,210
actually self-destructs so if you're

376
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested maybe after the presentation</font>

377
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can show you some of the videos of</font>

378
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,079
resonance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they can actually be</font>

379
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:04,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">used to create a substantial destructive</font>

380
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,020
impact as a subsequent to Stuxnet there

381
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">is other attacks that were also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused</font>

382
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:12,500
on the Middle East like flame one

383
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,470
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect about these two attacks</font>

384
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,690
certainly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that both of them were on</font>

385
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,940
for two to three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

386
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,010
actually discovered and this again

387
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,620
highlights the point that I want to

388
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,170
finalize later on is that the importance

389
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,600
of time in our capability of

390
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,100
self-defense so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes you two to</font>

391
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,469
three years to find out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

392
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,159
actually were attacked by that time is

393
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:41,270
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too late so type plays a very</font>

394
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,480
important aspect other attack was flame

395
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,450
which was used for espionage sabotage it

396
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,220
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large and highly modular</font>

397
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,620
interestingly enough here the code was

398
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">not properly encrypted so the same</font>

399
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,039
weapon could easily be repurposed for

400
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,110
attacking the original attacker as well

401
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">well you can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the infections</font>

402
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,990
that actually took place for Dooku flame

403
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ghosts spread quite well across the</font>

404
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire the Middle East one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

405
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,428
aspect about certainties attacks

406
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,830
compared to Stuxnet is that they were

407
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:17,750
much more quiet in how they approach the

408
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:21,139
attack in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they propagated</font>

409
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:25,850
very slowly to evade as much detection

410
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:30,428
as possible one of the notable attacks

411
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,428
certainly of last year certainly

412
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:39,159
late-2012 was the shamu attack that was

413
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:41,658
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> saudi aramco and RasGas this actually</font>

414
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,220
was you can call it a holiday gift

415
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:45,889
because this attack was actually

416
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,010
designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take place on the first day</font>

417
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:50,870
of hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> allah days so the day that saudi</font>

418
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,610
aramco<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees are actually scheduled</font>

419
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,870
to go on vacation this is action invaded

420
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,299
32,000 machines where it destroyed the

421
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,360
boot sector and made the information in

422
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:05,269
this machine's basically unusable the

423
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,070
down time in Saudi Aramco was mostly on

424
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrative systems although the</font>

425
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,899
impact was quite substantial wherein r

426
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,220
as guards actually the downtime involved

427
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:19,850
oil or gas production now the attack

428
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,460
could have been much worse in the sense

429
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,100
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> saudi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aramco of course the oil</font>

430
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,429
facilities are actually then not using a

<font color="#CCCCCC">windows system but using a unix system</font>

432
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,510
so they are completely isolated actually

433
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,820
sell your uncle is about seven different

434
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,580
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that use different</font>

435
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:42,408
technologies but this specific piece of

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">code only worked well in 32-bit systems</font>

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:50,450
not well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 bits so the actual virus</font>

450
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,980
you can imagine now the job of

451
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,640
recovering this environment you

452
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:29,540
literally have 32,000 art discs where

453
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,670
the information is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job for the next two or three years</font>

458
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,970
now what does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mean in the</font>

459
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,490
day-to-day<font color="#CCCCCC"> operations of Saudi Aramco</font>

460
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,080
let's assume I'm a Saudi Aramco doctor

461
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,030
because there is actually a hospital in

462
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,270
Saudi Aramco that means if you're a

463
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,460
patient and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to me i will</font>

464
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,040
go to you what was the reason why you

465
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,050
came visit me last time I don't remember

466
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the records to actually be</font>

469
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,640
we can certainly talk about towards the

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the presentation but it was</font>

471
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,590
substantially in terms of the operations

472
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,710
as the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as I mentioned</font>

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:22,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">before the oil production directly was</font>

475
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,020

476
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,030
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did say two weeks downtime</font>

477
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,100
for res gestae administrative as well

478
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,470
know though that was actually gas

production of really yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> RasGas were</font>

480
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,090
actually down in the production where

481
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,189
the systems in Saudi Aramco for oil are

482
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,830
actually isolated there is something

483
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">called expec and allspice when it's for</font>

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,490
exploration the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually to</font>

485
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,320
put the oil on the boats and those

486
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,560
systems are actually using unix based

487
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,820
systems this was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a windows-based</font>

488
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,800
attack so they would not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

489
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">capability to propagate into those</font>

490
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,659
systems you also said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that forensic work</font>

491
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,950
with exacerbated the problem did you

492
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:08,450
correct actually what happened is

493
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,400
there's a tech team for security company

494
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,980
that Sean<font color="#CCCCCC"> named nameless they arrived</font>

495
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
and they tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the thing but the</font>

496
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing was designed to actually met Matt</font>

497
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,880
is worse when you played with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so as</font>

498
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,440
they tried to fix it they actually the

499
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,780
blue screens to actually started to

500
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">appear much worse maybe London picked</font>

501
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,908
option contract the question about that

502
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,070
time some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who co-led by the UK</font>

503
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:34,309
diplomatically one of the biggest

504
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,309
worries was one of the main people in

505
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only time your flight if you</font>

506
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,530
would they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass the best</font>

507
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">people they had in the first instance</font>

508
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:48,799
which was surprising yes actually it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

509
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,280
I lights a very important aspect about

510
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident response you have to test your</font>

511
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,320
incidence response before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack not</font>

512
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,330
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack when you are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

513
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,500
test incidence response during an attack

514
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the best way to maybe</font>

515
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,880
describe it in simple terms is if you

516
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,590
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gym the first</font>

518
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:15,139
pick up that Bell it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt a</font>

519
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,299
little bit so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably describes</font>

520
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,220
it very closely there's more i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

521
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,860
describe but that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be left</font>

522
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to discuss during a coffee time the</font>

525
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,120
oh well there's a few global but

526
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-nine percent were actually saudi</font>

528
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,190
actually is a city actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aramco is</font>

529
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:42,770
like a country in the country to some

530
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:48,380
extent so it was inside the Aramco

531
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:50,299
facility bunkers got something like 50

532
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:56,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">or 75 thousand employees so it's a</font>

533
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:58,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly large organization there is</font>

534
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:01,100
distributed they even have employees in

535
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Texas here so they have quite a few</font>

536
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,570
organizations around the world but you

537
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,830
can say the boat the employees are in

538
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dhahran but of course there have</font>

539
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,928
exploration all the way around the

540
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,669
country is like so as they have people

541
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:19,669
on the ground throughout the entire

542
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:22,520
country now this type of attacks

543
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:25,149
obviously keeps going beyond just the

544
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shema just give us an example so</font>

545
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">palestinian others tend to attack Israel</font>

546
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,090
on

547
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,520
regular basis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they get attacked</font>

548
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,939
Israel also kind of response by

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,160
attacking back<font color="#E5E5E5"> shall be his Egyptians in</font>

550
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,590
Syrians now most of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks that</font>

551
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,530
to be of a denial-of-service nature or

552
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,090
just informational so no critical

553
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,290
infrastructure systems other than

554
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:53,389
banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to be disrupted one</font>

555
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,580
interesting aspect as I mentioned before

556
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,470
is the Middle East is slowly developing

557
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,810
their own capabilities of cyber weapons

558
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,230
and certainly maddie is one example of

559
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,510
that it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan that was designed and</font>

560
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,920
developed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle East and</font>

561
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,500
basically has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capability of attack</font>

562
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,110
record keystrokes turn on the audio on

563
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:16,160
your machines still text and image files

564
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:19,370
and you can quickly see by who was

565
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,350
mostly affected by this virus in this

566
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,989
case Israel to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy two percent to</font>

567
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:28,850
Lewis really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target audience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

568
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:32,420
this particular virus other important

569
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,520
aspects certainly is we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not</font>

570
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,850
always protect our infrastructure very

571
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,530
adequately and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> American</font>

572
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,750
certainly uses a lot of what we called

573
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:46,090
drone technology to conduct normal

574
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:48,560
warfare so in two particular cases a

575
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,620
predator<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaper and actually one of the</font>

576
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,260
drones was actually captured by Iran so

577
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,629
the first case keylogger virus was

578
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,690
actually affecting the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

579
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,910
drones on the second case they actually

580
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,030
were able to analyze and decompile the

contents of the drone itself the little

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:13,720
pink drawn you see there that was a gift

583
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:20,230
from Iran to President Obama<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I</font>

584
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:22,490
shall not not say more from time to time

585
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,250
the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure is</font>

586
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,410
critically important so here is an

587
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,570
example of a Middle East attack that

588
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,530
caused substantial amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruption</font>

589
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:35,000
on the US banks what important aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

590
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,030
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to highlight about certainly</font>

591
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,770
distributed denial-of-service attacks is

592
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,100
here we are as attacks that are being

593
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,840
conducted by countries

594
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,760
that have substantially less bandwidth

595
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,490
capability but however they use

596
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,190
creativity to actually still being able

597
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">to launch fairly attacks that cause</font>

598
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,390
major disruption the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best way to</font>

599
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,789
describe it for you is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're breathing</font>

600
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,850
through a straw but they can still make

601
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:04,960
you have a sweat at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in</font>

602
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,750
simple terms Iran continues to develop

603
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,549
their capability very sophisticated ways

604
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,799
here is a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the teams that</font>

605
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:16,820
launched the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of the attacks</font>

606
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,658
during July this is actually 2013 not

607
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:24,950
2014 because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

608
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:30,289
this is a Iran attack against specific

609
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:32,899
countries now one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I</font>

610
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to mention as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font>

611
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:36,139
to you early is the blurred lines

612
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,440
between the cyber world and the real

613
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:41,779
world kind of meet the road<font color="#CCCCCC"> or where the</font>

614
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,789
rubber hits the road in the Middle East

615
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,940
so they have developed you can say the

616
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:48,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">fourth largest cyber army today their</font>

617
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">objective is primarily to protect their</font>

618
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,360
critical infrastructure create isolated

619
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,840
networks for that infrastructure and

620
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,449
also develop attack capability but being

621
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,549
the head of a cyber army in Iran is also

622
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:09,889
a dangerous job so in this case this

623
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:11,480
person actually got killed as so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

624
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,219
where so for example I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of you if you're a head of a cyber army</font>

626
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,330
here you don't feel yourself being at

627
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,399
risk of being head of that cyber army

628
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,809
yes please go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the three slides</font>

629
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,979

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,590

632
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,779
individuals that happen to be supporting

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iranian interest or how would you</font>

634
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,070
categorize those groups it's actually a

635
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,389
combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> both there's a percentage</font>

of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually just</font>

637
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:44,510
volunteers but in the case of the

638
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,250
iranian cyber army they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the the</font>

639
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:49,010
actual army and then they have groups

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sponsor and they train and</font>

attacks against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey headed by a 19</font>

653
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,230

<font color="#E5E5E5">the names of this electronic army and</font>

655
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,140
basically the result was there were

656
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,110
themselves attacked as well so the

657
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:45,650
device website got taken down a few

times<font color="#CCCCCC"> per the ACA one would expect a</font>

country like Israel which has been in a

tough situation for many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,610
creating attacks that actually pass

668

under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radar there's certainly two</font>

669
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,929
recent attacks that should be

670
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:19,460
highlighted one is the attack against

671
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:21,950
the CCTV system controls the busy

672
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,160
highway so this highway had to be shut

673
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:27,320
down for<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hours because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

674
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,320
was not operational and the second one

675
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,679
is at the water processing plant I knife

676
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,330
as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned before water is one of</font>

outliers of all of this there is even

683

countries that one would not expect to

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:57,080
have cyber capabilities somehow still

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,920
stronger so please always be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

728
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,320
there's two sides to every coin other

729
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,809
important aspects there's ongoing

730
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,570
attacks and this little flowchart kind

731
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:03,629
of shows that you know it on attacks

732
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,540
Israel Israel attacks Iran Palestinian

733
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,580
attacks Israel Israel attacks Palestine

734
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,620
or Saudi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arabia and vice versa so</font>

735
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,020
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always an ongoing tit for tat of</font>

736
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,100
this small what we call cyber skirmishes

737
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,860
that happen minor<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS s defacements</font>

738
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,330
private disclosures so for example if

739
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're an important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy the chance to</font>

740
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your email or</font>

741
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,120
your private phone number gets disclosed

742
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:30,720
or things like attacks against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

743
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,969
financial sector to finalize the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end are</font>

744
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrapping up my presentation certainly</font>

745
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,340
one area that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the growth</font>

746
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,539
is these denial of service attacks and

747
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,639
what we have seen is that the kid

748
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:44,908
paucity of these attacks is growing in

749
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,620
the neighborhood of 60 to 100 gigabits

750
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:48,659
per second so this is the kind of

751
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,408
sustained attacks that you need to be

752
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:57,539
able to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself in an effective</font>

753
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:59,789
way one interesting aspect is who<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

754
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:02,669
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep our eyes on as we move forward</font>

755
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:05,908
and I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to make the parallel</font>

756
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:08,220
between the physical world and the cyber

757
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:11,159
world so today the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font>

758
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:13,199
certainly spends a lot in their military

759
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,240
spending and their cyber spending as

760
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,520
well but some other countries in the

761
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:21,029
Middle East that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should keep eye on</font>

762
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,129
for cyber weapons certainly is Israel in

763
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">the u.s. they already developed them but</font>

764
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:29,330
other countries such as Turkey Iran

765
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,099
Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates

766
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,049
Pakistan in India and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way one</font>

767
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting aspect about Pakistan if you</font>

768
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,070
still do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember although it's a</font>

769
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,629
poor country but they are very creative

770
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,700
people they're actually created the

771
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:44,159
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus if you remember the</font>

772
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:46,080
Pakistani virus not only that the

773
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,639
Pakistani virus actually contained the

774
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,980
phone numbers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individuals who</font>

775
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,440
created that virus and if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

776
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,969
door and you ring that for the guys are

777
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,780
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> still happy to receive you in</font>

778
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:59,189
their house and welcome you for coffee

779
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:03,390
the Middle East is definitely unique

780
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">placed working so 18 critical</font>

781
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,629
infrastructure sectors that are

782
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,880
highlighted by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. so when we look</font>

783
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,520
about protecting or defending in cyber

784
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,339
warfare world this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really where you</font>

785
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,369
need to defend yourselves banking water

786
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:19,140
supplies critical infrastructure such as

787
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,880
nuclear plants the Middle East is

788
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,640
building a lots of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

789
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,800
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the oil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually will run out</font>

790
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:30,089
protect your water supplies protecting

791
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,980
your bank financial sector etc so what

792
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:35,099
kind of message do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave with</font>

793
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,359
you as I finish my presentation one is

794
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,950
that in order for us to

795
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,749
find ourselves properly against this

796
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,788
type of attacks we have to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of think</font>

797
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:43,709
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the box so the</font>

798
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:46,440
traditional methods that we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

799
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">use are simply not effective or we</font>

800
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,789
always need to keep updating or what I

801
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:53,880
call our assumptions you always seem to

802
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:56,099
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit misplaced the other</font>

803
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,480
important aspect is that the attackers

804
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,569
if the Middle East are actually

805
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,119
extremely creative let me give you an

806
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:04,769
example we all know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA and</font>

807
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,499
their famous cyber espionage

808
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:10,200
capabilities but they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

809
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:12,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">country like Pakistan with very limited</font>

810
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,689
capabilities is actually capable of

811
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:17,700
bypassing this sophisticated technology

812
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,220
with a simple programmer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no</font>

813
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,769
more than a thousand dollars a month

814
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:24,169
they discovered a few years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

815
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:28,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">was because it wasn't the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's laptop</font>

816
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,900
that some of the attackers in Pakistan

817
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,059
had created a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of code that</font>

818
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,890
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> capable of when they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send a</font>

819
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">message they take a message that you</font>

820
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:40,259
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it splits this message into</font>

821
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:42,390
different chunks and actually sends this

822
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:44,039
message using different channels and

823
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">differently creeperish encryption</font>

824
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,450
mechanisms and different protocols and

825
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:50,220
different tools what that really means

826
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,799
is that if your organization like the

827
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,200
NSA and doing this massive data<font color="#E5E5E5"> globbing</font>

828
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,660
you will never be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to put all the</font>

829
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,549
pieces of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the puzzle together and so it</font>

830
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,519
means billions of dollars being invested

831
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:05,038
and one thousand dollars of<font color="#E5E5E5"> investing is</font>

832
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,049
capable to completely bypass this

833
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,150
approach this is what I call creativity

834
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:10,799
so that means if you want to defend

835
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,630
yourselves against this one thousand

836
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,940
dollar investment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to start</font>

837
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,420
thinking in a different way in order to

838
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be effective you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finalize as</font>

839
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,470
well our job is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about risk</font>

840
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,630
management so at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day we</font>

841
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,480
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited resources so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

842
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:30,329
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a proper risk assessment to</font>

843
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,220
actually you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know delegate our resources</font>

844
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:35,099
to where we have the greatest impact and

845
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,078
where we have the greatest exposure so

846
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:41,519
that we get the most bang for the buck

847
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,410
and to finalize I mentioned before the

848
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,019
most important resource that we do not

849
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,319
have and the cyber warfare world is time

850
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:50,189
and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked being a mathematician</font>

851
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,340
by a

852
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,280
I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked this equation even today</font>

853
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,930
p must be greater than D plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> R which</font>

854
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,420
means the level of protection that you

855
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have or the tools that you dedicate to</font>

856
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,610
protection should be greater or buy you

857
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,590
more time than detection and response in

858
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cyber war world of today you have to</font>

859
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:13,380
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have zero-day attacks so</font>

860
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,000
that means protection equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero that</font>

861
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> means the things that you need to</font>

862
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,830
focus on is detection and response that

863
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,090
means if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes you two to three years</font>

864
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,819
to figure out that you're being attacked

865
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,310
like in the case of Stoops map Dooku

866
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,440
flame etc that means they come they go

867
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,170
it's too late the case of shallow

868
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,090
response was extremely important so you

869
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to try your incident response</font>

870
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,290
scenarios much way ahead of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

871
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,080
order to be effective in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your approach</font>

872
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,480
to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself so if you want to be</font>

873
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,930
in this business the most important

874
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,700

875
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,649
probably my famous moto I'm a bomb

technician if you see me running try to

877
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:58,610
keep up well yes please there are some

878
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,280
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so base all you just said</font>

879
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the current response or defensive</font>

880
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Erica speak up Liz would you advocate</font>

881
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,359
that an active cyber posture for

882
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">defensive purposes or even a pre-emptive</font>

883
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,690
10 well I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not go to so much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so far</font>

884
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,850
as the preemptive one today but

885
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,400
certainly you have to go beyond

886
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,040
defensive capabilities to be effective

887
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,430
today but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more important</font>

888
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that the traditional ways of</font>

889
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:31,710
collecting cyber intelligence are we

890
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,900
think they're effective but in reality

891
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are not for the most creative</font>

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">people next question please I did</font>

893
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,090
mention a thorough the contract

894
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,500

895

proliferating in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Gulf acting</font>

896

as guys you're providing I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the other names but there's several</font>

898
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:59,010
several organizations mostly out of

899
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,230
Europe that are providing capabilities

900
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,809
to send the regime's there and we looked

901
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,849
at

902
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:09,309
uh yes but as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

903
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:13,089
presentation on everything can be

00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:15,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed uh yeah I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess my</font>

905
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:16,859
question is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you</font>

906
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:20,469
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that or are</font>

00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:21,848
proliferating through of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course that</font>

908
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:26,319
will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> because at the end of the</font>

909
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:29,819
day is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call cyber for hire so</font>

910
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,189
there's going to be a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

911
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:35,019
mercenary kind of approach towards so

912
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:36,549
the mercenaries of the real world I've

913
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:40,808
simply moved into the cyber world

914
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:43,288
nothing more nothing less I can you

915
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:46,239
address a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the NGOs</font>

916
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:48,670
the really bad guys whether it's the

917
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,739
hiding the attacking the association is

918
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,400
the most of this was focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what I'm</font>

919
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:57,699
gathering to be nation state oriented

920
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,769
see the NGOs what happens most of the

921
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:01,599
local countries see them sometimes it's

922
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:05,019
a Trojan<font color="#CCCCCC"> horse so they do not</font>

923
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:08,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily trust NGOs at all and they</font>

924
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:10,359
try to either isolate them or keep them

925
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:13,328
as much far away from mainstream as

926
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:15,339
possible because they seemed the sea

927
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">NGOs primarily as an instrument</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

928
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:21,609
foreign powers I think one of the really

929
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:23,979
symmetry is there in the interview oh

930
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:27,670
yeah might be frigid different ideas a

931
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:30,089
lot of the potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> targets of these</font>

932
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,529
organizations if you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments</font>

933
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:34,479
more major corporations like a ram codes

934
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:36,519
that are highly dependent upon their IT

935
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:38,468
infrastructure for their proper

936
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,049
functionality and yet some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

937
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:43,170
attackers are not rather they tend to

938
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:46,029
live in either individual or small cells

939
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,339
the computing systems are basically

940
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:50,709
weaponized rather than used for command

941
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,328
and control and operating their own

942
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,828
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

943
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:56,170
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a profit Center to go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

944
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,640
maintain if you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 bucks a</font>

945
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,769
month you can go ahead and develop

946
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,509
offensive capabilities or even defensive

947
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:04,299
capabilities you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do much</font>

948
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:07,569
so your attack surface as the attacker

949
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:09,459
is virtually zero other than the meat

950
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,739
space attack surface where you go ahead

951
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:13,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they have to put pop around into the</font>

952
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,829
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> of somebody or other and now all of</font>

953
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,550
a sudden the only way to stop the cyber

954
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:18,190
attack is to

955
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the humans that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that is correct so</font>

956
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,910
that there is this merge of the fibrin

957
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,070
cyber and physical world but the other

958
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,430
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important is that we have</font>

959
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:28,930
Goliath and the small able<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy with a</font>

960
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,060
slingshot that the guy with the

961
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:34,000
slingshot can be almost as effective as

962
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,009
the Goliath guy and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber world</font>

963
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,900
certainly proves that and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

964
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different than the way it</font>

965
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,670
happens in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real cyber world when a</font>

966
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,350
small organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> by promoting their</font>

967
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,230
products to Google can effectively

968
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:50,620
compete with a much larger organization

969
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:52,540
that has a much deeper pockets so you

970
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,029
can say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cyber world kind of</font>

971
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,070
levels the playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> field a little bit so</font>

972
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,260
you have to go back to square one to

973
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually be more effective so project</font>

974
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,060
this out five or ten years<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you see a</font>

975
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,549
GCC specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

976
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,860
excluding others or ucf organization or

977
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,870
is it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be well that is already</font>

978
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,630
work in progress actually Saudi Arabia

979
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:15,160
as the intent of unifying the GCC not

980
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,830
just the cyber armies but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

981
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,990
armies as well but it see the problem

982
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:24,040
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GCC is that the dynamics of the</font>

983
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:25,930
GCC change on a day-by-day basis example

984
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,850
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last discussions oh man does</font>

985
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,270
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to participate and that</font>

00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">alliance a hundred percent yet so it's</font>

987
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:35,860
it's kind of a tough way for one simple

988
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,560
example the GCC has been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unify</font>

989
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,560
their monetary union now for almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

990
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 years and still they have not still</font>

991
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:48,340
ongoing discussion so you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

992
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,350
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take a lot more negotiations for</font>

993
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,440
for this to actually take place so it

994
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:57,660
will happen maybe by forceful means or

995
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,660
the ongoing negotiations<font color="#CCCCCC"> will continue</font>
