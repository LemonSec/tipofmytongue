the frameworks that's out there

60
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,640
wikipedia has also got a great freaking

61
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,010
article on it is the Carver methodology

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,929
Carver + chaos because you have the

63
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,329
accumulative effect of Carver afterwards

64
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,980
I don't have slides on that but if

65
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:35,500
you're not familiar i strongly recommend

66
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,420
looking into it the entire talk is

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,760
considerably longer than an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the highlights best of the cheap</font>

69

shit that you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,950
destructive damage with electricity and

because of that water health and<font color="#CCCCCC"> safety</font>

72
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,238
and Trust of the same emergency services

on all the devices in all of our pockets

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:11,080
and tablets and the rest of it no I lose

78
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:14,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again area cars the first one up so</font>

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,600
the and of course converting my flight

80
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,029
is always fun um their grid you have

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,940
generation all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack all the plants</font>

82
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,590
that are pumping high high high voltage

83
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,940
you have transmission lines to

84
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,400
distribute it to where it needs to go

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have district</font>

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,198
mission which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the considerably less</font>

87
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,290
voltage going out to your homes and

88
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,259
everything else the big point is the

89
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,090
gigantic weak link is in between

90
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:46,509
generation and transmission from what I

91
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:49,299
found this is a phase attenuating

92
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,580
voltage regulator or voltage regulation

93
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,680

pervert or poverty but Herbert works

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,710
turning that into this this is a photo

97
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,859
from action mechanical default or defect

98
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,159
that caused this gigantic failure this

99
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,860
was in Asia I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> knocked out power</font>

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,570
for I guess the equivalent of a state

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,810
aside the physical size of a state that

102
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here in the US for two to three</font>

103
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,039
weeks I believe it's a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> for scale</font>

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,039
for size you can see there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-foot</font>

105
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,419
something man you know the size of a

106
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,479
small house a gigantic oil tank on top

107

firewall is now yeah they're not they're

109
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,669
not a deterrent for attack it's just in

110
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event of damage or burning for once</font>

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,070
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from these are smaller perverts</font>

122
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,430
these things especially if your point

132
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,659
I'll get into that in a second I guess

133
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,068
there's also from the perverts their

134
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,280
circuit breakers so in the event of

135
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:01,060
failure these will fire that's an older

136
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,489
design it's driven by<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil I rather be</font>

insulator is oil there's a modern design

138
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,440
these here it's getting the exact same

139
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,449
job accomplished a much smaller amount

146
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,969
environment they would explode this

147
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,878
thing would shoot up you know 50 feet in

148
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:42,430
the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'd be massive damage the</font>

149
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,979
problem being is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's just a tiny</font>

150
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,199
little thin piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of metal protecting</font>

151
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,469
that inert gas storage same as you have

152
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,610
mild tempered steel<font color="#CCCCCC"> or mild steel</font>

153
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,949
protecting the oil reservoir for the

154
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:01,870
circuit breakers so if those were to be

155
00:07:53,949 --> 00:08:03,759
damaged by your typical terrorist you

156
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,759
can take out a staged over here so

157
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,639
that's a yeah that's a 22 I I would

158
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,710
assume for the at the range we're

159
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,729
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe at 22 250 but a small</font>

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,099
them out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I won't get into</font>

162
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:23,979
silencer design but those are a lot more

163
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:27,750
easily damaged from a moderate distance

164
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:30,460
than the older style circuit breaker Oh

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">miners in West Virginia some years ago</font>

166
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,890
do this for real it shot transformers

167
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,599
with their rifles listened they could

168
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">just explode and they were in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups of</font>

four and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could take on all four of</font>

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,729
us we've actually a real world

171

192
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:48,040
need to penetrate one of those one of

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:51,339
those oil tanks same thing with the I'm

194
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,890
going to roll back here because I wanted

195
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have you done any chiding no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> special</font>

any Chinese no special courses or try to

198
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:06,160
shoot yeah well um let's cover that

199
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:10,450
right now yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to throw in</font>

200
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:16,240
an extra slide and I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will but on</font>

201
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:19,420
the on the poverty these are ya pervert

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,660
yes on the pervert your typical perverts

203
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:26,170
you can tell by his<font color="#E5E5E5"> mustache um you have</font>

204
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,839
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gigantic oil reservoir and on the</font>

205
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,120
right behind these fans let's all

206
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,590
galvanized steel for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of it</font>

207
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,070
are a series of radiators so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

208
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:41,620
if there's a ton of photos online if you

209
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,630
look for this this style design they all

210
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,850
look very similar sometimes the oil tank

211
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,260
is off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side in most cases it's</font>

212
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,570
about because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're letting gravity do</font>

213
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,730
the work for them you could puncture a

214
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,140
hole at the bottom of the base<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

215
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:58,830
oil reservoir one of the top so it

216
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,630
evacuates the oil more quickly and

217
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,830
punching a hole right near the bottom of

218
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,710
the radiator you can shoot through the

219
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,720
fan it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

220
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,390
it is just galvanized there's no

221
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,930
additional hardening around this this is

222
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,610
in much more of a secure location

223
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you're going to have to</font>

224
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,240
basically be on I believe this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

225
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,370
photo with the road there's a interstate

226
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,290
or a highway so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

227
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,480
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it from a lunch considerably</font>

228
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,150
longer distance the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

229
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,480
are in isolated places they're not near

230
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,510
a major city they're near much

231
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,030
considerably closer to power generation

232
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:42,050
when I first was looking at this as an

233
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,540
analysis point I focused more on the

234
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,219
Pacific Northwest<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are off in</font>

235
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,949
woodland areas there's not a lot of

236
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">people there's a minimum crew of four or</font>

237
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,780
five constantly on staff these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

238
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:57,620
buildings are manned power generation

239
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">24-7 in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it blows up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but all you</font>

240
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,240
would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fluid</font>

241
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,250
necessary to cool these devices they

242
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,590
will overheat and you know it explode

243
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,930
the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the size you</font>

244
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,850
can see by that that scale photo it's

245
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,390
the size of a small house and it weighs

246
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,880
a considerable amount of it they are

247
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:23,270
very very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop in a</font>

248
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">replacement and in most specifically in</font>

249
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,970
the Pacific Northwest there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

250
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:33,079
many replacements on hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> like where</font>

251
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,700
they made yes yes there's actually

252
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,530
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese sites we even</font>

253
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">buy a considerably smaller one if you</font>

254
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,630
wanted to set up like a mini power grid

255
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:45,020
fewer<font color="#E5E5E5"> test range yeah or a exactly if</font>

256
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:48,800
you wanted to do some testing it so you

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,240
take out one they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need if</font>

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,050
they were working around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clock and</font>

259
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,120
had all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the equipment on hand two days</font>

260
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,400
to replace and then they have no

264
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:10,280
it is the a gigantic<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sorry I get I</font>

266
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:16,699
poorly we secure our infrastructure

267
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:23,089
that's physical attack it

268
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:26,420
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zoey any power infrastructure</font>

269
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:30,050
they're all we use these here the older

270
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:33,880
circuit design is much more prevalent in

271
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,800
in other countries not<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America</font>

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,410
because of the cheapness of the design

273
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,550
these modern ones have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced</font>

274
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,850
because they're a lot cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

275
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,770
manufacture and bacon well there we're

276
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking what a 30-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replacement life</font>

281
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,840
yeah the power administration's up there

282
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,230
for in that case there is a single

283

fee Pacific Northwest grid in northern

washington so they have one and a backup

286
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,260
so you take out one wait for them to

287

replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backup take that out in</font>

292
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,970
going to look up one that's a very good

293
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,280
point Jake what one or two manufacture

294
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,010
these worldwide that again I don't know

295
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,480
tell you I the exact are the designs

296
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:47,030
themselves regulated by government now I

297
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,770
believe it's all private industry now

298
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,770
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> there some very basic stamps</font>

299
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,270
going into these there's not there's not

300
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,670
a lot to them in a general sense

301
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,040
everybody every manufacturer has their

302
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,500
own secret sauce right but they all

303
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,410
function on the same basic principle

304
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,740
right is I know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font>

305
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,120
this probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the hardening or the</font>

306
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,670
controls that you would see needing to

307
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,800
be put in place there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

308
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,560
agency that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually enforce those</font>

309
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,089
putting in being put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place is that</font>

310
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,760
what are you sure it won't come on the

378
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,750
to focus on a small small group 4 or 5

379

impactful acts of terrorism definitely

381
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,370
don't go where they all have guns yeah

<font color="#E5E5E5">about so responsiveness when that when</font>

398
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,889
that goes down there is a twenty-five

399
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,300
twenty-five percent based on publicly

400
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,350
available information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been able to</font>

401
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">find comes from coal power from Montana</font>

402
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:28,129
colorado area so the inner tie is just a

403
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,010
gauge dependent that will determine the

404
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,260
load on each side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the theater tie and</font>

405
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,180
if it's dropping it's going to increase

406
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,940
the load that's coming from the other

407
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,610
energy supplier there are some key

408
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,070
junctures that if you time arrival

409
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,469
cascade pretty significant inside most

410
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,350
of these larger stations

411
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,960
there is a the inner tie box where that

412
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">gauge exists and you can watch it it's</font>

413
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,659
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much 5050 but you can see you can</font>

414
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,140
see my new fluctuations in it it's a

415
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:02,690
usually there's no big manufacturer of

416
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner tie device there is but the</font>

417
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,659
box for regulation and tying in with the

418
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:10,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing network is all hand tailored</font>

419
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:12,740
most of which that I've seen it's just a

420
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:15,710
gigantic silver box at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> or bottom</font>

421
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,470
of Iraq and<font color="#E5E5E5"> has one button on it that</font>

422
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,720
says enter tie off or inter<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie power</font>

423
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,380
off so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to compromise the</font>

424
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,150
security the building find the box and

425
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,520
physically push the button it's a single

426
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,710
button to destroy the inner tie so if

427
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,570
the inner thighs down powers<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

428
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,760
there's no way to get the power back on

429
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,480
without a cold start many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I think</font>

430
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,890
there'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no edit that be nothing well</font>

431
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,679
I got a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different solutions for</font>

432
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:46,309
no internet face all of your texts

433
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:48,320
revolve in these two shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm so in</font>

434
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,629
terms of reaction or network and

435
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,059
real-time reporting you've just defined

436
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,490
a requirement therefore they need some

437
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:59,059
odds with myself for the show oh that's

438
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,030
why I I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find as many photos of</font>

439
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,850
non scary black rifles so so i'm using

440
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,570
late eighteen hundreds rifles with a

441
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,399
cheap a scan on the suppressor<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

442
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,980
that way that way you're hearing much

443
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,080
less report if any with a with a 22 to

444
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,330
take out the modern circuit breakers all

445
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,789
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear is the impact on</font>

that weeks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks dealer oral is</font>

other thing in your reconnaissance phase

457
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,880
what you're going to do is you're

458
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,729
introduced curious noise at the same

459
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,260

00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:25,879
which gets speak actually to my digital

please break takers nobody's come out

478
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:49,339
and it takes for ya circles really I

479
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:53,359
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about this afterwards</font>

that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right before I get redacted</font>

481
00:22:53,359 --> 00:23:01,968
yeah I'm sure black bags in April last

there they were not vulnerable but the

494
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,729
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a second it took three</font>

reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the ICS sir it took them</font>

502
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,129
about it I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a series of vendors</font>

503
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:08,899
have released patches to their their

506
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,990
and this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Goblet I believe yes</font>

507
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry terms of testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did they like</font>

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement d mp3 with their application</font>

511
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,910
well it was it was an issue that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

512
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's specific as most most of these</font>

513
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,240
ip-based vulnerabilities it's also can

514
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:46,410
be accomplished locally so if you have

515
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,360
cereal access or dial up IP access to

516
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,710
these devices or the sensor net that

517
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've been compromised it the same way</font>

518
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,580
with the compromise to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gauntlet</font>

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,000
server causing it to become unresponsive

520
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,300
until a physical power cycle it has to

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,830
reinitialize the the stack<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe not</font>

522
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sensor stack but also network stack</font>

523
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:10,199
yes there's also a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other ways</font>

524
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,330
to compromise users response to the

525
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,750
sensor feedback that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting for</font>

526
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">n i guess i should point out these</font>

527
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:22,620
sensors are placed on these critical

528
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:24,420
assets so the the inner tie or the

529
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,800
variety of hundred plus different

530
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,800
sensors that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always in a power</font>

station reporting up the dial gateway

532
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,840
and then a server so a user that's out

533
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,580
in the field or someone in headquarters

534
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:49,080
can see on the big board current state

535
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power network now typically they</font>

541
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,040
its panic and it's always absolutely

542
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:11,790
have a pre free implementation of these

543
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:13,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems so I peace covered by newark all</font>

everything that's still on cereal and

547
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,480
dial-up or IP afterwards but serial

548
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:30,260
connectivity is not

549
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,660
Adlai I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> why but I know that</font>

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of power companies have gone back</font>

no longer have to comply with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nerks</font>

554
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so we have people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are rolling</font>

vulnerable to attack as opposed to

getting with the program obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

558
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:57,350
is a big driver<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that a lot of</font>

through an elaborate series of

federal programs there's an exception

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,740
a new corporate world before you get

wanted more<font color="#CCCCCC"> wnd craziness is this a</font>

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,880
global system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean is this ensuite no</font>

567
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,689
this is it this is per site I mean you

568
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,679
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement this I'm seeing the dnp3</font>

569
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:27,400
yeah the protocol is vulnerable but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:31,280
know they're used all around the world

he set the deceivers seems cool siemens

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,059
not it's standardized but it's not

their own special sauce for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

576
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:47,150
otherwise lean forward a little bit so

577
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,510
i'll tell you about anyway so just the

578
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:53,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">board said we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got the ability to for</font>

579
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,169
example on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> woman well head high 60 low</font>

580

581
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:03,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be four monthly mullet is a</font>

582
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,049
flow so I'm the question becomes when

583
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,850
you control the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go all</font>

584
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:10,370
the way down as far as a way that's

585
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:13,100
about as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you go when in control</font>

586
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,189
system becomes compromised you call

587
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing so these are trick for some of</font>

588
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,350
them now we're as big to come the

589
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:25,460
operators that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their valves and things</font>

590
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:28,370

winds now serve my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine right others</font>

619
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,919
there's an entire talk there that could

620
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,070
just be done around sensors and attacks

621
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,990
or or hardening hardening thoughts on

network to step back I'll introduce you

624
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,030
to dr. oz who use the chief scientific

626
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,670
know and I think we can add some extreme

627
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,850
value and you can also act as a clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

628
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:07,640
face to the IT security community

629
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,730
because what you'll find is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> divers I</font>

630
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,760
know he install the diesels a tricky one

631
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,010
of the Japanese nuclear but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

632
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes back out there before they were fun</font>

633
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,740
but he's a guy that I've seen to it

634
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,620
installed covering diesel head to toe 3x

table petty officer does ships<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diesel's</font>

636
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,750
anything and he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about the</font>

637
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,240
IT systems he just wants this thing to

638
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:35,390
work and the scalar challenge is the

639
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,920
ways of thinking these guys will put

640
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,440
stuff in the ground and you said 50

641
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,920
years I've met British Rail<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said 25</font>

642
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,410
years they do not care about the IT side

643
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,960
until I agree though and it's chalk and

644
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:51,470
cheese and this is the cultural barrier

645
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,700
that we have to learn to bridge as I

646
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,920
you know what you can tighten<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight</font>

647
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,460
that language yeah we have systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

648
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,290
are being implemented on 50 60<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus year</font>

specific intent take a look and keep on

651
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,290
tickin against you know bombs and all

652
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,300
sorts of attack that are then being

653
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,740
adapted to at least function from a

654
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,629
reporting or management standpoint

655
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,970
mostly reporting in some cases

656
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,940
management overall reporting and

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,560
alerting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess some of these position</font>

658
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,960
a little bit better has ended back in

659
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,690
the mid-90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I work for one of those</font>

662
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,980

<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> release the right way to fiber</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can string all the fiber you want</font>

00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,920
them so that when they connect they show

you would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you can see</font>

00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,149
have remote people running around with

where there they might be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

700
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,649
work and the trucks just there steal a

have insecurities with ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

go down to to a hundred mil wat but the

827
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,730
price range for half a lot of to a

828

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:29,000

00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:39,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">also tell you station identification</font>

834
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:41,900
information if your browser that's

835
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:42,520
that's what RDS is those modules are

836
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,080
about 60

837
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,840
so if the emergency alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> system kicks</font>

838
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,480
off you can also implement the text

841
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:59,750
is occurring and according from the FCC

842
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,370
between a hundred and thousand watts

843
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,900
you're talking to coverage of a service

844
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,440
area between three and a half to a

845
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,380
little under nine miles that's pretty

846
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,860
effective area especially if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> push</font>

847
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yeah they this same manufacturer</font>

848
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,350
that makes these also<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a adapter</font>

849
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,970
board that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a much lower power</font>

850
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:23,660
output because it does all the work for

851
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:26,779
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like 500 watt 600</font>

852
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:30,620
watt and it's about about six hundred

853
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:37,190
dollars yeah yeah and and all these have

854
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:39,549
standard audio 3.5 million whatever you

855

yeah 90 degrees or there's a heat wave

trigger off the alarms that are you know

867
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:21,560
before I get into noise generators with

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:42,020
come to mind in the last two months you

876
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,660
could scan for instance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same attack that you would hear</font>

absolutely taking this and say you

903
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,029
upload code so now you have remote

command command and injection capability

905
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,420
for all the modern news sites that

909
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,410
your basic absolutely well and not to

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:18,400
mention monitoring capability for v6 is

911
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:18,399
limited at best let's let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

912
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">hmm well there's that there's a variety</font>

913
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,470
of there's a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of home routers</font>

914
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,780
that you can purchase and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then sell</font>

915
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:35,480
it'll spin up an additional access point

916
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:38,000
for free that's throttled and you can

917
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,820
inject ads to get revenue for yourself

918
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,460
based on that doing the exact same thing

919
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:51,610
except obviously packing in as much fun

920
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:51,610
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can yeah yeah or channels yes</font>

921
00:43:52,240 --> 00:44:02,000
give to give a variety of creative

922
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:04,610
writers access to it and they could they

923
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,800
could come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their new stories</font>

924
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,470
each weekend actually if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font>

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,750
wanted to go deep on that

926
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,790
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> alter the stories that are being</font>

929
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,750
shocking that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> would believe at</font>

there's a I could do a series of talks

00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,270
and I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even the best</font>

about 70 for 75,000 hosts worldwide that

00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:11,439
basically full spectrum for

communication for a civilian

1015
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,460
implementation of obviously there's of

1016
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,710
course military applications that are

1017
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,259
outside of these bands and high and

1018
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,609
super low and the rest of it you if you

1019
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:24,579
were going to go choose a specific

1020
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:26,828
target that's outside of so regular band

1021
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:32,400
this is more of a stone this is more of

switched out what's legality of these

1095
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,109
things um from what I found from the

1096
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:52,140
FCC's documentation and their public

1097
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:55,170
statements are always much more broad

1098
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> vague than the actual written law</font>

1099
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">from what I've seen and currently</font>

1100
00:51:57,299 --> 00:52:02,130
understand possession is not against the

potentially hypothetically speaking be

1103
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:09,328
activated then there's violation of our

1104
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:12,299
goals civil or ground I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1105
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:14,279
criminal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC typically does civil law</font>

1106
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:16,140
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's like with what state</font>

1109
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:22,288
why if everyone in in my effective range

1110
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,930
consents I believe it still violates

1111
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:26,819
federal law because it can interfere one

1112
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:30,509
of the stipulations is the interferes

1113
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:33,359
with emergency like 911 an availability

it's a federal water where it doesn't

1127
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:16,280
lead to make sense yeah in Washington we

1128
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,590
were for a long period of time able to

1129
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,440
own suppressors but not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fix</font>

1130
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:24,230
and use them with our weapons that also

1131
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,550
applied to law enforcement you could own

1132
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,730
a suppressor in the state of Washington

1133
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:30,380
up until two years ago three years ago

1134
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:32,090
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could not you you could not do</font>

1135
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,530
so i'll apply our weapon with one attack

1136
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:37,010
and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you regularly</font>

1177
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,210
and if I'm a bad guy that's a nice tool

1178
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,790
one wait if you'll realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1179
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:41,180
thinking though you would need a lot of

00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:42,770
GPS antennas primarily or direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1181
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:46,578
so you would need a lot of power to

<font color="#E5E5E5">overcome an aircraft pdps in my bag is</font>

yeah okay when you buy a pot would you

1189
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:06,490
exactly how know unidirectional they let

1190
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:09,020
you I'm freely travel on airplanes

1191
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:11,779
domestic flights all the time with this

1192
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:13,509
and even smaller devices you could set

1193
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:16,099
up one on a timer with a microcontroller

1194
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:18,290
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often do flight attendants check</font>

the next the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next leg of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that question</font>

1199
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,049
yeah yeah yeah actually I was a lien on

1200
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:32,780
the aircraft you could probably screw

1201
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,670
with it that's all that is a better that

1202
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:38,869
I'm you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not willing to see me so I</font>

1203
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:43,040
don't want to be on the plane we did

<font color="#CCCCCC">this we do okay most stick that I'm</font>

1206
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:50,210
like your system well it's actually

1207
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:53,319
jumping power directly to the same ships

1208
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:56,680
that we all have in our cell phones yeah

1209

on you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about three hops</font>

standard because a lot of fun

1213
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:12,290
manufacturers use those all company and

1214
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:17,029
this me yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I aww yeah I should have</font>

1215
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:19,950
taken a photo with a with us so but that

1216
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:22,230
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh port on the back is RS 232</font>

1217
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:25,410
so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> skit and those two connectors are</font>

1218
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:27,780
our I believe nan<font color="#CCCCCC"> over so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1219
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:32,970
ability as a mechanized so we're talking

00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the device that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say no more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1221
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:41,609
I don't advise the kids but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> size we</font>

1222
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:44,760
get one about the size you can place you

1223
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:46,440
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the origin and missing if you</font>

1224
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,540
want to have a scaled-down version of

1225
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,390
these these they have power amps that

1226
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:54,480
have a lot smaller end to the output but

1227
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:58,920
25 watt would be more than enough I just

1228
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,599
want the point yeah you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

1229
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,849
you could do a board design well that's

1230
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:09,300
easily flushable why this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> scares</font>

1231
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:12,480
me that's the so with with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1232
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:17,730
an effective range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wealth potential</font>

1233
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,800
effective range of 300 to 500 feet I

1234
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:24,240
have a potential effective range of 300

1235
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:29,760
to 500 feet for this if one looks so

1236
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:32,270
inclined dip or or just put a magnet on

1237
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,380
the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stick it on a metal roof or</font>

1238
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,000
there's a bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1239
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,950
you can this is a watertight seal

1240
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,579
container you can put it wherever you

1241
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:44,430
want we'll work from underwater RF noise

1242
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:46,530
you know yeah it's how that matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1243
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,629
for the ELO really underwater without

00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:50,369
without my modifications the standard

1245
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,650
battery pack that comes in that mob day

1246
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:54,660
and he'll know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a battery life of</font>

1247
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,760
about two hours two to three hours

01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:31,810
from one location as you're driving away

1282
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:36,700
it's that cigarette thrown out of the

1285
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a bunch of wireless devices then</font>

1286
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:45,879
the wireless RF to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serial bridges that</font>

01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,680
are used for Barry so what's actually do

1288
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,610
want anybody know here that's causing

1289
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,160
the issue i guess so so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yes so</font>

1290
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:56,860
you have one plugged into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amp and</font>

1291
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,420
you send the go whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't</font>

1294
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,410
you're using it from gauger center place

1295

1296
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,560
Oh controlling through this I mean I

1297
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,470
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're 32 is much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore I'm sorry it sure is you would</font>

1299
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:16,149
yeah you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be surprised it's</font>

1300
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere still everywhere because it's</font>

1301
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:21,370
cheap you could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

1302

1303
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:29,470
dollars now this is not this is not for

1304
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:32,650
the most part 12 volt it's 120 volt but

1305
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:35,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's fits in a briefcase that's with the</font>

1306
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:36,850
omni antenna it's a week antenna you

1307
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,310
could probably get a much better

1308
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:41,860
coverage with a larger antenna panel

1309
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:43,840
pack so get a deep stack briefcase

1310
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:46,090
you're talking maybe six hundred dollars

1311
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,080
but versus the price<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

1312
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:52,900
500<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the same equivalent power output</font>

1313
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:55,330
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more cost effective I also</font>

1314
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,030
do like the fact that this photo

1315
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:59,980
includes the DC to AC adapter so you can

1316
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:04,300
plug it into a vehicle have a briefcase

this is for a poor man's thing it

regulated good question i remember back

1399
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,630
in the tempest days a year old enough

1400
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:30,950
never that tempest was illegal and all

1401
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:34,760
that hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all the stuff that we</font>

1402
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:38,089
did it anyway whatever and there was

1403
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,980
some companies up and around DC area at

1404
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:41,720
specialize in selling tempest equipment

1405
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:44,660
so i did a look-see lot as consulting to

1406
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,759
hughes and they were selling like 30,000

find it so shit that's a whole mess of

1457
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:53,250
new equipment with some new expertise

1458
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:55,490
and then nobody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean how many p.m.</font>

1467
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:18,719
after the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can show you some</font>

1468
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,460
sample data from a live capture for the

1469
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,649
2.4 get your spectrum what it looks like

current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and what it looks like</font>

1471
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:24,979
after one of these no generators been

<font color="#E5E5E5">activated</font>

1473
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:34,189
and that data was discovered not

1474
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:36,710
translate the data by captured squad

1475
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:38,929
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> record yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah banana</font>

1476
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:41,120
died capture /<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks at in a country</font>

1477
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,069
without extradition 32 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. that</font>

1478
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:47,358
allows testing of wireless equipment

1479
01:08:43,069 --> 01:08:49,759
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> call him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a small low power</font>

1480
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,670
test captured Tampa Bay and compared the

1481
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:56,410
tooth I can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if it I can show</font>

1482
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to add through the effort block</font>

1483
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:03,589
yeah so one the one point that I wanted

1484
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:06,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover with this is that there are so</font>

1485
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:08,930
many widespread applications for cheap

1486
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,940
ass off-the-shelf hardware and we could

1487
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:13,370
go into so many two other different

1488
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:15,620
fields<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attack and terrible ideas I</font>

1489
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:17,630
have for them there's no unifying

1490
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:21,290
defense against it we have to start

1491
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:23,779
thinking way far way far out of the box

1492
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:25,970
than we currently are as a potential

1493
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:29,239
attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to defend against potential</font>

1494
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:31,130
attackers we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to look and it's</font>

1495
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:33,469
not just policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't deal with just</font>

1496
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:36,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulations we also have to change the</font>

1497
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:38,630
way that we think we really do<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise</font>

1498
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,220
it's going to take someone that's a

1499
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,770
little bit more pissed off and cynical

1500
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,739
than I am to go start throwing these

1501
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:51,529
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever and doing whatever with</font>

1502
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:54,620
them that's exactly let's have a chat

1503
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:59,000
about it i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> posting the slide up on</font>
