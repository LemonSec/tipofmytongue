this whole thing with digital currencies

I don't know who is John Galt

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,050
this is a pseudonym the individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

61
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,120
individuals who develop this have not

62

identified themselves but rather sore

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,050
when sinker but it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fiat digital</font>

64
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,790
currency which means it's not back by

65
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,300
anything other than the fact that

66
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,190
somebody said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exists open source so</font>

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,050
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the code its peer to</font>

76
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,120
completely decentralized there is no

77

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,620
arrest somebody and say shut down that

79
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,299
server because there is no centralized

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,049
server it was designed as in

81
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,720
peer-to-peer and because there's no

82
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,430
intermediary it allows for almost

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,620
frictionless transactions we'll get to

84
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,510
that in a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the way it's</font>

85
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,549
maintained is through a public ledger

86
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,410
it's all through a pseudonym you create

87
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,090
your artificial identities in fact are

88
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,700
automatically created to our it for you

89
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,380
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I transferred money for myself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,200
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in garden so here's money for</font>

91
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,170
you nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else would really know that I</font>

92
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,540
move money to be record of it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

93
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,399
somebody ties me or you to that

94
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,130
particular record or you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

95
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,019
it has that benefit now so the

96
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,730
advantages of a cryptocurrency lower

97
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,440
transaction costs theoretically

98
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,268
approaching zero although if you want to

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,980
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the game there's usually</font>

101
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,090
things like andreessen horowitz spending

dollars backing some of these crypto

104
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,620
currency exchanges remember the guys who

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,660
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money in 18-49 they got to keep</font>

actually discovered gold but the real

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
money was made by the people selling the

109
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,269
pickaxes and the shovels<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the miners</font>

more about this the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of increased</font>

privacy wow it's a pseudonymous pseudo

out is at by no means of anonymous but

119
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,610
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back to that and theoretically</font>

that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the insidious thing that</font>

probably argue this but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

176
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,490
point of this talk why the Fed decided

to pump hundreds of billions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars</font>

178
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,570
into the economy saying it's easier to

deal with inflation even high inflation

180
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,248
than it is to deal with deflation

181
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,809
because you've got to

182
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,429
goes on this side you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can control the</font>

money supply you can stop buying stuff

184
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:48,628
you can crank up the interest rate but

185
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:53,369
on the back end is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

use well it's wonderful from under

into Bitcoin I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely invisible</font>

to law enforcement i can move

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,109
forth in terms of criminal fraud well

209
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,489
I'm limited for credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card transactions</font>

210
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:44,039
it's tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a three million dollar</font>

211
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:46,198
transaction on a Visa card but it's

212
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,179
entirely plausible to do so in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

go ahead and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on tigerdirect but the</font>

216
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,879
reality is tigerdirect isn't really

217
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,979
taking bitcoins what they are doing is

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,169
they were dragging an exchange in front

219
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,318
of you so that when you deposit the

220
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:06,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin out pops a dollar bill for them</font>

221
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,069
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking any risk the risk</font>

more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the micro second it takes</font>

00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:15,509
although it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a micro second it's 10</font>

227
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,829
you're going to push the risk background

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,799
your consumer large sums across the

you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TSA line and they take a</font>

00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,910
because all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that heat generated from all</font>

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,600
the calculating will help offset some of

this

a Nobel Prize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that recently I think</font>

we should pull that back and set<font color="#E5E5E5"> party</font>

249
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,980
yeah way it works is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates a</font>

250
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,180
transaction lender there is no such

251
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,040
thing really is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin it's a</font>

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical thing but that's not the value</font>

253
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,469
rather what it is this is a series of

254
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,860
ledger entries it says from<font color="#CCCCCC"> A to B from</font>

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,019
B to C from C and D and C to B and all

256
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,360
these things chain down well at the end

257
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the period of time well how do we</font>

258
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,819
make sure we lock that thing down so

259
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that nobody goes back and changes the</font>

260
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:36,389
history well we do that by going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

261
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:38,550
and we have these transactions that are

262
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,560
posted to the laker and other people

263
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">will validate the ledger so I want you</font>

264
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,130
to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take this whole value</font>

265
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:50,579
produce a shot 256 hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing</font>

266
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that kind</font>

273
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,829
early days bitcoins are easy to mine

274

cube root of 8 6 4 3 2 99 and make it do

284
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,540
something and if it's a real mail

285
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,610
servers like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine I'll take the</font>

286
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,250
minute or second of transaction time

287
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,680
figure it out say the answer you clear

288
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,600
the spam filter but if somebody selling

289
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,130
out a million spams they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

290
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cyclist or the interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

291
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that work factor they can't validate the</font>

292
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:51,930
spams get<font color="#E5E5E5"> drunk well the idea got pulled</font>

293
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:55,500
into the currency so here's that load of

294
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,630
work when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this transaction ledger</font>

295
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,019
can we quit this digital tax we're using

296
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,360
a hashing algorithm which is you guys

297
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that say what hash algorithm is being</font>

298
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,410
used shot to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaw see a safe secure</font>

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,019
hash algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

300
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,910
56 bits well that's kind of well so what

301
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,370
who cares this easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculate but</font>

302
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,379
here's where it gets interesting now

303
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,269
what were you saying is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

304
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce a hash and pry you're familiar</font>

305
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,620
with what hashes do they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take an</font>

306
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,050
arbitrary input size and they will

307
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,680
condense it down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a distant output</font>

308
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,060
size hey win this is a good way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

309
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:36,180
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose weight there's no better than a</font>

310
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:38,160
laser pointer I think a babysitter whoo

311
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right then sell it to them right now</font>

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,699
400 grand you're both happy in any case

313
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,459
back to the prism vision already

314
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,550
scheduled what happens is this they say

315
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:53,660
well don't just give me any old<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256</font>

316
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:58,319
hatch I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shout 256 a show those</font>

317
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:00,420
256-bit the first n bits begin with

318
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,219
syrup well how am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do that</font>

319
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,660
it's like rolling the dice because with

320
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,329
the hash I could take it an arbitrary

321
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,819
input mangle it get some fixed link out

322
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:10,290
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I change one bit up here how many</font>

323
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,680
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bits on average will change down</font>

324
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,139
here half of them there's no such thing

325
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">as being close you either got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

326
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:21,029
spot-on or doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work at all so what</font>

327
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,310
you do is you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font>

328
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,490
transaction ledger I add one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

329
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,430
transaction issue 25 bitcoins to<font color="#E5E5E5"> G mark</font>

330
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,769
and then I have one more field<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a</font>

331
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:35,959
number used once so I throw one in there

332
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:39,089
and I stick it into my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 hashing</font>

333
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:45,029
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole and see what comes out 10</font>

334
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:47,339
to a half in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> run damn so 2010 3 and</font>

335
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:51,959
what I keep on doing is because I do

336
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:55,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a billion times 2 to the 20th</font>

337
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,489
is 1 billion and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average I can</font>

338
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,939
eventually I stumble into something it

339
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,649
begins with 20 000 000 serlo another

340
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:03,569
license plate or low number serial

341
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,790
number and a dollar value<font color="#E5E5E5"> go got it I</font>

342
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:07,529
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing and I race it up to the</font>

343
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,180
transaction ledger and I pushed it for

344
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone to see it said haha I was their</font>

345
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,300
first everybody else who's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

346
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,559
first of all those persons foiled again

347
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,969
but the goal invalidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

348
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,579
your transaction register and they will

349
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,600
calculate the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256</font>

350
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:26,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">hash with the transactions the one you</font>

351
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,429
added which says give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me 25 and the</font>

352
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,799
knots and lo and behold sure it does

353
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,959
begin with 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess this is</font>

354
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,879
legit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what happens is enough of them</font>

355
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,679
will vote on it if you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51-percent</font>

356
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,230
of the machines then say yea merrily

357
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,730
it's good and then everybody gives up

358
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,119
working on that problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you honor</font>

359
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,489
the next piece of chain to work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

360
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:49,230
auto adjust itself but about every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

361
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:51,689
minutes this thing spits out some

362
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,809
bitcoins it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

363
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:57,629
trail off to eventually about 21 million

364
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,610
coins and this work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a factor does</font>

365
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:03,209
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to go back and forge a</font>

366
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,220
transaction I could try that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I could</font>

367
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a billion cycles and eventually</font>

368
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,959
calculate a hash that would work but by

369
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,819
then what's happened well the world's

370
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,799
moved on there's more transactions I

371
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,410
gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> forge that one and forge that one</font>

372
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,850
and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that the work factor</font>

373
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,769
makes it so you're in a hopeless tell

374
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,779
chase if you're trying to forge and if

375
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:25,230
the chain splits<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get little</font>

376
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,970
alternatives the shortest chain loses it

377
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,059
gets flicked off it gets prune the

378
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,610
longest one lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> and off you go so how</font>

379
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,769
do you get bit coin um you could buy

380
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,419
them there are currency exchanges where

381
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,089
you can go ahead and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take real</font>

382
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,799
current currency and say yay verily I

383
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,899
want to swap this thing or this pile of

384
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,639
things for some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a Bitcoin and</font>

385
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,980
they will do it for you for a percentage

386
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there's money to be made selling the</font>

387
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,480
pickaxes and the shovels right here you

388
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,549
could also go ahead and exchange him for

389
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,910
goods or services I think they're

390
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:57,839
prostitutes now who will take Bitcoin

391
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,309
all right make sure where you insert

392
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,759
them but you can use your imagination

393
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:04,709
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find out is that what did</font>

394
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,299
you say tigerdirect is doing some

395
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,459
universities are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's now</font>

396
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:09,989
more of a public relations done to say

397
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,839
we take Bitcoin because it gets you a

398
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:15,929
nose broadcast and otherwise unused

399
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,989
worthy organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe's pizza now</font>

400
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:20,639
takes Bitcoin makes the national news or

401
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:23,160
you could mine them and that's this

402
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,509
process I told you of cranking away

403
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,569
because the work factor gets harder as

404
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,789
more people try it auto adjusts its like

405
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:34,430
those exercise we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tractor</font>

406
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:35,779
pulls we had to wait ms amore

407
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,579
tractor pulls of the weight shifts that

408
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,050
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it harder and harder and harder so</font>

409
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,850
the early days bitcoins are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

410
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,790
to mind with mind on your laptop your

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,750
spare time like a set a screen saver but

412
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you have to get faster and faster</font>

413
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">when two graphics processing units and</font>

414
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,160
now we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point now where they</font>

fpgas aren't even fast enough so people

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,750
are making and selling for thousands of

tail off over time they cut the reward

434
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,130
who cares but think about it if I went

435
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,040
down to the six decimal point and call

436
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,420
that a dollar in today with pro million

437
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,880
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be about the equivalent</font>

of 12 trillion dollars and the m1 money

439
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,040
supply is about 11 trillion dollars so

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> already in circulation enough sly</font>

well if all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin really</font>

456
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,670
took hold and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

457
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,620
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like swapping the coin back and</font>

458
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,620
forth and they're not using US dollars

459
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,350
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a US Fed try to control or</font>

460
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,419
influence in the US economy or any other

461
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,850
countries equivalent of the Fed with a

462
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,890
fiat currency do that or have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax it</font>

463
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,330
or even detect it and tax it and

464
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,070
regulate it and moderate it and track it

465
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,059
also

466
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,669
because the demand for real currency

467
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,620
goes down I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how big my</font>

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,790
happening now a monetary policy gets

470
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,370
very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult because it's no</font>

471
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer oh let me go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy up</font>

472
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:07,189
bonds or buy up Treasury backed

473
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,840
securities or change my short-term

474
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,610
interest rates and hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can pull</font>

475
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,159
the long-term rates around I don't get

476
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">those controls anymore and there's</font>

477
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,390
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called network externa</font>

478
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,800
externalities basically given a choice

479
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,830
you're going to pick a currency that you

480
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognize over one that you don't</font>

481
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,490
theoretically the government could

482
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,889
influence that though it involve it well

483
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,390
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Silk Road yeah</font>

484
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,280
yeah they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> government's one of the</font>

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,660
bigger holders a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin right now but</font>

486
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,309
as we say right now in the United States

487
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,990
you feel more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to greenbacks</font>

488
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:38,300
but let's go there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

489
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">externalities who has to swap some money</font>

490
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,290
for this this is my souvenir from<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">your input when I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with them</font>

494
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,270
what we see as we say in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US we like</font>

495
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,740
US dollars we get canadian coins and our

496
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,330
change under up near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border and you</font>

497
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,440
are not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually they're kind of</font>

498
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,270
work a little bit more another<font color="#E5E5E5"> worthless</font>

499
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,400
but general we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for things</font>

500
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,110
that we recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that are</font>

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,270
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> against bitcoin is there</font>

502
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,040
technically not legal tender although

503
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:14,240
they're generally accepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can trade</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you to bearskins and a cow exchange for</font>

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,590
something else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it works it works</font>

506
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,740
it's still kind of sort of maybe in the

507
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,149
barter system but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is IRS has</font>

508
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,830
never figured out attacks the barter

509
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,360
system effectively and so we probably

510
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,600
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it that way</font>

511
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,040
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet generally accepted I go</font>

512
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,919
back and I go the airplane I go ahead

over what a roller coaster ride is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

523
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,350
concurrency it's a commodity and a very

524
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,908
volatile one at that or think of it as a

525
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,949
dot-com stock in 1999 come

526
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:05,440
with no earnings and no product but a

527
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,139
lot of promise and so people did the bit

528
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,840
about and so what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> then because</font>

529
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:12,789
it's driven by speculation rather than

530
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">being the preferred means of exchange</font>

531
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,320
it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to make money but in</font>

532
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,029
most cases in speculation who makes the

533
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:25,059
money very few the pit got the pickaxe

534
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:27,279
sellers a guy run on the exchange or

535
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,928
early adopters which brings us to an

536
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,749
interesting question as we look at who

537
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:35,549
are the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopters and who's got the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hordes of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin oops back up one and</font>

539
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:40,989
so Congress has some issues to say about

540
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,369
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

541
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,109
the Constitution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the United States</font>

542
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:46,840
Congress has the authority to coin money

543
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:49,149
and to regulate the value thereof so if

544
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,220
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider this to be money all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:58,529
back during the Civil War metal coins

548
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,940
almost disappeared from existence

549
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,279
figures value<font color="#E5E5E5"> in metal right there and</font>

550
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,649
so you could exchange postage stamps for

551
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,389
fractional currency but the Stamp Act

552
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:10,268
said nobody else can issue fractional

553

573
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,259
the it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Satoshi you know</font>

574
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">button here's the cool thing about it in</font>

575
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:06,190
the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days who cared about this</font>

576
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:08,080
nobody and in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days did you get</font>

577
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,690
more or fewer bitcoins period of time

578
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,939
more and in the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days was it easier</font>

579
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,179
harder to mine or calculate the bitcoins

580
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,730
much easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes</font>

581
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,800
therefore it's possible that the early

582
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,220
eyes who started this thing have amassed

583
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,830
about 1 million or so bitcoins the US

584

585
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,370
155,000 of them making US government

613
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:34,270
sort of complied with that just didn't

614
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,219
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it coming and so it's starting to</font>

615
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,679
hit mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've started looking at</font>

616
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,690
Bitcoin back in March of 2011 when

617
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,190
Forbes ran an article on it saying this

618
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,080
thing is about run its course it's gone

619
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a fraction of a penny to always one</font>

620
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,720
dollar and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw go up to a</font>

621
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,929
thousand dollars and who knows maybe to

622
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,670
go back again but think about it if the

623
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,620
value of this currency is based on

624
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,990
scarcity and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only thing</font>

625
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,699
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at artificial scarcity scarcity</font>

book science and persuasion things such

as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority will give you a chance to</font>

630
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,800
influence others scarcity<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of them</font>

631
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,890
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> only three tickets remain sale ends</font>

632
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,240
at midnight tonight by right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now or</font>

633
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,780
social proof everybody else doing it

634
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,220
fashion relies on that so my assertion

635
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,190
is is that what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

636
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,540
psychological entity it's being

637
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,780
considered by

638
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,120
those believers to be a currency and

639
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,520
economic instrument but in fact it's a

640
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,860
psychological instrument because it's

641
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">only value is in the human psychology if</font>

642
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually looked at it abstractly if</font>

643
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,639
you could be a Vulcan it would be

644
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,780
illogical and it wouldn't work now it's

645
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,480
interesting you take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

646
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,820
yesterday's news last night<font color="#E5E5E5"> JD mortgage</font>

647
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,730
a CEO denounces bitcoin is terrible

648
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,439
britax his downfall and as you see this

649
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing came out less than 24 hours ago on</font>

650
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wire he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically saying it's</font>

651
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,720
a terrible story value and he's right

652
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,700
for the perspective that the volatility

653
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,520
it's here to snap where you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

654
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,050
put your fortune that said you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

655
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,510
play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while sure</font>

656
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:16,870
think about like going to Vegas but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

657
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:18,879
don't have to leave the house now<font color="#CCCCCC"> kid</font>

658
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,889
would you accept bitcoins and David for

659
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,450
your work yeah would you be happy accept

660
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,310
bitcoins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and knowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you couldn't</font>

661
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,080
get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at least that'll day</font>

662
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,940
or two until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually got exchanged</font>

663
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,060
some people who are believers would

664
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,580
others because it's so volatile would

665
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,260
not and so therefore you got to judge

666
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,419
yourself based upon that<font color="#E5E5E5"> high high</font>

667
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,190
volatility tough to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that</font>

668
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">are highly volatile right now but you</font>

669
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,690
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of them is something that</font>

670
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,640
might come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go like those spin of a</font>

671
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,100
wheel at a roulette<font color="#E5E5E5"> table which you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange this value of your services for</font>

673
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,830
whatever number comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next my numbers</font>

674
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,560
36 or 37 because there's no 37 so you're

675
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,230
safe with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but any other number you</font>

676
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,669
might get lower make it more so my

677
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,740
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you may not be interested in</font>

678
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS but the IRS is interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

679
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,770
with apologies to plugged in or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenin</font>

680
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:11,320
and the idea there is is that if it can

681
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,850
be imagined it can be taxed and what

682
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,740
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is that if this</font>

683
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,020
continues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on and crypto</font>

684
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,190
currencies will work my personal

685
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,260
prediction is are going to go the way of

686
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,940
Napster where Napster came out as a

687
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,500
great peer-to-peer file sharing system

688
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,420
everybody loves it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of real</font>

689
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,280
believers and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music industry</font>

690
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,870
banking industry being the corollary

691
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,910
says whoa we're losing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of profits</font>

692
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is my province goes rent singing to</font>

693
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,110
the government hey we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut</font>

694
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,210
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down government snacks abound but</font>

695
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,530
then somebody smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> new job says women</font>

696
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,900
make a big money with that we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

697
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">itunes and so back comes a business</font>

698
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,170
model that blessed by the government

699
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,670
by corporations because companies can go

700
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,460
ahead and buy more congressman than the

701
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,620
preneur skin and the laws are favorable

702
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,890
so we'll come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some form of a</font>

703
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,989
digital cryptocurrency but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> son suggest</font>

704
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,740
it's not going to be this it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

705
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,240
something I don't know what but today

706
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,710
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build a weapon because</font>

707
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the interactive part I want you</font>

708
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,990
to think evil that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a Lex</font>

709
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:11,500
Luthor big total global domination yes

<font color="#E5E5E5">people your fingers you skip the last</font>

711
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:17,470
part of previous slide oh he's got oh

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah who is Bitcoin positive you know</font>

713
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,910
look cameron and tyler winklevoss or the

<font color="#CCCCCC">vinca x is the proper plural</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think and</font>

715
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,180
big holders because they want to set up

716
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,280
an exchange the department of justice

717
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,140
and of course the Satoshi's quite i

718
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,639
mentioned i was already in passing but

719
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,770
the idea is is if there's some people

720
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,800
that make them make big bets on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

721
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,960
hard part is easy mining is already been

722
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,550
done now you have to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

723
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,140
really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horsepower and you</font>

724
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,879
pretty much joined guilds and these some

725
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,190
of these guilds are about forty percent

726
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">above the total amount of miners now</font>

727
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,050
remember the danger when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

728
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">51-percent you could forage that block</font>

729
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,240
chain you could rewrite history and now

730
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,130
you could create artificial transactions

731
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,870
and you always win on the boat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

732
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,490
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep putting in fake transaction</font>

733
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,439
after fake transaction nobody can

734
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,600
outvote you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could empty out the</font>

735
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,890
system well eventually the argument

736
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,080
against that is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people lose face</font>

737
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,840
with it and all the money you put into

738
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,639
it would get lost and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore you</font>

739
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,310
would no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer hit it remember these</font>

740
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,410
guilds aren't run by a democracy or

741
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,360
consensus to run by one central

742
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,040
individual who farms out all this worked

743
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,629
all these individual people you get to

744
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,139
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of the guild okay i</font>

compared contributed point zero zero one

746
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,410

<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of the payout put again the guy</font>

749
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:43,750

<font color="#E5E5E5">bitcoin number sure if you didn't</font>

751
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,900
understand how it worked but as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

752
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,670
you went ahead and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a</font>

753
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,250
transaction because the way you control

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public-private key pair</font>

00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,519
your private key the idea being is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

757
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:59,320
going to do a transaction you can sign

00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,629
the transaction as the seller the

transport or of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin with your</font>

what happens when your wallets are

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,709
strolling people are printing them out

768
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,149
and putting them on pieces of paper so

769
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,240
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not in electronic</font>

770

<font color="#E5E5E5">format gee did they do you know how much</font>

773
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,330
over time well they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 40,000</font>

774
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,460
transactions a day right now I don't

775
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,199
know the dollar value on average<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

776
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,570
you could go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could go</font>

777
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,090
through that transaction transaction

778
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,908
 you got five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or the data go</font>

779
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,830
find a big data data miner and you can

780
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,720
produce all kinds of stuff but if I

781
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,879
transferred money to you and I have an

782
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,590
to sit around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for your public</font>

783

key to show up again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I know</font>

784
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,970
that you offloaded it to somebody else

785
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,189
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not anonymous if I see your</font>

786
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,929
laptop is law enforcement and I could

787
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,090
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your private key I get your</font>

788
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:03,970
private public key I see every single

789
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,009
transaction you did and so unlike doing

790
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:09,700
a transaction I'm selling or buying

791
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:11,230
illegal goods in an alleyway and then

792
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,240
law enforcement comes by said well those

793
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,980
weren't my hundred dollar bills have

794
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,899
fingerprints on there's no DNA I never

795
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,360
saw you can't prove anything now we've

796
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:21,219
got rock-solid cryptographic evidence

797
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,869
that it was you where do you know new in

798
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,259
court are you that the Bitcoin<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos</font>

799
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:28,570
bad so the anonymity that seems to

800
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,220
appeal to organized crime is more based

801
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,899
on the ignorance of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

805
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,419
let's get back to our task<font color="#E5E5E5"> again can we</font>

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,279
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and build a weapon with this</font>

happens when you have a thinly traded

and broke the back of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> British Pound</font>

George Charles had to work pretty hard

10 figures to bet work but here we're

1036

saying somebody could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 figures to</font>

publishing a white paper now pretty good

1039
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,799
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're seeing all these</font>

West days so that's why i said if you

00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,360
want to build your

1047
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,820
the number one mind coin because think

00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:13,589
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the majority of the electrical</font>

1049
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:16,200
energy being used of mine these days

1050
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:18,030
it's going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> in dogecoin because</font>

1051
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,980
it's considered easier to get them than

1052
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,660
it is to go ahead and get a Bitcoin

1053
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,450
because the number of transactions

1054
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">required the calculations so people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1055
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,100
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for easier to solve things</font>

1056
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,230
and remember it's an emotional currency

1057
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,850
in my opinion make people<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel good</font>

1058
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,960
about mining they will come to you if

1059
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you build it they will mine it well</font>

1060
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">assuming that there's an upper limit on</font>

1061
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">minors yes and it makes sense that once</font>

1062
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,729
currencies get to a certain level to be

1063
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,640
that most of the miners would start

1064
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:52,740
shifting or the non gilded miners the

1065
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,540
the free miners yeah would start

1066
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,160
shifting to lure currency where they

1067
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,560
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more chance of success</font>

1068
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,330
absolutely which then would suggest an

1069
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,670
infinite stream of new digital

1070
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:05,190
currencies with an easier work factor

1071
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,350
but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that creates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question how</font>

1072
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,390
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I convert them back they go through</font>

1073
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:11,640
those exchanges we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

1074
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,350
currencies are going to flame out many

1075
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them probably will at some point but</font>

1076
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,480
right now they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all playing somebody</font>

1077
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,560
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the plates spinning at once</font>

1078
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,360
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> are starting to wobble come</font>

1079
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,250
some are still spinning up but right now

1080
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
you could cop from plate to plate to

1081
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,060
plate can you come up with a strategy

1082
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,440
how about arbitrage you go and look at

1083
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the major exchanges they are not</font>

1084
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,220
synchronized if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go ahead and with</font>

1085
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,630
enough capital in the background because

1086
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,430
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things don't clear immediately but</font>

1087
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,910
I can book transactions and lock them

1088
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:40,710
down by here at 880 so over there at

1089
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,390
nine hundred and do that all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

1090
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,070
well eventually what's going to happen

1091
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,549
if I got a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> arbitrage in the middle</font>

1092
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,930
you're all going to harmonize the prices

1093
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,120
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to settle out because I've</font>

1094
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:53,250
squeezed the inefficiency out of the

1095
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,589
market which does what for the market

1096
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,780
they feel confident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which means</font>

1097
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to start to do this and all</font>

1098
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,220
the arbitrage you they squeeze that will

1099
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,260
now rise in value I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better I saw</font>

1100
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,149
it all along<font color="#CCCCCC"> away because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now the</font>

1101
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,410
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the minors the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1102
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:13,410
wave of competition is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

1103
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:14,609
arbitrage errs right I want you guys to

1104
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell me</font>

1105
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:19,950
giving you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools I'm Lex Luthor I</font>

1106
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:24,329
want you to build me something an evil

1107
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:26,038
genius but I'm delegating well<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">side you want to attack you can't attack</font>

1109
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,269
do you want to attack the legitimate

1110
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:35,730
currencies in the legitimate nation

1111
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:38,808
states or do i attack the new currencies

1112
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,920
the exchanges give me a no plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both</font>

1113
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,539
well you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> given us the plan</font>

1114
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,130
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nations yeah God doing you kind</font>

1115
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of yelp I have a plan so let's think of</font>

1116
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,910
other closet artists take the exchanges

1117
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,819
all you have to do is identify the

1118
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,440
actors right<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old school and throw</font>

1119
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,900
them a few phishing messages and see you

1120
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,190
buy it could mess with them that way so

1121
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,079
a lot of the old tools will still work

1122
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,049
there you're going after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the soft target</font>

1123
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,390
setting up the meat as a carbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1124
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:07,230
silicon but what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do is for me a</font>

1125
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:11,759
new mining guild mm-hmm and possibly

1126
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:13,859
start my own currency and so because the

had the information 12 hours in their

1150
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,710
dates so i will pick an industry or I'll

1151
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,460
take an area of critical infrastructure

1152
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:15,509
in the nation or you wherever else and I

1153

1156
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:22,049
do an industry you could and in fact go

1157
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,489
back to Scott Borg and some of the

1158
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,349
things that Scott was able to do in some

1159
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:27,830
of these war games where you go ahead

1160
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:30,410
and you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over these very very low</font>

1161
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,330
in critical industries like a total ball

1162
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,980
bearing manufacturers if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,590
economy particularly on a wartime

1165
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:40,040
footing if they no longer have access

1166
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,390
the ball bearings yeah we know we don't

1167
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,490
guard the ball bearing Factory you want

1168
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,230
to go to war but yet take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out could</font>

against the exchanges right how about

1178
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,020
this I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and I give a call over</font>

1179

1184
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,190
three milliseconds we don't need 10

1185
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,259
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all of a sudden what happens</font>

1186
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,640
is the whole currency is all shifting

1187
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,670
over the rest but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going over to</font>

1188
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,190
Fort me I'd rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> take over each stage</font>

1189
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:34,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then use that if my perspectives</font>

1190
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,910
from government use the exchange maybe

1191
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,710
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even skim off of it make sure I'm</font>

1192
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,810
the most attractive exchange out there

1193
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,630
so everybody goes through me but now

1194
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:46,250
everybody's going through me I know

1195
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,770
where the money's going and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1199
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:58,300
along the lines of what might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more</font>

1200
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,380
proper use of a national level asset in

1201
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,630
information space to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

1202
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,190
and track those transactions and trying

00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,010
to look for arms transfers and things

1204
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,260
like that assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little Johnny</font>

1207
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,330
you ignore that well how do you make

1208
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,009
your exchange more valuable or more

1209
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,569
attractive to other people than the ones

1210
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:21,350
that are out there right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now max my</font>

1212

1213
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,399
trustworthy because they're having fake

1214
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,190
ones that have come up so how do you

1215

as it came from so it's on a sawtooth up

1266
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,950
but at some point in time it's either

still an alternate means<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exchange</font>

financial crises and crashes and things

1369
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,049
like that it turns out though that if

1370
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,849
you have a central controlling body and

1371
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:41,788
you go to a fiat currency and you

1372
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:44,520
actually manage it correctly when your

1373
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:46,200

instead of 10 it's a deflationary thing

1385
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:13,650
and therein lies the danger with all of

a crypto fiat currency

1389
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,120
with a central bank someone to affect

1390

1419
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,680
we're still chasing our official<font color="#E5E5E5"> coils</font>

1420
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,570
mr. Chief weaponized right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go</font>

1421
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,790
back to information warfare or

1422
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:50,130
operations in cyberspace and we

1423
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:52,350
determined that the brutal value of

1424
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,240
measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effectiveness was its impact</font>

1425
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:57,210
on the perception of decision makers of

1426
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-making apparatus or in the</font>

1427
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:02,240
actual outcomes in the real world so

1428
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:06,360
just as they said it's not operations in

1429
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,220
cyberspace if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go ahead and alter all</font>

1430
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,420
your files on your archives you never

1431
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,270
ever look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them again until you die</font>

1432
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,850
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasted time but if I can change</font>

1433
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:17,100
your perception I win and so what I want

1434
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,779
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I want to have some physical</font>

1435
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,060
effect that I can take back out to meet

1436
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,800
space remember this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a dream you</font>

1437
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">can dream</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about seeing a lot of money</font>

1438
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can put your hands on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it</font>

1439
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,420
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work when you wake up you'll</font>

1440
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,740
still laying in bed you don't have the

1441
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,780
money with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it doesn't come out that</font>

1442
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,169
way the only real value from the

1443
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,270
internet

1444
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,280
in to meet space is if you could extract

1445
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,869
money out of it the only way you do that

1446
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,490
is he convince somebody to exchange

1447
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,450
whatever it is you did in there or

1448
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,399
something they're doing out here and

1449
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:44,759
thus goes back to psychological

1450
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,130
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dark matter in the</font>

1451
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,829
universe yeah well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the</font>

1452
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:51,030
person that taught George<font color="#E5E5E5"> no scratching</font>

1453
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:53,549
their head or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drive out</font>

1454
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:58,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">China right it was about changing</font>

1455
00:55:53,549 --> 00:56:00,569
people's perception yeah and so we've

1456
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,740
effectively done that we've changed the

1457
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:06,779
perception of the value of national

1458
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,790
currencies yeah and so you've been

1459
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,770
artificially hold it down which we've

1460
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,450
accused of Chinese of doing you can pay

1461
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,220
your currency to somebody else's or you

1462
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,569
can do it some nations in Europe have

1463
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,430
done to take a free ride and somebody

1464
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">else is being responsible and being</font>

1465
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,399
relatively irresponsible cause you're

1466
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,010
spending at which point you create

1467
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,329
massive frictions and crises with your

1468
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:29,240
national bonds even though you have

1469
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:29,240
euros from with derivative<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rollo</font>
