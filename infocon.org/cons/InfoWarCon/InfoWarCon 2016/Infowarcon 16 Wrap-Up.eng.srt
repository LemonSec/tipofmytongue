in the world or

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,710
powerful films about Frankenstein and

3
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:26,869
other pieces I have a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> text here</font>

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,669
that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent the last hour and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

5
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,210
half or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting together so hopefully</font>

6
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:35,300
it will it will do as justice it's been

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,489
a great dialogue certainly a really

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,260
powerful one and remember we started

9
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this concept of cyber kinetic and</font>

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,059
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been the backdrop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,790
last two days how exactly are we

12
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:49,459
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about impact defense deterrence</font>

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:54,710
and to quote a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> when made on day</font>

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:57,619
one when will we ever learn right how do

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,439
we learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the past in order to go</font>

16
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,420
forward and how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font>

17
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,150
drones autonomous systems and other

<font color="#CCCCCC">mechanisms in what I call innovations</font>

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:12,200
and the ovations that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to</font>

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:15,200
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> right Texas Chainsaw drones I</font>

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,350
to each other um and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

24
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:28,850
the acceptance of unexpected yet legal

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,678
inputs it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that human element</font>

26
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,780
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always so fascinating because</font>

27
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:35,200
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will think about putting these</font>

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,499
pieces and parts together in ways that

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,689
the designers never imagined but that's

30
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:45,560
the real power of<font color="#E5E5E5"> human innovations in</font>

31
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:47,508
this space and ovations um as we go

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,880
forward and so there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot we have a</font>

33
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,560
lot of a talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not this</font>

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,208
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a different how is this going</font>

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,779
to impact lives how is this going to

36
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:02,029
impact warfighting how is the technology

37
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:04,069
going to go forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

following the world inside the beltway

39
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:08,149
you've heard a great deal about by the

Secretary of Defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Deputy</font>

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">industrial era and how we are offsetting</font>

44
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:22,069
the dramatic imbalance that's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

45

cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Defense Department to defend</font>

47
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,270
and we have equated we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

48
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,880
technological parity

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,650
around the world right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. used to</font>

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,079
have the advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> with nuclear weapons</font>

51

<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage with network connectivity are</font>

54
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,140
yet but the the Western world the

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,570
concept from their perspective is that

56
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're facing a need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offset that</font>

57
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,640
disadvantage again and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,730
all-in if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FY 17 budget</font>

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,309
all in on this concept of autonomous

60
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,859
deep learning machines on the concept of

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,110
an analytic capability growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

62
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine collaboration assisted human</font>

63
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,860
operations advanced machine teams and

64
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,320
semi-autonomous weaponry right so we

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,990
have huge investments in this country

66
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">from our defense industrial base into</font>

67
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,870
this environment until I was really

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,530
struck by that because it is that human

69
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,900
component that is so vital<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's that</font>

70
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,880
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aha moment that happened</font>

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">yesterday if you if you didn't realize</font>

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,950
it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about how do we</font>

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,580
create enough time and space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

74
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,890
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes sense how do we do</font>

75
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:50,240
this in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we recognize</font>

76
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:53,958
there's a I need to to respond quickly

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a political pressure from the</font>

78
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,250
population when one bad thing happens

79
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,160
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to respond in a</font>

80
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,900
proportional way um and it got us to

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,180
thinking last night over<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinks I was</font>

82
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a number of conversations testing</font>

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,190
out some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these concepts and it</font>

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,040
came down to how do we have a

85
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,390
philosophical foundation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
talking about and what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

87
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,750
not pervaded today right that pervaded

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,550
the whole afternoon in today what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,470
philosophical foundation for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

90
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,570
thinking how does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

91
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,440
decision-making how do we have a

92
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,419
strategy about what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing informed</font>

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,820
in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that got</font>

94
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,590
summed up so beautifully yesterday by

95
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,070
one of our Swedish colleagues without

96
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,510
here where they said scared people make

97
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:46,560
stupid decisions

98
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">right in one sentence what's the</font>

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,860
philosophical foundation scared people

100
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,690
make stupid decisions haired voters if

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,520
that's a what one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that's</font>

102
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,110
very real for us in this country right

103
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">now because we're watching what's</font>

104
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:06,390
happening in the political sphere here

105
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:09,960
and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> got me thinking if all of</font>

106
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,659
this is true how do we succeed when

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,820
there are so many aspects that need to

108
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,230
be coordinated<font color="#E5E5E5"> across a large spectrum</font>

109
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,360
of participants in such a rapid manner I

110
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,160
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variables we're having</font>

111
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,790
to process just<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last two days</font>

112
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and certainly in our lives every day how</font>

113
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,100
do we do this and we actually answered

114
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,730
that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I'm Randy you date</font>

115
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,820
you gave us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step what is that</font>

116
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,850
common narrative in the conversation we

117
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,700
were having about<font color="#E5E5E5"> drones and swarming</font>

118
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,220
theory versus a symmetry theory in this

119
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,539
how do we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the goals I think</font>

120
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,940
that is you made that comment what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

121
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,310
the goals that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work towards</font>

122
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,230
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that common narrative and</font>

123
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,180
that goal statement so that it lets us

124
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,040
all function in this incredibly

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:04,960
complicated environment

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,340
but are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking in the right way our</font>

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,370
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> makers thinking in the right</font>

128
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,219
way how do we continue to question that

129
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,980
how we think how do we acknowledge and

130
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,640
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking is a learned</font>

131
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,210
skill and you can learn new<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of</font>

132
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking and that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we</font>

133
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,560
talked about modularity and freedom of

134
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,780
movement is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good it</font>

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,020
certainly seems always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good we think</font>

136
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,179
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always good is there always a human</font>

137
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,830
on the other end I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot in</font>

138
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,130
cyber kinetic kind of thinking right

139
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,280
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in terms of of</font>

140
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,230
autonomous systems but there's a

141
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,840
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> maker a thinker on the other</font>

142
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:51,370
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have to realize there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

143
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,310
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there somewhere if there isn't or if</font>

144
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,220
there is where are they really and how

145
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,230
do I impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> them where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

146
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,020
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an action that's being taken</font>

147
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,600
someplace else and so dismiss me we have

148
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,349
to pecans yesterday made the comment

149
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,360
about nonlinear thinking how do we

150
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,950
change the way we understand we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all have</font>

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,600
our sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of native thinking style so how</font>

152
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,880
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the way we understand</font>

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,920
things as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this moment that</font>

154
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,650
Scott brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward right we're moving</font>

155
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an Enlightenment era of culture to</font>

156
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,960
a new culture as of yet unnamed kind of

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,210
environment what is it what's being

158
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,489
replaced with and how are we in this

159
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,979
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the other rooms with all</font>

160
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,320
the other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were engaging with</font>

161
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,040
really shaping the thing that it's being

<font color="#E5E5E5">replaced with</font>

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,440
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep saying I know we heard it a</font>

164
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,050
couple of times<font color="#CCCCCC"> here right this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font>

165
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,340
making people more aware of the threat

166
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,380
creating better coordination between

167
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,260
government entities<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decree government</font>

168
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,020
sectors across private entities how far

169
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,150
is this thinking going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us</font>

170
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,490
how does this relate to the cyber

171
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,859
insurgency and counterinsurgency model

172
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:08,419
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the context</font>

173
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,340
of private entities privateers and and

174
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,580
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you call a digital Blackwater</font>

175
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,080
entities who's got what roles who's got

176
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,219
what responsibilities where our

177
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,419
individual roles and responsibilities

178
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,860
fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo how when how do we incorporate</font>

179
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,229
that into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrative we tell</font>

180
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,300
ourselves the ones we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> our allies</font>

181
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:35,860
the ones we tell our address

182
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:37,930
so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> war time anymore right we're</font>

183
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,990
in a world of false choices and

184
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:44,500
certainly this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a false choice is it</font>

185
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,800
work is it peace is it black is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it white</font>

186
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,630
is it good is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bad what is it we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

187
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,819
in this world of false choices and we

188
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,189
have to break out of that kind of

189
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,260
construct is it hybrid war is it

190
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,980
political what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to name it</font>

191
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,319
we're seeking handles he's keeping

192
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,290
operations how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move beyond that</font>

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,250
how do we describe the nuances that

194
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,949
we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and involved in and</font>

195
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:17,290
really interestingly we don't understand

196
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:21,340
I think what it means to win whatever

197
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,469
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> were in right is win</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus lose</font>

198
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,970
even the important thing and from a

199
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,500
conversation at dinner last night with a

200
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,840
few of us we were having<font color="#E5E5E5"> this discussion</font>

201
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:34,750
about is winning a temporal thing right

202
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,050
I have declared victory it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

203
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,810
this second

204
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,449
and what happens a second later right

205
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,979
and what happens a minute later and what

206
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,190
happens a week later a month later<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

207
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">year later a decade later and what does</font>

208
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in the way we are in the way</font>

209
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,439
we're thinking um and so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

210
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,010
how does the concept of disruptive

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,590
reorganization I'm into here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright we</font>

212
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard her that</font>

213
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,510
we talked a lot around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edges on</font>

214
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,810
geography so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a quote</font>

215
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,640
from mice now<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 year old son why is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

216
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,579
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take geography the world is</font>

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,080
changing so fast it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

218
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,510
anything anymore I now mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you aah you</font>

219
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,350
took geography but but it's a legitimate

220
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,970
question right what does geographical

221
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,750
boundary need

222
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,930
because how do we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sustaining</font>

223
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,449
the concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this state or the nation</font>

224
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,609
in a virtual context right as those

225
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,219
those boundaries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> geographic</font>

226
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,850
pressures and boundaries and borders go

227
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:51,639
away in our minds where do we create or

228
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:53,560
establish this ideal a of little fact if

229
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,740
you didn't know the nation of Estonia is

230
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,859
working very very hard not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to be</font>

231
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:03,430
the most digitized government but to

232
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,949
establish and sustain Estonia once their

233
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,109
borders are<font color="#E5E5E5"> over then they acknowledge</font>

234
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:11,189
and know that this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality for them</font>

235
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,829
and want their identity to pervade I

236
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:16,389
think about a Star Trek episode all

237
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,750
right think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this might mean</font>

238
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:23,130
and so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the context of this in</font>

239
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,620
this autonomous system world

240
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,810
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamic</font>

241
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,020
interactions of constantly changing sets

242
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,420
of problems patterns patterning patterns

243
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,699
as we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolving from this</font>

244
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,699
enlightenment and area that's industrial

245
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,210
based concept in the future that dynamic

246
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">dynamis ism that we have to work with</font>

247
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:47,490
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> within that is that chaos and</font>

248
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,880
we've been reminded that chaos creates

249
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,880
space

250
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume intensity and complexity and</font>

251
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,030
information does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal intellectual</font>

252
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,000
value

253
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,000
I really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,740
know in my in my day job I face this all

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,690
the time who are you trying to talk to

256
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,910
what are you trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get across from</font>

257
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,460
them don't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what you know tell</font>

258
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,430
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they want to know I bridge</font>

259
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,590
that gap here and how do we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

260
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,630
filling that space I was so thrilled by

261
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,840
the last night's<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation about we</font>

262
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,090
can fill that space with art we can fill

263
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,280
that space with positive things that we

264
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,500
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize are happening what we have</font>

265
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,350
to be we have to recognize we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

266
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,230
it in a conscious<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy-based</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">intentional engagement with a narrative</font>

268
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that we're just filling</font>

269
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,850
the space with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mikhail we're creating</font>

270
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:45,970
more room or counter narratives that we

271
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want and so this isn't going to</font>

272
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">make any sense but I want you to take a</font>

273
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,110
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look around in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there are 43 participants</font>

275
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,220
there are four women

276
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,410
of diversity in this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is vital</font>

277
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,740
right we cannot keep thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

278
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,430
way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got here will get us out and so</font>

279
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,120
whatever the diverse opinions

280
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:17,239
conversations perspectives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find</font>

281
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,220
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important as we as we go</font>

282
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,220
forward here again struck by the fact

283
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,500
that so many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the artists that were</font>

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,140
speaking out where women in oppressive

environment

286
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,630
and so to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quote here from you</font>

287
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,820
know one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our potentially</font>

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,810
and my quote last night art is the

290
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,350
closest lie to the truth we spend a lot

291
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,449
of time in sort of the underlying

truth versus reality versus perception

294
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,869
right we are back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that false choice</font>

295
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,490
what facts are a false choice if I want

296
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to counter the thing that people are</font>

301
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,350
heard that from the Frankenstein theory

302
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,259
right that's the Frankenstein premise

303
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,660
what is the evidentiary base of security

304
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,250
and it's not a technological base right

305
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,100
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mathematical proof that we</font>

can be secure absolutely is there a map

is there a proof a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human a human proof</font>

whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks like for a nation is</font>

310
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:38,960
the real question and what does our<font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font>

320
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:08,900
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are patterns we can use as</font>

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,760
we're defining the new patterns people

has their track record then in terms of

picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right side how do we really</font>

impact

336
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,840
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think any conversation</font>

about this challenge right how do we

they're the marginally franchised and

348
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,140
the disenfranchised oh they're going to

349
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,820
find people who think like they do who

are they they're going to find

351
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,580
narratives but they resonate with and

352
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,739
that's going to change all kinds of

in expected ways because of this

particular pressure which<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings us back</font>

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very human component of this it</font>

366
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,188
narrative right it's how do we put this

367
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,780
together because computers in computing

368
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,730
are articulated through that worldview

369
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,470
it used to be the chief information

370
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,870
officer of a large information

371
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,770
technology agency and regularly people

372
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:26,708
would say the IT system sucks right why

373
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,020
is it so bloody hard to do this or why

374
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,630
can't that one talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one my</font>

375
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,440
answer is the organizational culture

376
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:39,350
stinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the computing is just a</font>

377
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,390
reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizational view</font>

378
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,760
that's a truism as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as anything else</font>

379
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a reality there and so our</font>

380
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,830
picture of computers in computing is

381
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,880
articulated through our world<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

382
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,409
everyone else is articulated through

383
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,480
theirs and so it's going to put pressure

384
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">on organizational models and that</font>

385
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,410
familiarity and reality comment and

386
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,789
where and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we put forward those</font>

387
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,919
supporting narratives alternative

388

narratives in this space that human

389
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
component because it takes that

390
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,130
interdisciplinary model and then

391
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,750
interdisciplinary<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

393
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,130
topic justice here and I take all kinds

394
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,570
of welcome all kinds of feedback on how

395
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:25,210
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this forward but it was my</font>

396

intent to really make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that I</font>

did my best you value your input<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

398
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,280
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoyed listening to it over</font>

399
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,740
the last couple of days and hope this

400

that before word a perspective of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it</font>

all came together
