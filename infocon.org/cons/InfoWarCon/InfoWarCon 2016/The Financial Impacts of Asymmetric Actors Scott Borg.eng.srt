<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff about detecting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are enormous range of other</font>

so a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago at RS a</font>

my colleague John Bumgarner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concentrating on stopping</font>

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,330
tried to brainstorm everything we've

150
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,889
go this is a draft version and I'm

151
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,839
hoping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people here will</font>

152
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,229
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell us things we've</font>

153
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:38,469
missed as soon as we we circulated it to

154

people a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don capelli in</font>

155
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,279

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we thought oh my god how could we</font>

157
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,659
miss that I mean we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so</font>

158
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,520
stupid for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> you left them out you'll</font>

159
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,930
probably come up with a bunch of others

160
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,818
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make me read fast with</font>

161
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,919
embarrassment and you might find ways

162
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,689
where we've screwed up so so please give

163
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,409
me feedback in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime it's a very</font>

practical tool

165
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,320
that didn't sound ambitious enough now I

166
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,210
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to back up and look at what's</font>

happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world globally and</font>

quickly draw back and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what I</font>

based on

large collections of physical equipment

typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> steel equipment if you</font>

corporation your power your Europe your

wealth depended on massive massive

shipyards blast furnaces things that

242
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,000
required enormous investment and a very

were made of steel

245
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,450
your view that's that was those things

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">work where you how you created value and</font>

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,620
because the main way to increase

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,080
efficiency to increase productivity in

249
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,440
that year was economies of scale these

250
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,510
were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale things and because</font>

have more leverage more bargaining power

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,750
was concentration of power concentration

highly centralized

256
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,280
so we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these big companies that</font>

257
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,709
own these this massive physical stuff

00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've then got countries whose power</font>

259
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,000
rests on the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing countries were</font>

of of physical equipment corporation

263
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,780
didn't have to worry about competitors

264
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,790
unless those competitors also<font color="#CCCCCC"> had blast</font>

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,880
furnaces and<font color="#E5E5E5"> giant factories and that</font>

266
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,270
kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> railway enormous networks</font>

267
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,410
of metal railway lines of things

268
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,319
countries didn't have to worry about

269
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,839
about rival<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries competitors unless</font>

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,400
those countries had fleets of big ships

and masses of airplanes and other piles

of stuff

273
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,390
so that engendered an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

symmetrical conflict symmetrical

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,339
that was obvious and always the case all

00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,319
through history you can read through

an asymmetric conflict asymmetric

have an army if they weren't powerful

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,410
enough they didn't have masses of

293

often disciplined disciplined manpower

294

they then would engage in<font color="#E5E5E5"> guerrilla</font>

295
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,480

a list of companies even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that</font>

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,920
value of an automobile was in the

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,790
physical resources the energy the

the physical part of the automobile that

plastic and stuff all that other stuff

00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,709
that's probably only about a thousand

<font color="#E5E5E5">the value of that automobiles in the</font>

352
00:14:53,779 --> 00:15:00,019
information so even even these these

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,179
these companies that appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be still</font>

354
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:05,389
industrial they're not there they've

been transformed into<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else so</font>

356
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,399
now we're in a world where this

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,970
expectation of symmetry and talking

about asymmetry and asymmetric

<font color="#E5E5E5">Industrial Age debris that we now need</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this expectation of symmetry</font>

364
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:36,360
so what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see when we look at the</font>

365
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:39,569
world what's out there what's doing

366
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,640
everything now if we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into</font>

367
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations and people and we start</font>

368
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,210
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how we can model them we can</font>

369
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,680
start relatively broadly looking at

370
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,680
networks of relationships

371
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,420
we can start connecting people and

372
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations and mapping out their</font>

their their relationships and their

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,210
interactions

375
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,360
and as we do this we've been to see how

376
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,910
much these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things these all these these</font>

377

entities all those organizations that we

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,250
they've been transformed by information

<font color="#E5E5E5">technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font>

381
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,030
been transformed into is something I

don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good name for but I'm</font>

here to bees and how bees function these

our<font color="#CCCCCC"> forms that can be deeply divided</font>

398

into two categories we can talk about

collaborative swarms and associative

400
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,890
storms collaborative swarms are swarms

401
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,480
where there's a one-way flow of goods or

of all with these collaborative swarms

more specifically on kinship networks

617
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:05,130
and quite specifically often tribes and

618
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:07,710
even clans and families

619
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,170
that's what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on there it's not</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not countries anymore and nobody</font>

625
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,668
so we got corporations that rival

nation-states we've got ethnic swarms

627

that can you know run roughshod over

628
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,860
nation-states and destroy them we've got

629

this tradition

when people talk about geopolitics they

669
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,200
almost always are assuming this model of

the world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tip-off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Geo so this</font>

categories that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get beyond</font>

673
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,380
has for kind of main principles or

674
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,300
assumptions that sound at first<font color="#E5E5E5"> glance</font>

675
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,330
really reasonable they assume that the

676
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,889
main players in global and this is not

677
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,780
just international relations as such as

678
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,850
a strategic studies this is what's

679
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,350
directing all our military planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

680
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,939
is this is the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have been</font>

681
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the world coming out of the</font>

682
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,930
industrial age so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first assumption</font>

683
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,870
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main players are</font>

684
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation-states the second assumption is</font>

685
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,739
that nation-states will behave like

686
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,770
individual rational humans that they

687
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,820
have the equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a king or a</font>

688
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,620
president who can speak for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

689
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-state negotiated on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its behalf</font>

690
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:07,719
and so on the third assumption is that

691
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:12,340
power is founded on geography your power

692
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,020
depends on what resources population

693
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,050
ideally disciplined worker population

694
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,820
and what masses of equipment of

695
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,560
industrial equipment are within your

696
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,629
geographical area and it's assumed that

697
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,250
power ultimately is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be military</font>

698
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,320
when it comes to the crunch what will

699
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,110
decide things will be military power and

700
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,220
military power again seen as masses of

701
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,219
things build of<font color="#CCCCCC"> steel</font>

702
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,210
through those who look at where we are

703
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,390
with each of those given the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

704
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,850
just described assumption is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation</font>

players I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I just described</font>

707
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,180
all the problems we worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the</font>

708
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">world except in a long term maybe China</font>

709
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,380

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,919
forth across borders and they have no

736
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,889
way of keeping track of it people can

737
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,480
utilize information to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

738
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,160
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> borders and shift things</font>

739
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,440
around and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what's</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on no countries don't have borders</font>

that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> control any more countries</font>

742
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,470
have lost control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their own citizenry</font>

743
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,570
they used to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to control their</font>

744
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,250
interactions with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the world</font>

745
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,990
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they issued a limited number of</font>

746
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,030

<font color="#E5E5E5">and so on if people are interacting</font>

749
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:36,490
you know governments can't control this

750
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,500
second point here oh and consequences of

751
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,960
the assumption that it's venison

752
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-states but they're the main</font>

755
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,090
to all these other groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:58,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like empowered network</font>

network that ethnic ethnic swarms and

758
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,129
when bad things happen people want to

759
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,020
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that by going back to dealing</font>

dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network swarm they</font>

762
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,350
start a diplomatic initiative or they

763
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,050
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a country we can invade and</font>

764
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">declare war against and they they look</font>

765
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,669
at at nation-state activity they look at

766
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,980
what the secret plan of a nation-state

767
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:23,470
might be they assume that cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font>

768
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,570
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning with solar sunrise</font>

769
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,220
they regularly been assuming that cyber

770
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,730
attacks our nation state when they're

771
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,100
not one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big banks that I thought</font>

772
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,220
I know a lot about when they were

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,290
attacked by Russian organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> crime</font>

774
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively recently whatever that last</font>

775
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,870
wave was last spring the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

776
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,610
they'd hired coming out of a military

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and government background immediately</font>

778
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,449
thought nation-state it's got to be

779
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,750
Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> government and so on if that's</font>

780
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:54,610
coming after us and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

781
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that nations are the main players</font>

782
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,379
is causing real arm and

783
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,330
misunderstandings and keeping people

784
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,220
from looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's really going on</font>

785
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,730
and who the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real players are in the</font>

786
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,790
world so the second assumption is that

787
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,410
you can negotiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the diesel vaya</font>

their national self-interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

792
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,490
they're pursuing and you can you can

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,530
make binding trees with them and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

they're going to act in their national

796
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,060
self-interest people talk about this

797
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,740
still in a lot of our publications that

798
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,720
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things as well well of</font>

799
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the national self-interest is and</font>

800
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,900
that's what's running things and given

801

<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already been telling you</font>

802
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,660
clearly it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a country is</font>

803
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:50,450
functioning as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a swarm when we may have</font>

804
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,760
not model nations we now are we now have

805
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,100
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very loose week swarms</font>

806
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,070
that we can call national swarms and at

807
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,780
best central governments are herders of

808
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,870
swarms and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about as much</font>

809
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:06,100
success hurting swarms as that<font color="#CCCCCC"> praise</font>

810
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:08,149
would see would imply some very

811
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,009
controlling governments can heard their

812
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,020
swarms pretty well the way with the way

813
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,520
Russia and China can't but there are

814
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">many cases where there's forms are</font>

getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their control otherwise</font>

816
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,830
their economies wouldn't be doing

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:21,879
strange things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

central government's want

00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:29,210
the assumption that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries can be</font>

820
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:32,030
dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kings is it were like</font>

you know single voices once<font color="#CCCCCC"> again is</font>

causing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of very silly policies</font>

823
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,679
as far as international relations are

824
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,990
concerned and<font color="#E5E5E5"> military is concerned and</font>

825
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,929
you can you can probably quickly deduce

826
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:47,799
what some of those are moving along<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

827
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:51,699
the third assumption is that power is

828
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,700
primarily based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on geography</font>

829
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:59,130
that the big masses of equipment and

ruined and nach and and resources and

disciplined workers that you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

832
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,348
your geographical area was your power

base and that that was what what gave

<font color="#E5E5E5">you military power any other power</font>

835
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,109
well if you look at the modern economy

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:15,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have really powerful countries that</font>

00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:01,460
do you can design<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product and not even</font>

881
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:03,859
know until you're ready to manufacture

882
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,720
what you're going to make it up you can

883
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:09,200
decide whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be plastic</font>

884
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,609
or composite or ceramic or metal after

885
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,129
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your designing</font>

886
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,950
so we've got we've got companies that

887
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,960
are planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and building their power</font>

888
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,700
and operating and geography is mostly

889
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,310
just irrelevant we've got countries that

890
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,330
are major powers<font color="#E5E5E5"> where geography is not</font>

891
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:29,630
relevant so back when gia back when you

892
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,279
geography was your main<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of power</font>

893
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,160
the logical thing for countries to do

894
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,470
was try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand try to try to grab</font>

895
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,180
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of geography try to move their</font>

896
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,669
borders this is still what was happening

897
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,460
during world war two was happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

898
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,660
some degree afterwards throughout the

899
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,160
Cold War it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good way of modeling</font>

900
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,810
all these all these industrial things

901
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,790
I'm saying are obsolete by the way we're

902
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,410
all valid and true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and good ways of</font>

903
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,120
understanding what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening on in</font>

904
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,490
the industrial age<font color="#E5E5E5"> and including the</font>

905
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,350

906
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,839
were expanding their borders i remembers

907
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,430
the kids seeing propaganda educational

908
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,470
movies in school showing the onward

909

march of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communists you know Iron</font>

Curtain expanding and expanding because

911
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:16,710
it was in the modern<font color="#CCCCCC"> information economy</font>

912
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,750
what good would it do you to annex in

913
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,150
most cases unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're indexing people</font>

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,250
of your own ethnicity like in Crimea who

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,170
have a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of education and background</font>

916
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:28,200
that will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

917
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,150

926
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,930
into your workforce the way you could in

927
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,750
the industrial age the resources that

explicitly whenever it's going to

on in terms of maps geographical maps

in the information age and geographical

982
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,369
maps they print maps showing you know

983
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,650
networks and things and they think

984

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's going to make sense of it</font>

all the other stuff I'm talking about

the ethnic swarms the swarm activity the

don't fit in borders they don't fit in

990
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,010
particular areas and they're often

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,680
concentrated in tiny geographical areas

992
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:18,279
like like southern Sweden like like like

the Netherlands like Singapore if you're

you're taking a kind of geography it's

00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,160
not going to look that way anymore

997
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,750
things that look very small

998
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,700
geographically are going to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

999
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,260
places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> their oceans dividing</font>

a budding each other it's

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,649
and once again these assumptions have

caused you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your if</font>

you think the world can be understood in

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,230
geography and you look to you talk about

1006
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:45,119
global politics and you look at a map to

1007
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,250
figure out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an empowered</font>

1010
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,299
your actions are going to mostly be

1011
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,940
stupid if you think that military power

1012
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:58,890
is where it's at then when something bad

1013

a few problems

00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,910
what this new model looks like so I've

1070
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,619
already outlined some of the basics of

properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for 60 to figure</font>

out what replaces it properly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,000
to actually start applying a

sociological theory we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking now</font>

once we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dealing with</font>

1079
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:41,770
things like like empowered ethnic swarms

1080
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,060
sociology and actually anthropology

1081
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,009
become really central to understanding

1082
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,540
what's going on globally to

1083
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,960
understanding what's going on in the

1084
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,450
global economy but sociology as it

1085
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,140
currently exists is just as industrial

1086

age as as international relations the

misunderstandings of Nietzsche are due

1125
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,330
to extravagant statements he's making

00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:54,560
trying to get people's attention trying

something else here that might be useful

to say and that is to quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to</font>

but to just quickly identify some of the

1141
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:31,040
things to watch out for so one of the

1142

1204

capital is not important the way it

00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:53,348
organizes production is what's important

1206
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:56,770
anyway we got any time left<font color="#CCCCCC"> em five five</font>

more minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you're not so if</font>

1208
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,540
you're not driven to wanting to grab a

<font color="#CCCCCC">course is idle for me yes survival but</font>

1212

the way to understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is through</font>

the swarm models and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> global the</font>

models not to look at nation states and

1216
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:35,230
access is bitter predicted by swarm

1217
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:37,359
connections than by borders China in

1218
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,890
Africa being a wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> example for</font>

1219
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,740
talking about natural resources right

1220
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:43,029
now who would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have thought China has</font>

1221
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,160
been buying up all the natural resources

1222
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,320
in Africa but arguably that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mold</font>

1223
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,170
mercantilist model or simply imposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1224
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,849
your company the difference is from

1225
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:54,130
earlier globalization is earlier

1226
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:56,560
globalization was purely about natural

1227
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,420
resources and and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1228
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,400
commodities basically it was about

1229
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,200
things that you could exchange without a

1230
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,270
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collaboration modern</font>

1231
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,810
globalization is about rich exchanges of

1232
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:09,700
information and really dense

1233
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,720
collaborative collaborations well

1234
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,629
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not good that how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1235
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,189
current yeah you structure in Africa IDs

1236
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,720
yeah it's any word other than the old

1237
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,760
one it's extractive that's why they're

1238
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,230
mining in Afghanistan that's why they're

1239
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,970
so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about that afterwards I</font>

1240
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,680
used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that now I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

1241
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,810
at what they're actually doing and I

1242
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,830
would and what think what they're doing

1243
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:32,529
is is is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not that but but if</font>

1244
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:34,420
I'm wrong it's an anomaly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the modern</font>

1245
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,990
world so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> say quickly something</font>

1246
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">about markets in an Enlightenment market</font>

00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:11,220
was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inventors of its</font>

00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,680
cooperative game theory Valley creation

1309
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,919
stuff you've heard about value nets and

1310
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,169
value chains an added value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1311
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">complementary and so on most of that</font>

1312
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that theory those concepts were</font>

1313
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:27,269
produced by Adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> brandenburger and</font>

1314
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,180
heartburn Stewart and as far as

1315
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:31,799
information was concerned me in the

1316
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,440
mid-90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Harvard Business School</font>

1317
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:36,538
and that stuff caught on so fast that

1318
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,900
while we were teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the consulting</font>

1319
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,160
companies were already trying to sell it

1320
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,980
there's so there's this whole different

1321
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,779
way of looking at economics that

1322
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:48,599
replaces the Enlightenment way that

1323
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:51,390
really illuminates what's going on in

1324
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:53,309
globalization now I've probably

1325
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,700
definitely used up my time thank you

1326
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:55,700
very much
