<font color="#E5E5E5">okay win thanks for having us here there</font>

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,369
is actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people here since I</font>

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing another presentation</font>

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,399
be your lunch since you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be at</font>

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,620
lunch very shortly so today the topic

7
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,840
that obviously I wanted to present is

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,269
about a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit quick update on the</font>

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,950
Middle East cyber wars I think this is

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the third edition or maybe fourth</font>

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,280
edition of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic so we will try to</font>

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,790
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a most effective and</font>

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,890
fastest way possible the next screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,780
see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a disclaimer saying that</font>

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,400
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with an</font>

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,739
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to do some</font>

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,390
business with so I have to write

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that so please ignore</font>

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,360
that part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not promoting any I</font>

20
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:07,130
here and obviously will not be

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,420
discussing so the most important part is

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few screens so you should be</font>

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to see now 216 you see that screen</font>

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:22,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this year actually started</font>

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,479
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very interesting way because as you</font>

26
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:29,690
can see the Middle East cyber war was

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,479
actually kind of get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kick-started as</font>

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,630
well so the Nile or<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed denial</font>

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,570
of service was launched against the BBC

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,399
from the Middle East as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> from of</font>

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,429
their servers and their website were not

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">available for a period of time so it's</font>

33
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,720
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I like that even organizations</font>

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,140
that are in the West are basically being

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,210
easily and quite greatly affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,810
ongoing disputes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle East as</font>

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,490
well now there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific website that</font>

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,890
maybe some of the other presenters may

39
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,679
be referring to since they tend to

40
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,659
collect a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of statistics about the</font>

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of attacks the source of the</font>

42
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,200
attacks and the qualification of these

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the statistics</font>

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,220
over the last two years there's

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously continues to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:21,620
of change over 2014 versus 2015 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

47
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:24,200
see obviously cyber warfare slowly

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,050
playing an important role as the attacks

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,119
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more forward so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

50
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,650
you'll realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite</font>

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,370
important i'll try to highlight it in a

52
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,800
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upcoming screens as well I</font>

53
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,510
guess key players in this new war

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,080
obviously we have the United States

55
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,239
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key ally of some of the key</font>

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,430
countries in the region so they have to

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pay attention obviously some of</font>

58
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,970
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> players and one of the key</font>

59
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,079
players today in the region is somebody

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,710
known as Isis or dash so after somehow

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,490
ignoring Isis for a long period of time

62
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,540
although they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been doing</font>

63
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">something on the ground they're</font>

64
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,290
certainly not doing anything

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,410
electronically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pentagon actually</font>

66
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,660
officially<font color="#E5E5E5"> launched some press</font>

67
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,400
conference in which they said oh we're

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,290
actually going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after thatch after</font>

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,810
some time there was a lot of cheer the

70
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,489
process what the interesting aspect is

71
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,070
that initially the Pentagon may have a

72
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,350
lot of resources behind them but

73
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,030
incorrectly realize that maybe they were

74
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the best qualified people to</font>

75
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,320
actually launch this initial set of

76
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,390
attacks for the simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason they may</font>

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,340
not have as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much knowledge as other</font>

78
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,079
people in the region have or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">more distributed organization like</font>

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
anonymous so something like anonymous

81
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,820
was able to actually inflict some

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,350
initial damage on Isis by launching<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,690
simple attacks the acquaintance<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

84
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,060
face some of the key pages of Isis and

85
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,760
they replace them with the famous feel

86
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,660
that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about famous blue pill</font>

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,120
so in which they actually advertised

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:00,630
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of recruiting for clinical</font>

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,770
action work in promoting this now

90
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,980
interesting at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time as Pentagon</font>

91
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,020
was announcing this wash against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dash</font>

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,299
and cyber war there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a press</font>

release that God announced but you

94
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,169
quickly realized it it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

appeared on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CENTCOM twitter feed</font>

it's not clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether there is any</font>

serious security threat the White House

118
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,490
says they're looking into the hack but

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,139
the timing was quite embarrassing

120
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">President Obama spoke about protecting</font>

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,710
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter account and a YouTube</font>

126

channel and that not a large data breach

127
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,239
and that it was more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a PR attack by</font>

128
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,090
Isis rather than a technical one but

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">again the timing and speaking of timing</font>

obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the key countries in the</font>

146
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:16,460
region<font color="#E5E5E5"> including United Arab Emirates</font>

147
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:18,860
Saudi Arabia oman and qatar have been

148
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,020
obviously leading the protection against

149
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,490
this critical infrastructure all of

150
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,349
these four countries have actually

151
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,460
created critical infrastructure

152
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:30,560
protection and as a result of that they

153
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,590
are started the process of initiating

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,039
defense mechanisms again that critical

<font color="#E5E5E5">the press in the last few days there's</font>

159
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,299
although this conflict is creating real

over

163
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,920
on the electronic front as well I think

164
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,020
one of the important aspects that is

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,660
twiligh lighting is in this year there

166
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,580
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been quite a large number of data</font>

167
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,730
leaks as a result and there are some

168
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,530
examples of these data leaks one of them

169
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,250
is obviously affecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> turkey we're</font>

170
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,690
about fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the national ID</font>

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,890
the country got leaked online so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

173
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,720
quickly imagine the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of impacts the</font>

177
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,370
is a result of this leaked online if

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,380
you're looking about leaks I think

179
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,350
Middle East is also being affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

180
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,420
the famous Panama papers leaks if you

181
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,180
compare this obviously to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slow leak</font>

182
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,400
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago where one point seven</font>

183
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,700
gigabytes of information got leaked

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,250
online the Panama papers leak 2.6

185
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,010
terabytes of data including vital

186
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,900
information it leads to some of the key

187
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,930
leaders in the area<font color="#CCCCCC"> now some leaders in</font>

188
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,429
Europe already had to somehow resign

189
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,640
their posts to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it will be</font>

190
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,410
the results of the impact of those leaks

191
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,960
now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look this in terms of</font>

192
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,970
percentage of population to present your

193
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,669
revenue you quickly see a lot of

194
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,430
countries in the area like Emirates UAE

195
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,920
and others are basically being a quite

196
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,190
substantial by the size of those leaks

197
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,500
so as a result it would be worthwhile

198
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,040
watching what is the impact of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over</font>

199
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,880
the next few months many of us actually

200
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,880
remember a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Stuxnet obviously</font>

201

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,620
it was a program<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lasted something</font>

203
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,209
five to seven years actually took three

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,750
to four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has actually</font>

enough to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> launch app on the</font>

some time before Google is able to

Taliban groups had created their own

about cyber war and specifically about

today actually lifting gates that would

in one of the drones of the United

sophisticated attacks can be launched

310
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:16,290
against these devices in creature as you

this information is simply available by

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,530
googling it online or at least being

able to google<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the correct way</font>

334
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,339
there's very advanced courses that will

actually teach you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do this in a</font>

necessarily uses effective mechanisms to

defend themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sometimes they</font>

342
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,450
resort to very basic methods and one

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,220
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Egypt Egypt may not have the</font>

sophisticated monitoring against their

users in the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they simply</font>

347
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,489
decide to block the service and

was a telecommunication industry in the

355
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,970
Middle East we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about attacks</font>

356
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,030
that are 300 gigabits per second so

357
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,730
quite important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of size I think</font>

358
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,319
this year we're seeing attacks that are

359
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,750
neighboring about six hundred gigabytes

360
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,210

361
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,670
that is required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect against</font>

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:29,730
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> against these attacks needs to</font>

363
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,680
be much more sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font>

actually simply shut down their systems

sometimes you lunch a boomerang but that

interviews selection criteria in order

416
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,100
methods also got completely revealed

online as well one<font color="#E5E5E5"> area that obviously</font>

we have neglected in terms of protecting

up and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we are using social media</font>

425
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,679
proactively so they ended up shutting

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,080
down about 125,000 Twitter accounts but

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:50,480
when is that organizations like g<font color="#CCCCCC"> c HQ</font>

440
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,210
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from UK are spending</font>

441
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,340
substantial amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars or pounds</font>

442
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,770
in this case about protecting your

443
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,669
critical infrastructure they realized it

444
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,830
this investment is not allowed them to

445
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:07,400
defend themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> as effectively as they</font>

446
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,290
wished so really are we spending money

447
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,750
correctly to defend ourselves against

448
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,080
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call a symmetrical attacks let</font>

449
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,720
me take this problem one level further

450
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,300
the kind of communication systems that

451
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. they uses on the field is</font>

452
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,220
rigged with vulnerabilities so that

453
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,350
means the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same way today Palestine and</font>

454
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,230
others can spy on the drones lunch by

455
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,050
Israel attackers can spy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

456
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,179
telecommunication systems by using US

457
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:38,090
and its allies on the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font>

458
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,130
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that even the basic level</font>

459
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,159
of protection have not actually taken

460
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:45,290
place obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this area it is</font>

461
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,670
important to understand and classify all

462
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,190
the elements of critical infrastructure

463
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,300
I named a few but things like

464
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,500
transportation banking telecom water

465
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,230
desalination for some of you take a city

466
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,540
like Riyadh today which is about Samuel

467
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I six to seven million other dudes all</font>

468
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,220
the water comes from eastern province

469
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,928
from the mom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is dominated water so</font>

470
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">if somebody was to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack the</font>

471
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,090
desalination plant electronically and

472
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,100
shut down water to react within three to

473
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,199
four days<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that city will</font>

474
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,409
become

475
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,410
a beautiful city yes

476
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:36,909
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saudi has created a new department</font>

477
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,799
by added by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Ministry of Interior</font>

478
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,010
they actually moved one of the doctors I

479
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,059
can send you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of this doctor</font>

480
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually protect critical</font>

481
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:50,020
infrastructure and they have initiated

482
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,610
some programs to basically monitor the

483
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,250
attacks that created a national

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,678
encryption algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and others so they</font>

485
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,309
are well underway but you can say these

486
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

you

494

ok

495
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:05,549
we continue or repulsed

496
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,120
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect so there's three more</font>

497
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:10,408
slides and we'll wrap it up so obviously

498
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,760
organizations our country that today for

499
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,399
example do not necessarily have the same

500
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">advanced capabilities they have the</font>

501
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,899
capacity to very quickly launch the kids

502
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,639
to get it attacks because they can hire

503
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,260
the mercenaries to actually launch the

504
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,320
cyber attacks as you know today you can

505
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,629
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy exploits online anywhere from</font>

508
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,460
important is to realize the pecking

509
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,500
order in the area obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is allies</font>

510
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,419
as well as Israel are on the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

511
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,880
scale in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending and</font>

512
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,730
capabilities in cyber war turkey is not

513
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,860
much far behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but Iran is playing a</font>

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,889
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> role then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind that we have</font>

516
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:57,178
necessarily in that order as you can see

517
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:59,940
Saudi Arabia today spending a very big

518
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,039
deal of their national budget on

519
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,620
security and what they're spending on

520
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,870
the normal war on the ground there

521
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:10,500
obviously spending the equivalent almost

522
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:12,000
online as well now the important aspect

523
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,539
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to alight about these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sip</font>

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,669
symmetry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacks is that today</font>

525
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:20,669
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you see the hacker you</font>

see it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to defend you or I</font>

528
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,080
launch an attack against you in the

529
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,639
future I still think<font color="#CCCCCC"> most organizations</font>

530
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,580
especially in the Middle East I have a

531
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:34,229
lot of work to do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area of testing</font>

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">their agility against cyber attacks and</font>

533
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously the shamu</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and by the way the impacts of shamu on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Saudi Aramco and raz gas exist to this</font>

537
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,549
day let me give you an idea some systems

538
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,769
and Saudi Aramco continue to be

539
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,779
disconnected from<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and presumably</font>

540
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,159
a system and engineering and x-pac and

541
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,889
no spots are not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

542
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,700
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fears the future attacks as</font>

543
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:06,090
well in quick lessons learned to wrap up

544
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,950
my presentation everybody is working on

545
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,139
building up capacity especially the

546
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,840
clients and the organizations in the

area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have the capability to do so</font>

548
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,189
is obviously involved organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

549
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,210
Saudi Arabia<font color="#E5E5E5"> or country you</font>

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:23,940
Qatar Oman a symmetry plays obviously

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,070
very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> role in the area social</font>

553
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,710
matter because they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

554

556
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,990
be addressed in more detail and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

557
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,750
more focus needs to be put on critical

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,880
infrastructure and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> involves the 10</font>

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,280
or 12 elements of critical

560

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,840
vulnerabilities people are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

574
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,139
about drones and others and it means

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are not being properly tested and</font>

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,540
they are not improperly rolled out into

577
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:48,990
the field so if there they have very

578
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,240
basic vulnerabilities today the

579
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,980
adversaries are smart guides and they

580
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,470
can quickly take advantage of these

winner abilities to their advantage very

582

583
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,400
happening on drones where today for

584
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,190
example there's different variation that

585
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,170
drones are being sold with different

586
