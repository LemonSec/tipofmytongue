<font color="#E5E5E5">changed to a degree but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is still</font>

and ultimately it's directed by humans

at least for now lr rot<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arrives</font>

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,750
but robot overlords right and Colin will

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,260
be seeking to accelerate that timeline

10
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:19,110
in his presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> but so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font>

11
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that mean it means that there are</font>

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:26,230
physical analogues to cyberspace

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,929
activities are they perfect one for one

experience elsewhere and learn from it

17
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,940
and apply it into cyberspace activities

18
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,410
again so what

19
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so what we have now is a</font>

25
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,109
we'll use society as people who are on

cyberspace people you suck and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

messy the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is state of being</font>

58

that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,770
definition but if you take the norms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

64
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,460
cyberspace behavior what is generally

<font color="#E5E5E5">accepted as that official majority of</font>

who are seeking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> overturn those norms</font>

and seeking to compete act as insurgents

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to get into a more</font>

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,870
doctrinal definition of insurgency joint

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,430
doctrine defines it as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurgency as</font>

72
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,020
an organized movement aimed at the

overthrow of a constituted government

74
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,200
through the use of conversion and armed

increasing insurgent control

83
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,950
so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a situation where we lack</font>

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,780
that central government situation we

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,180
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple nation states which have</font>

varying degrees that yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West</font>

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,750
failure model does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not translate</font>

88
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:50,250
perfectly into cyberspace but it does

89
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:54,110
have impact but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we I think we can come</font>

90
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very loose wide accommodating</font>

91

concept of what fiber spaces for most

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,349
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how they want to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

93
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,419
that there definitely are those out

there who are looking to overthrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

model

96
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,370
so

97
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:13,780
from there

98
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,120
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do about that so</font>

99
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,440
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an insurgency you conduct</font>

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,440
the counterinsurgency

101
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,620
coin was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word of the of the day a</font>

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,570
few years back of how to conduct a

103
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,510
counterinsurgency if a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use</font>

104
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:36,030
because honestly because counter

105
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:38,820
insurgency is grinding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee boring not</font>

106
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,580
sexy at all does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not give itself over to</font>

107
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,490
bumper stickers and send<font color="#CCCCCC"> mottos it's a</font>

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:49,010
lot of hard work and there's no one

109
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">agency that can pull it off though</font>

110
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,290
a comprehensive civilian and military

111
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,400
efforts taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to defeat nents and</font>

112
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,970
insurgency<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to address core</font>

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,969
grievances

114
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,400
therefore an effective strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,560
with savage insurgency must transcend

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,500
simple law enforcement due to the

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,820
limited scope and resources of law

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,040
enforcement and also

119
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,140
transcends the because of its

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,290
transnational nature transcends the

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,490
powers of federal government you need

122
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">both yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use either only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no but more</font>

123
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:34,080
importantly you need the denizens<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">space the citizens of cyberspace to be</font>

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,450
willing participants in helping in this

126
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:42,539
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter insurgency all of these</font>

127
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to come together so that makes it</font>

128
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,800
the wicked problem how do you coordinate

129
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,660
all these efforts how do you give them

130
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,930
some direction when you can't put out a

131
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">bumper sticker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> llego team it</font>

132
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,170
happened it has to be very nuanced has

133
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,719
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tailored how do we pull this off</font>

134
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,060
so not yet

135
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,649
who said I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's it's a tough</font>

136
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,649
problem can it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done yes</font>

137
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,319
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the main issues that any kind</font>

138
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">of insurgency runs into is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad</font>

139
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,730
guys will do bad things

140
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,280
and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons they do these bad</font>

141
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,880
things is to cause a reaction from

142
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,829
whatever force they wish to react

143
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,540
whether it's a government a police force

144
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:37,750
a corporation another organization they

145
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,199
will elicit a response and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

146
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:44,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that response is to cause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damage to the</font>

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,790
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're hiding amongst</font>

148
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,380
so in a physical environment a terrorist

149
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,439
will make an action<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an attempt to</font>

150
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,090
cause an excessive police or military

151
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,670
reaction which then is oppressive to the

152
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">population which causes a negative</font>

155
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,200
but they're eliciting excessive response

156
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,579
has to be avoided same thing happens in

157
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,730
cyberspace you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

160
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,399
corporation will have an excessive

161
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,399
response and how to

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,300
after that that is part of their idea

163
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:35,339
that's their plan is to cause that

164
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:41,959
excessive reaction so you so the minimum

165
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,959
force maximum effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> dictate isn't is he</font>

166
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,890
and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the catch-22 of</font>

167
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,080
insurgency and terrorism that if you

168
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,550
react strongly then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're playing into</font>

169
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,130
their hands if you don't react at all

170
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:57,920
your seat is impotent you have to be

171
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">very careful but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effective</font>

172
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,500
um

173
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,519
the inherent asymmetry of weave I won't

174
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,899
get too much into it because people

175
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,100
people earlier talked about the

176
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,959
asymmetry and I think they covered it

177
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,959
rather well so I'll skip look at that

178
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,010
asymmetry is inherent<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to an</font>

179
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:22,690
insurgency because nobody attacks the

180
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,310
strength you'll always go after a

181
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,279
weakness that is standard predatory

182
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,638
behavior so

183
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,740
it is by definition what's going to be

184
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,320
what's going to

185
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,600
ain't this entire picture is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">symmetry so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

187
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,890
can bother complaining about it is the

188
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,040
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that's the definition of</font>

189
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,040
it

190
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,100
so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly large body of work</font>

191
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,569
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to conduct insurgencies and</font>

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,800
counterinsurgencies in the physical

<font color="#E5E5E5">draw from some of those the strategy has</font>

strategic over you we are struggling

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think everybody's experience</font>

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,750
cnc I parts 12 and who knows what we're

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come up a part 3 at some point</font>

200
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,589
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have at least in the United</font>

202
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,690
cybersecurity strategy and when they do

203
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,790
talk about cybersecurity it is tends to

204
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,990
be widget focused same focus there is no

205
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,089
nobody's taking a look at it and say no

206
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,250
this is much bigger it includes all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,720
you all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topics everybody else's been</font>

counterinsurgency strategy a much

broader approach

211
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,779
so let's get

212
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,880
so part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the existing body of work on</font>

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,089
insurgency common insurgency the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

prior to that issuing out that book he

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,670

228
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,949
borrowing other people's ideas I've

229
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:58,280
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that as well so</font>

00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:00,860
these are 27 articles i<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed not as</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we can all agree point if you</font>

about it that these are all things that

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,210
would have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed at some point</font>

powdering it the cyber insurgency

239
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,680
Oh first diaper spirit is complexity

240
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,050
right you cannot do a Cartesian system

241
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,050
analysis

242
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,029
or just come up with one great widget to

243
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,709
solve this not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it it's its</font>

244
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,120
complexity you have to understand that

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to have to bring in other</font>

246

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of cyber is not a coherent</font>

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,709
effort right

249
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,530
the bad guys aren't one bad guy

250
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,120
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backs people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,000
things for different reasons you treat

252
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,540
them all the same then you run the risk

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,680
of driving people that are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge</font>

254
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,779
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> more extremist positions and so</font>

255
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,969
some kid wants to download is music

256
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,880
files and you come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> download them on</font>

257
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,819
a half with a huge hammer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

258
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,180
push it into more black opportunities

259
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:22,579
and and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more radical behavior you</font>

260
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,008
so treat if somebody's being a thief

261
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:28,040
treat them like a thief if somebody's

262

<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do extremists and radical and</font>

263
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,189
violent things then you treat them

264
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:35,209
accordingly but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat</font>

265
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:38,029
everybody the same figure out what the

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:41,060
different aspects are disaggregate that

267
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:43,430
that threat and treat the different

268
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,279
parts appropriately

269
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,140
make it harder to be bad this is

270
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,939
probably the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and least</font>

271
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,939
sexy aspect of the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

272
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,899
anything you can do to keep somebody if

273
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,070
you're becoming radicalized to keep

274
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,370
somebody if you're coming one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

275
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,970
insurgents is a win

276
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,250
so that's on the propaganda side the

277
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,370
messaging side it's on the Software

278
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,440
Assurance side it's on all those basic

279
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,500
coding principles if you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it harder</font>

things

okay it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be your only</font>

283
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,290
answer you're not going to be able to

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,240
patch your way out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this however if</font>

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,360
you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more difficult to do the</font>

287
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,370
break the cycle whatever cycle you want

288
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,710
to how'd it as the contagion infection

289
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,330
and spread if you want to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

or the crime monetization extrapolation

whatever model you want to use there's a

planning process and you need oh you

305
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,270
need a process that considers the

where you have multiple types of

operations you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one thing</font>

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:46,230
you you set the table right you've

you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control goes after that and</font>

314
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,270
you have follow-on operations that yeah

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,270
on that

316
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,879
go into the specific military speak on

that but I tried really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to avoid it</font>

um yeah disaggregate the threat that

braid it up going to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> along here</font>

there is no perfect metric there's no

use them but then work on better one

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult one in this space right</font>

418
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,130
since the it varies from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

but what aspect is so you'll have if

00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:11,470
you're good yet standard operating

436
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,690

lawyer

495
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm communicate up and down the chain

496
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,520
learn how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the bosses and give</font>

them what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> need not everything what</font>

498
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:02,100
they need and if your bosses are

499
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:05,889
differently what it's good if you have a

500
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,969
that threshold defined what do I call

501
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,810
you in the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night and wake</font>

502
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,960
you up for what what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what's that</font>

503
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:20,720
threshold when things go bad how bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

504
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:22,220
it before I call down the chain right

505
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,140
keep complaining about if you complain

506
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,730
about the users all the time make sure

507
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,000
the users know what you need need from

508
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,830
them and if something is going wrong let

509
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,620
them know why

510
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,620
yeah now make them part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team</font>

511
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,710
global society yeah

512
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:49,090
one little gripe everybody's gripe is

513
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,590
global map right so where you could get

514
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,870
away with a certain level of cultural

515
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,459
insensitivity 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

516
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,159
other culture would never see what you

517
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,020
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case anymore you have</font>

518
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,060
to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more aware I'm not</font>

519
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,450
saying paranoid and never do anything

520
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:08,169
and just sit on your thumbs but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

521
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,480
aware of where you are if you can keep a

contention you have

524
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,730
not you have saved yourself a lot more

525
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,730
worried down the line

526
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:29,759
don't just ditch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the westphalian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mop out</font>

527
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:33,980
of hand right not God yet and it's

528
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:39,809
worked for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things flavoring oh</font>

529
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:41,759
yeah it has had some benefits right and

530
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,639
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of power their nation</font>

531
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,730
states still have a fair amount of power

532
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:51,988
is it funky hard to adjust and

533
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,529
ham-handed most times yes however it's

534
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,529
not to be ignored

535
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,430
police<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus the army</font>

536
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:05,740
big difference

537
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:08,470
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental difference</font>

538
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:12,370
the police are of the people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

539
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:15,240
people or should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the army</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kills</font>

540
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,239
people and breaks things

541
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,350
it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> instrument of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blunt force</font>

542
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,770
yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about surgical strikes and</font>

543
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,080
we have gotten a lot better at it and

544
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:30,160
warfare today compared to warfare 30 40

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">50</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago is far more precise and you</font>

546
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,100
know fewer innocent lives are lost but

547
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,530
it is not a clean antiseptic thing the

548
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,379
army so when you start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

549
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:44,440
nation-state<font color="#CCCCCC"> stieber forces you're going</font>

550
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,980
to have a similar parallel where you

551
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:52,960
bring in big guns make things happen and

552
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:55,630
people don't tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like that over any</font>

553
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,600
experience send a period of time that's

554
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,990
why police is much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective at</font>

555
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,510
police functions don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use one</font>

556
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,450
for the other vice versa if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

557
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,940
big problem if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a nation state</font>

558
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,710
level problem please don't have the

559
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,560
resources to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so you have</font>

560
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,880
to bring in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big guns knowing what</font>

561
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,200
the two are know that there's a

562
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,220
difference and know that you need both

<font color="#E5E5E5">types of force</font>

564
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:27,070
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary hey were they yep</font>

565
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:31,360
as the policeman notes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font>

for the rules of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberwarfare cat food</font>

whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it or not there are</font>

rules for land warfare rules for sea

575
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,750
warfare even rules for space warfare but

576
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:03,889
those are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sketchy right and for</font>

577
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,890
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> part they're followed</font>

578
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:09,460
rules are there for a reason and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons</font>

580
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,270
we need that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cyber warfare there</font>

581
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,159
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some very abortive attempts so</font>

582
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,870
far we need to continue to do this and

583
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,330
this would help with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition for</font>

584
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the police</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what makes it an act of</font>

585
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,030
cyber warfare

586
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright this and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is more important</font>

587
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,080
i think more immediate than most people

588
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,700
think right then there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

589
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,330
number of exercises at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> national</font>

590
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:39,620
level where the exercise that is bad

591
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,649
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing stuff and the DoD rep sitting</font>

592
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,560
there glee

593
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,940
yeah what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to do a lot</font>

594
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they weren't going after a</font>

595
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:52,120
government targeting going after a

596
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,860
national industry going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after up where</font>

597
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,360
does it kick off what's the trip wire

598
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
that says this is now a national thing

599
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,399
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring the full weight and</font>

600
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,939
force of the Department of Defense

601
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Ministry of Defense or whichever bear on

602
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,250
this issue yes that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same program</font>

603
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,180
that's stunning<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying but the states</font>

604
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:17,380
would open seventy thousand dollars he

605
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:20,100
knew pretty sure they object East

606
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,100
European

607
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,230
a very efficient for fishing

608
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,280
I'm problem

609
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:39,890
I said nearly the first cyberwarfare a

610
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:39,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit plain tempted by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University open</font>

611
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,420
and fed a load of trash I'm the FBI said

612
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,250
well we can't touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because that's a</font>

613
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:52,090
really funny

614
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,990
that's the problem but already we do

615
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,919
have to redefine

616
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:59,150
because there are cyber spaces enabled

617
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,750
activities which nobody envisioned

618
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:05,059
before right in a physical world

619
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:09,050
stealing that data was completely

620
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">different and in a cyber event but this</font>

621
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,370
is one where the analog does not hold

622
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,780
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to redefine that's</font>

623
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,860
that's why I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate point there</font>

624
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:22,070
is it has to be redefined and then the

625
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,309
27th article is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> peels principles</font>

626
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,740
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cyber police and this is where I</font>

627
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:30,100
cheated because then I came up with the

628
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">next day</font>

629
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:36,030
you

630
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,040
um as I went over these again I was

631
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">embarrassed to see how few of these were</font>

632
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,960
actually followed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. police</font>

633
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,960
departments

634
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:51,960
but the main point of this the takeaway

635
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:56,129
is please have to be complete partners

636
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,680
with population if the police do not

637
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,410
have the confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the population</font>

638
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,910
not welcome the population they're not

639
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,910
very effective police

640
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,550
so how do we do this in cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

641
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:13,040
giving any ideas here more than willing

642
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,110
to listen but this is something that

643
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,600
we're going to we need to get up I do

644
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,850
with precluded from it because the

645
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,780
Chinese have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> death sentence that</font>

646
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:27,230
onstage forms of penn state sponsored

647
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:30,710
interesting Oh which precludes us in the

648
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:34,760
UK sharing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be subject to the</font>

649
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:36,230
death sentence prosecuting a life here

650
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,590
at the same mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the other</font>

651
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">bed signals if you were assuming they do</font>

652
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,780
the pursuer hacker in<font color="#CCCCCC"> spine our own</font>

653
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,240
grave basement

654
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,879
with that sentence you have come for

655
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,170
hectic does that give you a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

656
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,060
I don't know about the den sentence

657
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,810
aspect of it but I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there have</font>

658
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,990
been times where us police authorities

659
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,139
have tracked back to china in an attempt

660
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:07,179
to and not just at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> State Department</font>

661
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:10,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">level saying bad Chinese stop but actual</font>

662
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:16,150
lease organizations going back and

663
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,150
saying we need to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in China I</font>

664
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:25,040
don't like mistake they have a clearer

665
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,330
idea of jurisdiction over cyber crimes I

666
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,100
but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go any further</font>

667
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,090
under that because I oldness state wine

668
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:38,389
dessert but yeah they have two full

669
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:39,950
partners yes ma'am prevent crime in this

670
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,710
oh by the way I stole all these these

671
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,449
are not know these are my<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that's it</font>

672
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,699
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that at least currently in</font>

673
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,620
the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States that's a proactive</font>

674
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,750
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our law enforcement this is</font>

675
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:54,259
more of a reactive yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pyrah lee</font>

676
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,050
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind frame entirely different</font>

677
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,940
set of

678
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,230
things they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through in their</font>

679
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,690
training I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their training</font>

680
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,580
most other academies all focus on how do

681
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,010
we react to crime how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we investigate</font>

682
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,170
crime not how do we see what crime I to

683
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,080
cook how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we help those crime shows</font>

684
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,860
off yo stop those price pretty scary

685
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't it</font>

686
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,279
right

687
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:24,930
now probably 15 years even admin yeah

688
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we will we've got so far the</font>

689
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,509
wrong direction if Ferguson in other

690
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,480
places that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people finally be to go huh</font>

691
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:36,000
what about this if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some great</font>

692
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like population or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

693
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">oriented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controlling and like that that</font>

694
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:44,009
there is a lot of theory on how do no

695
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,270
work with you stuff like that so don't

696
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">let us say just straight off the bat</font>

697
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,079
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're only react if they are</font>

698
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,328
doing certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are proactive</font>

699
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,809
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean really have resources and</font>

700
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:56,549
then you know ruption is different in

701
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:59,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">different here doesn't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you take the</font>

702
00:35:56,549 --> 00:36:02,309
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so looks a rendition I think</font>

703
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,730
you even see this in media right think

704
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:09,150
back well hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> les can think back to</font>

705
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:11,760
the dragnet dance and Adam 12 and and

706
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,920
where the police weren't always in car

707
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,440
chases and gunfights where they weren't

708
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,809
always you know starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the body</font>

709
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,849
and what moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> backwards from there</font>

710
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:23,099
where you actually saw some<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventative</font>

711
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:25,589
pleasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle know if it was a</font>

712
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,920
Saudi religious but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good at</font>

713
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:31,558
keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> a population I'm see any visible</font>

714
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,230
evidence head<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your pet fish</font>

715
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,840
they're doing quite well

716
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously quite a bit you see the</font>

717
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,940
reaction among the population<font color="#CCCCCC"> to things</font>

718
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,100
like the driving bans with verizon uber

719
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,480
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will sing the saturday right</font>

720
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:50,640
here well I'll Kim it's over but what

721
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,770
you do see crime and disorder there

722
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
that's why they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the guys</font>

723
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:58,430
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

724
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,430
what is this place<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the smoke yeah</font>

725
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:01,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey yes sir</font>

726
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,339
52

727
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,210
realized immigrants these were

728
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:09,210
principles

729
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,290
