Kansas which is a question I get every

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,850
once awhile is that it has a laboratory

to give you tonight the second and that

33
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,620
is a one about sense and avoid and the

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,020
might be as many as 500 various attacks

00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,610
and required defenses on critical

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,979
infrastructure and we put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

qualitatively and quantitatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

market<font color="#E5E5E5"> now has changed I saw a statistic</font>

53
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,660
just moments ago well aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> my phone is</font>

the levels of our which we'll get to in

62
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,480
a minute the level of action the second

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,060
thing is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually</font>

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,100
register drones and where well it turns

<font color="#CCCCCC">out that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> statistic you heard just a</font>

moment ago the 21<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs. 400 in Kansas</font>

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,010
nobody wants to register their farmers

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,980
they couldn't give a damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

69
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,540
registering if you're in Philadelphia

70
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,179
trying to work the porn business or if

really good for drugs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are in</font>

now are doing a very good job of

76
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,230
registering their drones all of the ISIS

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,030
people here on our lands are not

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,929
registering drones and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

79
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,360
you what they're going to do with them

80
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,030
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will really not like what you</font>

gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you three areas please enjoy it it</font>

83
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,768
took six of us some long work and lots

84
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,430
of estimate the market for small UAVs

85
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,410
also the FAA which has hired us to take

86
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,630
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what regulations are needed</font>

87
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,019
they have an information security group

88
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,609
which sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah frankly it's not an</font>

89
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,940
information security group it's a coffee

90
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,940
klatch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been asked to help them</font>

91
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,799
with information secure them well they

92
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,870
really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to address this</font>

93
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,040
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their very best not to</font>

94
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,360
address security because it's hard and

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,840
they would rather have the judicial

96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,370
system take its place if the judicial

97
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,290
system will just give us a few decisions

98
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,750
will then tell you what the security

99
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,060
to be okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me give you a perfect</font>

100
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,029
example of that the Kentucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> case just</font>

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,880
recently to others this is where a drone

102
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:28,030
went over the house of a psychiatrist

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,520
and the psychiatrist said<font color="#E5E5E5"> your I have my</font>

104
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:34,239
clients come to my house<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright he</font>

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,280
lives in a gated to cure area they pays

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,160
for that security remember this for a

107
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so a drone comes over his house</font>

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,090
and he says I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want you I don't</font>

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,820
want anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know who my clients are</font>

110
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,638
he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to court and suit that was his</font>

111
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,729
first effort they said to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

you sign the contract for<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect you</font>

115
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,039
he says well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want my clients to</font>

116
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,849
be no because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in for psychiatric</font>

117
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:06,099
here and the answer came are they able

118
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to draw to drive directly into your</font>

garage and move from your garage certain

120
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,570
no they park on on the on the outskirt

121
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,229
of the house then anybody could see them

122
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,360
thrown a no Trump he lost the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right he doesn't stop there he shoots</font>

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,530
the damn drone down the next time you

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,130
you heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little earlier well the rule</font>

128
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,289
became interesting the judge at that

129
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,780
point had to go back nearly 70 years to

130
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:38,320
the only known drone case at the time

131
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said 83 feet above your house you</font>

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,419
won't anything below from 83 feet below

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,940
is your print you're protecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

134
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:49,270
property it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just until</font>

135
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,840
recently 500 feet was the top end of it

136
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,120
the FAA with its one few rule 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set</font>

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,810
of rules said 500 feet it's a felony

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,650
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're shooting down a plane got</font>

139
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,750
it so it's a wild wild west between 500

140
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,929
feet and 80 83 feet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

141
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,880
measure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you shoot the drum</font>

142
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so he shot it down with a</font>

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,500
shotgun it turns out that it was

144
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:17,860
somewhere according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people about</font>

145
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,690
70<font color="#CCCCCC"> feet so he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got away with this except</font>

146
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,030
he's liable for damages to the drone

147
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,029
it's a tort but he doesn't go to jail

148
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,669
because he didn't shoot down a plane

149
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:30,100
well that didn't stop our boy

150
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,280
the next thing he did was buy a c41

151
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,870
drone killer a drone killer which you

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,940
probably have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> we set up their</font>

153
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,610
shoots down it's basically an electrical

154
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,980
pulse of a radar energy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

155
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,520
strong it's about 10 kW but guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

156
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,890
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gun and because in the state</font>

157
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,109
he was in they had gun laws that are

158
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,659
oppressive and the Second Amendment

159
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,640
along with the fourth is under attack he

160
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,870
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention he said I did no</font>

161
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,370
harm to this property<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was you</font>

162
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,280
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at my daughter get he must</font>

163
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,390
have quite a door but looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at her all</font>

164
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">right the third case is most interesting</font>

165
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,570
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out several facts he didn't</font>

166
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,820
have a daughter the second thing is

167
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,099
william t gun is illegal in the state

168
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,730
but you see where it's going to go here

169
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,260
the third one is it was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 89 feet now</font>

170
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,090
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell they knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that between</font>

171
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,770
70-90 unless you have some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

172
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,359
measure this and i doubt<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he went up</font>

173
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">there took a ladder you know measured</font>

174
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,710
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but somehow using geometry</font>

175
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,110
they came up with 80 90 90 feet so now

176
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,370
he's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wild wild west but by using</font>

177
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:41,590
an unsanctioned gun he is now committed

178
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,830
a felony

179
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,979
um but the drone and he owes forty

180
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,530
thousand dollars for the drum so in

181
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,390
three cases he has established<font color="#E5E5E5"> a law for</font>

182
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">us just to show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how fun these cases</font>

183
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,729
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be alright the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one please</font>

184
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,440
whoops march of it all right this one's

185
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,100
a freebie you have the link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's</font>

did the old Leland but at any rate

196
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,840
you're going to be seeing in this one SI

197
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,669
a the key to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

unfortunately it has unfortunately it

calling in Coast Guard and so on and on

mine laying of course and then you also

265
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,910
have wire transfers and communication

266
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,490
systems but the one that the Navy was

267
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,990
interested is I told them I send them a

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and their their their funding they</font>

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,149
backseat driving for women is exactly

285
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,730
what is necessary back seat and what

286
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">woman will trust a man driving that no</font>

287
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,380
longer has control of how fast he's

288
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,779
going attorneys going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got news for you</font>

289
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,760
how many are married how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

290
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,699
wife safe slow down get in the right

291
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,040
lane did you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy over there hey</font>

292
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,748
wake up man who are you talking to stop

293
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to the left dry clothes it slow</font>

294
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:21,040
down drugs ooh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at you</font>

295
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:23,319
BTW think about it for a minute we're

296
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not going to trust our lives to</font>

297
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,878
something we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like flying</font>

298
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:30,209
anymore and you have a pilot links so

299
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,480
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not with the june you GT so</font>

300
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,479
let's get started

301
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,639
this is only 20 slides but they're

302
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:41,009
compressed I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

303
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,439
problem let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me see if I can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a</font>

304
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,569
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> better side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and show it to the</font>

305
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,849
risk of success<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it where this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

306
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:49,469
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> UAVs air defense systems and down</font>

307
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,350
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom is what is i'll be going</font>

308
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,389
over the risk of success of terrorist

309
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks against air defense systems is</font>

310
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:01,679
going up big time and why commercial

311
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,230
UAVs commercial systems are much more

312
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,529
available much more heavy much more

313
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,059
intelligence greater payloads and the

314
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,619
sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> oyed systems for collision</font>

315
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,988
avoidance are quite significantly

316
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:16,230
improved everything is better for

317
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:18,139
cheaper money you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a commercial</font>

318
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,309
one now as low as six hundred dollars

319
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,319
quadcopters and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way up to</font>

320
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,749
about two thousand dollars which is

321
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">still within the range of the other</font>

322
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:30,589
dollars if you will that are completely

323
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,589
armed

324
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,949
who everybody

325
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to give you how we look at this</font>

326
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,008
thing that the Ryan Nichols equations

327
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,040
have been used in the Department of

328
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:44,870
Defense since we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I don't</font>

329
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,019
know at least 25 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and basically</font>

330
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it says is that risks equals</font>

331
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:53,089
threats times vulnerabilities times

332
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,768
impact / countermeasures it's a

333
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,480
qualitative is also quantitative but

334
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,459
most the time qualitative and it can be

335
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">used by the logarithmic or otherwise you</font>

336
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,779
have legends of risk low medium high is

337
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,860
the simplest one of course that's

338
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot more than</font>

339
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,660
if you recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's state 0 that</font>

340
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,950
means of time of the attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

341
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,439
vulnerabilities in the system are always

342
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,620
there by<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of vulnerability as</font>

343
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,600
a system failure or system laws doesn't

344
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,630
mean a threat will go through it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

345
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,060
means it's there so it goes out in the

346
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">equation by derivatives meaning in its</font>

347
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,040
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time the vulnerability</font>

348
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,380
is there or not there doesn't matter

349
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,510
similarly impact like 911 what was the

350
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,840
impact in i lived well before the attack

351
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:42,180
nothing after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack huge billions</font>

352
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,690
but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the difference was at</font>

353
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,780
the point of attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> its state 0 it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

354
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:52,710
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a risk is a function of</font>

355
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:55,370
threats / countermeasures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

356
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:58,260
threat goes up risk goes up

357
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,300
countermeasures<font color="#CCCCCC"> go up risk goes down</font>

358
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,160
fairly straightforward and you can

359
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,079
qualitatively look at it that way that's

360
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,689
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of setting up</font>

361
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,010
our list of which you know twenty

362
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,630
percent risks thirty percent is forty

363
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,439
percent and we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in three</font>

364
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:16,960
categories worst-case best-case probable

365
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,270
case this is not onion on her

366
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,620
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at suas the small</font>

367
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,210
ones we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at something called</font>

368
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,070
collaboration which if you are a little

369
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:29,590
about we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look about on how SAA</font>

370
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,810
is such a key to the threat side of it

371
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,310
we want to expose something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call</font>

372
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,319
skater now skate has been around since

373
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,540
nineteen forty one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even then before</font>

374
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i think it was around when I was</font>

375
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,050
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Lincoln and I once said</font>

376
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,530
somebody earlier but they didn't know

377
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:52,420
what was linked and I were<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing</font>

378
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,980
this feeling anyway I want you also to

379
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,479
take a look at some of the cyber attack

380
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,240
vectors that are available through a

381
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,090
small UAS and then lastly one of our

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,650
conventional types of Defense's so if

383
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,690
you can read this and I can too i hope

384
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,790
the landscape is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start off a</font>

385
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,770
collaboration conventional vulnerability

386
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,699
start automation collaboration

387
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,310
conventional vulnerabilities

388
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,089
countermeasures commercial UAVs and then

389
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,489
the essay a systems

390
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you heard about automation you</font>

391
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,600
saw some wonderful pictures of

392
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,350
automation and how the levels are the

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,259
first to slave and automated basically

394
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,319
are available in every small UAV you can

395
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,240
buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for about six hundred dollars</font>

396
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,498
this second one maintains orders and can

397
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,579
receive orders but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

398
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:40,529
flight mission plan level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 adds the the</font>

399
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,660
navigation capability and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

400
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,459
more money 20 grand basically and here

401
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some examples microtome appliances</font>

402
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,199
micro copter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dragonfly</font>

403
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,459
what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a mission plan</font>

404
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,258
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that exists</font>

405
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,420
now and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about swarms in a</font>

406
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,350
totally different<font color="#CCCCCC"> manner you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

407
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,089
see that this is a dangerous copter

408
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,360
levels<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 and 5 you saw in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures</font>

409
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:06,480
basically these are either<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost fully</font>

410
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,990
automated or decision making artificial

411
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,610
intelligence they don't exist they exist

412
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,909
in laboratories at Kansas State we do

413
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,250
this we also are engaged in taking down

414
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:20,370
drones by a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of methods which</font>

415
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,839
will show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever the the point I'm</font>

416
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,250
trying to make is they perfectly don't

417
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,678
exist but there's a lot of money as you

418
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,120
saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous thing going into</font>

419
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,590
this kind of research it won't be long I

420
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,299
would say we within<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five-year planning</font>

421
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,480
period and you'll see some fully

422
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,158
automated stuff which goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> winds</font>

423
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,370
conversation early in the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

424
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:46,529
need outlaw I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we need to</font>

425
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:48,750
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments well whoever we need</font>

426
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,890
to change them because right now we

427
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,890
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right answer to anything</font>

428
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:58,100
so let's go here

429
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,950
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with drones well if we're</font>

430
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,469
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Hamas they have 200 drones in</font>

431
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fleet if you're looking at Hezbollah</font>

432
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,330
they have nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500 but you hear</font>

433
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like the drone guy that went</font>

434
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,760
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House gate right but</font>

435
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,160
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling you Hamas has nearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500</font>

436
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,570
in operation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would scare me more</font>

437
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">than a little silly character to tried</font>

438
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,720
to go over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fence okay so how do they</font>

439
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,159
collaborate yeah I'll do the collaborate

440
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,440
well the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is under an isolated</font>

441
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,660
condition they don't collaborate and the

442
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,680
countermeasure here is to shoot it down

443
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,730
disable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take it out in any way can</font>

444
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,860
sometimes that's pretty expensive by the

445
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,290
way especially if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a civilian</font>

446
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,139
area using a missile in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a civilian area</font>

447
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:45,440
tends to piss people off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get</font>

448
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,900
some collateral damage a group is just

449
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,710
an isolated group with no necessary

450
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,750
chief no but with a pre-programmed plan

451
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,970
meaning I'm going to attack this house

452
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,180
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send four or five of them</font>

453
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,620
to attack the house same type of thing

454
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,840
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can shoot them down i can track</font>

455
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,820
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got it we get</font>

456
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,980
into a new type of things teams now this

457
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,540
might be 50 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more a team the</font>

458
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,220
difference with teams is it's like the

459
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,409
military it's got a hierarchy this is

460
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,750
chief and each one has a section but you

461
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,460
can take out multiple targets in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

462
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,060
skies project they took out six targets

463
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,680
at the same time by the way it's in

464
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,409
australia new zealand and the united

465
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,560
states at the same time that's

466
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:31,460
impressive using satellite website<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

467
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">SAR tech um the thing is if you can get</font>

468
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of the chief at the head of the</font>

469
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,210
snake you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team you may not get</font>

470
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,660
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the targets but you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire</font>

471
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,420
group under control the last one is

472
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">swarming and swarming can be in any</font>

473
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,700
level and you can track these<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys they</font>

474
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,379
don't have have a cheap they come up on

475
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,200
radar but<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are</font>

476
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,350
starting from about a mile out from your

477
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,020
target just like the Special Ops guys

478
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I thought of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

479
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,700
is a pretty fast response time now when

480
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were doing nuclear studies it was</font>

481
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,850
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten seconds the current nuclear</font>

482
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,409
study still says about 26 minutes before

483
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,290
we wake up to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a nuclear</font>

484
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,880
tech on either side but technically the

485
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,510
pushing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> button is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds</font>

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,390
but the swarming here has a global

487
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:28,080
strategic view so if I shoot down 25 of

488
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,510
them out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred so what they're</font>

489
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,270
still coming and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if it's</font>

490
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,100
a nuclear plant but better yet I like

491
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,139
the attack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wind brought up that I</font>

492
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,669
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done yet and i will is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

493
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to attack some of the old university so</font>

494
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,950
i didn't like just think what we can do

495
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,740
with of say forty drones coming in on

496
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,420
you know Harvard<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I can show</font>

497
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,570
those assholes real quickly what they're

498
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,570
worth

499
00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a two-lane we've been harder to the</font>

501
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,129

509
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:20,269
stuff to hit the drum with problem is

510
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:22,189
where am i shooting from if I'm in

511
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,100
Baghdad this is a real big problem if

512
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,659
I'm in New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger one</font>

513
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,119
some of our nuclear study said that if

514
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:32,629
we drop some nuclear material in the

515

517
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to create a mass of fear it's not a</font>

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,590
massive destruction of the bomb whatever

519
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,490
the bomb does but the radiation is

520
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,740
massive fear because time distance and

521
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,950
removal are the defenses against

522
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,779
radiation and most things but turns out

523
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,200
what what the ISIS guys are doing

524
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,680
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the medical that strontium</font>

aren't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe and</font>

526
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,550
to you exactly

no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'll give me a second I'll here</font>

528
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,520
this is by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way from one before most</font>

529
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,780
experts on radiation<font color="#CCCCCC"> be given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i make</font>

sure i get a professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of physics</font>

and what he says as potential sources by

534
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,380
the way there's alpha gamma and beta

535

<font color="#E5E5E5">Vedas the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alphas nothing that's not</font>

536
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,950
nothing but it's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in terms of</font>

537
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,800
penetration pages of the wars but gamma

538
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,610
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that's the dangerous one and</font>

539
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,610
he basically says

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,880
fatal dose being 500 REM by the way

541
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,880
where'd they come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

542
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,530
how many when I came to Pennsylvania I

543
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,390
came up I found when I by my house the

544
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,030
fella to ask me if I wanted to split the

545
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,360
cost of radon how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of</font>

546
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:07,220
radon well coming from Texas there is no

547
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">such thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as right on well never heard</font>

548
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,730
of it before so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a scam</font>

549
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,850
but I let this character get away from

550
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,160
me for 2,500 bucks and then I found out

551
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a paper newspaper article that I</font>

552
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,590
was in a high section of radon well ray

553
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dawn's at the level according to the</font>

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,320
environmental protection agency which we

555
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,969
all trust with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearts if it is for</font>

556
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,240
forest considered the federal level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

557
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,650
when they measured mine it was 64 energy

558
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,540
though I had to have rigged on

559
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,280
remediation which by the way is about

560
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,559
twenty thousand dollars a headed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

561
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,940
cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house but they did it to</font>

562
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:45,000
four point

563
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,940
so I called the state and said you sent

564
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,139
me a bummer it didn't do their<font color="#CCCCCC"> job and</font>

565
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,970
they were forced to come back and drill

566
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,590
16 more holes in my ground if you ripped

567
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,210
if you've had any of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen put up</font>

568
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge thing that makes noise all night</font>

569
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,850
long like a helicopter but it's down 2.4

570
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,439

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:36,060
nasty stuff it's mostly gamma so here

581
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,090
right that's that's bad stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

582
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,090
Oh

583
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:48,039
that's correct here we go

584
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,600
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is how do we stop these</font>

585
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:53,379
guys what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current conventional</font>

586
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,320
ways and one is active active radar<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

587
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:59,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the other one is passive the</font>

588
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,450
active is basically a estimation of

589
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,860
distance approach speed size and

590
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,450
penetration and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking it out with</font>

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:11,559
some weapon missile nerf gun whatever

592
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,840
you like the the other way though is now

593
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,330
looking at it from an IR<font color="#E5E5E5"> from radio</font>

594
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,559
waves passive communication meaning i'm

595
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,019
going to track you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

596
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,210
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way to deal with you</font>

597
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:25,080
and unfortunately that's what we've

598
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,080
spent our money on

599
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,520
we're spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> our money on the passive</font>

600
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,770
all of them we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of passive stuff</font>

601
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,570
they have subnets that'll tell you where

602
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,889
the Russians are going all the time but

603
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,760
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean anything that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

604
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're coming they're</font>

606
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,180
coming they're coming they've now sent

608
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:45,170
they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and interestingly</font>

609
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,760
enough some of the Hamas people have

610
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,530
found ways to use counter counter

611

612
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,180
the stuff there were three levels that

00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,920
was first of all electronic operations

614
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,990
and there were countermeasures are what

615
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,820
was the CM and then we had CCM which is

no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> call that it's called recovery</font>

617
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,450
those were those secret things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

618
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,100
get because that was what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do</font>

619
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,590
once you knew you were being painted in

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,419

621
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,899
what would you do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send out a</font>

here are the groups we did take a look

664
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,690
at we'll just touch on and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do that they put it in the ASIC</font>

688
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:09,870
that scarier if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of our</font>

like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go here and wait until it</font>

724
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,410

no can't all right I took all the

at all these nice little pictures let me

755
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,059
go to a picture where I know I have one

with lots of these checking you know

found a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn all the valves on</font>

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:37,100
turn all the alarms off and do this

yeah what it's telling you to do the

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,220
alarms are off I've now turned out eight

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,309
destruction it was a simulation by the

791
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,408
way and I gave them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they went</font>

792
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:41,750
thought I literally closed off the doors

793
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,890
took a telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and going black means</font>

794
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,140
that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your telephone to</font>

797
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,678
what's fascinating is that this

798
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,030
convention center had about 600 people

799
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,590
in it and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're all</font>

800
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,178
technical guys like us here or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

801
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">people interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but not necessarily</font>

00:33:55,179 --> 00:34:00,670
anybody in the food chain above you

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,989
alone I was wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking he</font>

804
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,440
says kids you know I had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel next</font>

805
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:07,020
to me and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my liaison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">completely dark I can't see anybody</font>

807
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:14,859
suddenly the damn wall started talking

808
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:17,169
to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this size some guy says</font>

809
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me what do you mean I gotta shut down</font>

810
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:21,129
all our computers on our navigational

811

00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:25,569
goddamn submarine says the wall I said

813
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,159
yeah if you want to protect yourself

814
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">against skate attacks is exactly what</font>

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to do are you sure he yells I</font>

816
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,509
said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curl that was this he says</font>

817
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,440
that's Admiral so-and-so he's in charge

of the submarine<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

819
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,550
yes sir I'd be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than happy to go</font>

820
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,009
over this in detail next<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole came</font>

821
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,300
over here and he gave me some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

822
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,440
strange question I can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

823
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was just as you know very</font>

824
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">authoritative kind of guy I looked over</font>

825
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,848
who's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy Justin Secretary of</font>

826
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,319
Defense I said who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these walls</font>

827
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,540
they're talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me where they coming</font>

828
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:58,490
from apparently we were alive everywhere

829
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,170
and so I had Quentin I've never talked

830
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to walls before that it's a very you</font>

831
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,010
know you go home do you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drink</font>

832
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,868
after this it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a weird</font>

833
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,390
thing anyway SCADA systems are quite

834
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:13,369
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of damage that's</font>

835
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:15,710
positive why how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a car God how</font>

836
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:18,380
many have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kitchen how many do their</font>

837
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:21,890
wash in a laundry right or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

838
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:26,210
money how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a telephone or cell</font>

839
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:28,190
phone we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a computer am I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

840
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,980
them yet every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these is</font>

841
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,190
controlled by a skate assist and they've

842
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,770
been controlled or seven decades and

843
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,609
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level is on</font>

844
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:43,220
SCADA systems well it's not quite zero

845
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:45,430
closed but really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> small let's put</font>

846
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,430
it that way

847
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,410
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are technically not use</font>

850
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,069
they're technically not scared

00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,730
supervisory control and acquisition of

852

data systems are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the supervisor or</font>

853
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,809
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you named has a supervisor</font>

854
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,099
and those systems are in fact SCADA

855
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,099
systems they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very limited</font>

856
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,410
I call them mosquito system because they

857
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,859
act<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a SCADA system if it walks like</font>

858
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,210
a duck sounds like a duck it is about

859
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:19,229
but I agree there are some limited

860
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,400
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the limited</font>

861
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:22,468
sections underneath and real-time

862
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,410
analysis i agree with you at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

866
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,769
sense yes c language programs you can't

867
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,479
love all that together as from a

868
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,430
security standpoint there are at least

869
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:40,109
three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas there that have</font>

870
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,859
completely different security program

871
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:45,960
sure so lobbying it all together is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

872
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:50,489
it's not good way to think about the

873
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,680
students maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll explain to you after</font>

874
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:53,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary i</font>

875
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,249
thought how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to talking</font>

00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:58,240

side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coin</font>

878
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,109
if there's no security on any of those

879
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:06,390
three what does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

880
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,310
if I have a dollar change in quarters or

881
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,609
dimes it's double dollars injuries

882
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:15,390
security on most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us now that security</font>

883
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:18,120
is not very good yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay difference is</font>

884
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:21,720
the age of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlying system yes the</font>

885
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,330
older the worse well the legacy systems

886
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,970
tend to be the easier ones to attack Oh

887
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:30,060
many exceptions for instance a lot of

888
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:32,279
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> our systems are programmed</font>

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,009
something called a kyocera got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

902
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,910
point is the vulnerabilities in the

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,669
programming aren't what I'm talking

904
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,250
about I'm talking about the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

protection in a supervisory system that

of those systems are<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are designed</font>

Shaq who's controlling these things

913
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:29,220
that's what's interesting got concerned

914
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:32,640
about the in terms if I can turn off the

than<font color="#CCCCCC"> idiot I've got them and I don't</font>

919

care what the doggone hardware so it

920
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,600
looks like other software looks like I

921
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,370
don't even care what the theoretical

922
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,250
side of it looks like if I can change

923
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,920
the data which we do if i can make the

system do something that it's unexpected

925
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,810
if you will from the operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint</font>

926
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have them and that's what I'm talking</font>

about if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can insert data through the</font>

remembered on a pilot look and now we

00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,470
have it best we have a ground system

looking at making a SAP system on the to

932
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,209
the ground system at best I'm telling

<font color="#E5E5E5">the UAV that it has whether death it's</font>

all right it's picked up by the UN<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diaz</font>

938
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,779
oops wait a min I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

hurricane even though there's no

954
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,779
the smart skies project is you want to

<font color="#E5E5E5">have control of some particular</font>

most easy right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is whether the other</font>

way does that make sense my suggestion

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,470
main point is valid we can agree to

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,930
disagree on that one but does the

concept get across because<font color="#CCCCCC"> in practice</font>

978
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,220
it then at the laboratory that's what we

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,360
do think we're all aware of this already

on well you've got it depends on where

extraordinaire I agree I haven't found

that because aren't we a much more gross

the primary risks you know where where

1043
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,569
do I have the hiatus the time scales

that you heard me talk about or not

1045
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:59,609
relevant well Rick's under Nevada write

least at our all-time source you think

1052
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:19,170
i'll share up chunks we figured out how

1053
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:21,440
to do have equipment yeah also you know

1054
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,440
I think

1055
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,200
ok that is if any Alan

1056
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,590
right

1057

oh yeah

Oh

you can I have to tell you we have not

1086

looked like that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> command more</font>

there's a different level of elegance

1090
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:55,839
yeah in sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific data which will</font>

00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:48,029
some of the most practical attacks can't

1144
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,879
be the most elegant as well as protocol

and then be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a taxonomy what</font>

1197

me say that black boy I guess plus and

1198
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:02,180
plus we had control over what we were

1199
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:06,559
putting in each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got an aerodrome</font>

1200
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:08,719
we had a a Cessna 168 and so we knew

1201
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,569
what we were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we had controlled</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">over as much as we could control but</font>

1203
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:15,170
they're all within a limited range of

1204
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:17,450
the field and the field is what five

miles that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross-country that's</font>

robbery<font color="#CCCCCC"> bidders attack oh yeah you don't</font>

1208
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,900
care about that all right over here yeah

1209
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,180
our job was to see with a controller

1210
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,380
take it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in theory then we had</font>

wanted to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it was just</font>

1213
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">our that was just our design methodology</font>

1214
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:49,540
that was there was no instruction to do

1215
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,430
this nobody said you can't do it we had

licenses to get this stuff but nobody

00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,629
said you must do it this way no it was

1221
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,939
they were more concerned with we have

here<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros out startup we have a budget</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know if a drone attack hits a particular</font>

that typical what would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top 12 15</font>

1232
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:30,630
attacks based on a drone system that we

1233
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">should concern ourselves and then what</font>

1234
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,080
ranking even though they couldn't get we

1235
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,900
had no data other than qualitative

1236
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">quantitative no quantitative or say</font>

1237
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,010
Naida that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop fast enough to</font>

1238
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,510
give them the qualitative you can you

1239
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,130
can do a delta approach you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a</font>

look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can there are lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1241
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,870
ways to get qualitative if you if you

1242
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,250
see the risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk and proves</font>

1243
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,870
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular threat that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have so</font>

1244
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:55,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have a qualitative one</font>

1245
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,470
basically much more difficult than low

1246
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,800
medium high<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that kind of thinking</font>

1247
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:03,970
and so the answer was give me a taxonomy

1248
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:05,380
and a list that was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and so</font>

1249
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,060
there were limited things that we could

1250
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,340
do there's a lot of these I'd like to do

1251
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm adding the tiny one into the back of</font>

00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">my head right now and I'm expanding it</font>

1253
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,860
ed unit expanding it to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

1254
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:20,080
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've heard here today</font>

1255
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:21,640
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my problem is I have funds and</font>

1256
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,600
students who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to graduate which</font>

1257
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,879
means we have to go through the whole

1258
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,920
process of studying there not one

1259
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,930
hundred percent you understand if I get

1260
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,530
short terms generally have them in a

1261
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">master's for five courses that's what I</font>

1262
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,980
got and so I have to work within that

1263
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,350
time frame I don't I don't have it I'm

1264
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,190
not paying a much either you understand

1265
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:43,368
they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grade that basic</font>

1266
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,770
they're quite good and they're the

1267
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:48,140
sharpest can be but at the same time we

1268
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,690
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a limitations ok have a good</font>

1269
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,879
question good I'm good I'm on my

1270
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:55,930
questions here I like the new drones

1271
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,930
that are they

1272
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh

1273
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,309
right
