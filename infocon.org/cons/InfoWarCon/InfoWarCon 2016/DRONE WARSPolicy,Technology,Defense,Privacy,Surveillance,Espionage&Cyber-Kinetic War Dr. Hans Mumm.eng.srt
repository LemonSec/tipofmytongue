00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,080
leadership this is really what I'm

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,390
focusing on and what the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> book in</font>

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,250
something i'll be working with professor

40
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,710
Randall on as well I'll talk to you

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,380
about that in a few minutes looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

42
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,750
this I teach for california university

of pennsylvania i teach for<font color="#E5E5E5"> homeland</font>

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there each for american</font>

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,319
military university i teach intelligence

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,120
studies at that University and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

47
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,670
also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> member with Kansas State</font>

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,069
University unmanned aerial systems board

49
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,399
and that's how Randy and I actually know

50
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,280
each other on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fo I created something</font>

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,120
called the FAA's first certified flight

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,010
simulator

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,739
this is actually such an advanced

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,530
simulator that you can sit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

55
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,680
simulator and flying the simulator and

56
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,440
log up to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your log book it's</font>

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,650
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> an advanced simulator and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,349
say there is 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k-stew cockpit</font>

59
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,049
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a rather interesting project</font>

60
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:52,048
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually part owner in that as</font>

61
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,150
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course my sponsor here</font>

62
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a current fellow for autonomous</font>

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,790
systems for cyber conflict documentation

64
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,129
project and it is ccdp by the way who is

65
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">making the books available to you at no</font>

66
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:14,149
cost and who brought me to this event

67
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">so thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in theirs and their sponsor</font>

68
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,770
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through embracing</font>

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,390
change in a nonlinear world so keep in

70
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,460
mind the plan change keeps you in

71
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,739
control force change moves you two

72
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,070
closer to obsolescence one of the issues

73
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,950
that has occurred right now for the

74
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,250
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time drones actually delivered a</font>

75
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,500
package to a residential area in Nevada

76
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,390
just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,490
cheering and saying oh this is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,070
wonderful well something that was

79
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,910
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of presentations so</font>

80
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:50,700
far is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's awesome</font>

81
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:55,310
but what standards are these drones

82
00:03:50,700 --> 00:04:00,269
under there under none and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

83
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,700
ISO 9000 standards and of production

84
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,820
standards there are none most of these

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,769
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually created and built</font>

86
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,709
over in China we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they of course</font>

87
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">China</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follows only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the strictest</font>

88
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,270
processes when they build things and

89
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,579
they have it all documented to as well

90
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">right ITIL certified everything China</font>

91
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,400
right now so the challenge is although

92
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a great idea it's a real</font>

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,900
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now we have drones</font>

94
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,600
that are flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are under no</font>

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard whatsoever and we're flying</font>

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,490
these things / people which again I

97
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,770
encourage and I love the idea that we're

98
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">moving in that direction we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font>

99
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to watch what's going on with how</font>

100
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">standardized these things are and how</font>

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,890
safe they are in the long run not before

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">we begin the illiterate of the 21st</font>

103
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">century will not be those who cannot</font>

104
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,750
read or write<font color="#E5E5E5"> but those who cannot learn</font>

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,120
and unlearn this is going to be very

106
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">important because we literally need to</font>

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,300
ship the definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what literacy is</font>

108
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,120
because literacy is no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to read the right the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,380
be able to learn and unlearn what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,510
know and be able to relearn something

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,669
different technology is simply moving

113
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,669
too fast not to do that

114
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,940
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide in a</font>

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,580
little while with the future distributed

116
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,550
architecture that I will talk about a

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,919
real challenge that we have is that

118
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,890
everybody is looking at their exact same

119
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,750
stovepipe the thing on 911 that

120
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,820
everybody screamed about was well

121
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,800
everything is stovepipe we have to stop

122
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,760
we have to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working together we</font>

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,890
need sharing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome now we have</font>

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,050
this thing called robotics unmanned

125
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,150
underwater systems unmanned boats

126
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,210
unmanned ground vehicles unmanned air

127
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,460
systems us in every other country right

128
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,070
now is looking at every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of</font>

129
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,130
these as a single technology it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a</font>

130
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">single technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's robotics and it's</font>

131
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,510
a ton of a systems and they will all

132
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,700
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move in the same direction the</font>

133
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:10,289
games<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we play when we were kids and</font>

134
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,270
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us play now is what's going to</font>

135
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,100
happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world that's where</font>

136
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,200
we're going to move autonomous systems

137
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,330
from the cyber world where<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

138
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,159
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the physical world where</font>

139
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,800
we make them happen and we give the

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,170
machines the ability to learn move and

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">change well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge with that is</font>

142
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:31,230
is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our policies rules and</font>

143
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,710
laws are written based on the stove pipe

144
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,470
so the FAA is writing laws right now and

145
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,299
policies based on unmanned air systems

146
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:44,349
that's great

147
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,620
google has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google car it's an unmanned</font>

148
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:50,409

152
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,900
laws when reality hits that an unmanned

153
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,740
air vehicle is going to come and refuel

154
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,580
your unmanned ground vehicle nobody is

155
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,650
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not thinking in that</font>

156
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:20,469
direction that's why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

188
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,099
the importance

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,690
there's a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability to</font>

and a few others it does have that

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:34,600

not one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our definitions what a human</font>

is on the evolutionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> chain</font>

195
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,690
challenge we have is that people are

196
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually looking at this and saying okay</font>

197
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the laws</font>

198
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:52,810
right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have UAVs that we can shoot</font>

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sky or we hope we can and</font>

200
00:10:52,810 --> 00:11:00,670
they're if they're dangerous but once we

201
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,650
move to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next level and we have</font>

202
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,640
robots that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually doing things</font>

203
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,819
for us does the robot actually have

204
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,819
legal rights

205
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,199
so now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it wings</font>

206
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,220
favorite part which is killer drones I

207
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,140
just had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw that one in there</font>

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,130
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you too</font>

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:56,498
again yeah nothing can go wrong right

<font color="#E5E5E5">chainsaw true</font>

214
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:18,609
does actually I'm failure one point but

215
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,819
we actually have people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

216
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,819
in this instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,080
right

221
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:51,350
so much for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one so again and they</font>

222
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just came up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this idea and they</font>

223
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,760
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out all of the</font>

224
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,220
different mechanisms in order to be able

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,130
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote control run the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine what people are going to do as</font>

228
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,570
things move forward and they get even

229
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">more inventive down the road now what do</font>

230
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,560
we say with the United States Department

231
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,500
of Defense you know how are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

232
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,400
at this drone issue well autonomous

233
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:23,570
lethal robot concept must be on the

234
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:26,840
table the DoD official set<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now</font>

235
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:29,720
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're looking at is is they're</font>

241
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,360

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,170
we're smart and anything that precedes

theory and understanding how you're

talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other do they have the</font>

292
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,360
ability for goals do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to move in a different direction</font>

294
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:10,770
do they have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

295
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,119
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be like them</font>

296
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,069
probably not we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend a</font>

297
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,020
billion dollars getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things to</font>

298
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,329
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and maybe ten things</font>

299
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to each other and we may not be</font>

300
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,010
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right direction remember</font>

301
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,140
that architecture the challenge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

302
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,600
have is that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you can actually</font>

303
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">take an unmanned air vehicle an unmanned</font>

304
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,629
ground vehicle you

305
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,510
UV and a boat and you can all send them

306
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,890
towards the same goal so you can launch

307
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,350
them from<font color="#CCCCCC"> different parts of the world</font>

308
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now and I can simply give them a</font>

309
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,049
goal and the air vehicle remember we

310
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,600
have we have Wi-Fi everywhere the air

311
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,450
vehicle can just tap into Wi-Fi along

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,100
the way you can look up weather com can

313
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,679
find out you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,689
buckhead wins for the next two hours so

315
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to land I'm going to save my</font>

316
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,890
fuel and weather.com says that I'm going

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have tailwinds in about three hours</font>

318
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,700
so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take back off in three</font>

319
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,620
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

320
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,380
matches its goal so all of these

321
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">vehicles can emerge at the same time at</font>

322
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,659
the same space when they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

323
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font>

324
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,869
warm theory isn't going to get you where

325
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:26,210
you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go but we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font>

326
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:28,399
a billion dollars look so

327
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,960
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last slide where they were</font>

328
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about having robots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going first</font>

329
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,140
this is what they're actually this is

330
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,870
another dark or program that's actually

331
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,390
extremely successful and they have

332
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,810
multiples of them you will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

333
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,360
these out there being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go E and</font>

334
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,580
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in first but these are mules</font>

335
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,320
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first prototype</font>

336
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,919
so that's why it's extremely loud

337
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,429
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot wire down</font>

338
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:02,140
but you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

339
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:05,410
thing bring logistics bring guys off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

340
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,990
battlefield who are hurt and you can

341
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,990
then also get them into multiple

342
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:33,620
propaganda this is a Russian property

343
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:37,510
but they did a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> job literally what</font>

344
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,510
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new hat job and was cry</font>

345
00:19:43,029 --> 00:20:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty soon so again we kind of smiling</font>

346
00:19:47,989 --> 00:20:02,749
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> billion dollars it's</font>

347
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,950
warm area that we've known about for

348
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:09,289
almost 35 yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was it again we're</font>

349
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending a billion dollars on an area</font>

350
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,599
that we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 35 year old</font>

351
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">all that</font>

352
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,480
or change the modules so that's again

353
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:05,330
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting system from that</font>

354
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,580
point of view is now what if you wanted

355
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,480
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else in there what if you want</font>

356
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:14,480
a different military payload that maybe

357
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,340
goes in and does bad thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

358
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,340
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interesting part about this</font>

359
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,830
is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually built modularity and</font>

360
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,529
they built movement it built freedom of

361
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,230
movement into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system where a lot of</font>

362
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,990
the UAVs that are out there right now

363
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,510
they have a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> large tail to a</font>

364
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,870
predator system things like that it's

365
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,510
people think Oh unmanned air system yeah

366
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,149
well there's 50 or 100 guys on the

367
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,809
ground supporting that one unmanned air

368
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:47,360
system so you know this gives an offer

369
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,549
for a modular system and it gives it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

370
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,039
ability to be moved rather simply

well as robotic issues or<font color="#CCCCCC"> average folks</font>

383
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,980
who understand this they're buried entry

384
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,740
is a thousand dollars two thousand

385
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,279
dollars maybe it's the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> sedan they</font>

386
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:55,130
they simply automated and put weapons on

387
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,779
it or they put explosives into it so

388
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">their barrier of entry is nothing</font>

389
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,340
they're more than willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer up</font>

390
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,969
the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> sedan for their you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font>

391
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:08,540
their cause right well barrier to entry

392
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:11,150
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a country trying to</font>

393
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,990
defend against this to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deal</font>

394
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:17,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this is in tens of millions</font>

395
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:21,170
normally in the billions so we have a

396
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,600
lopsided barrier of entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> where bad</font>

397
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,090
folks can get it this stuff really

398
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,520
really cheap and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defend</font>

399
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:32,449
against it or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay on par with</font>

400
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,430
them actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very expensive for us</font>

401
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,430
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deal with yes</font>

402
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,590
you

403
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,139
we are

404
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,160
so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of both so they're</font>

405
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:56,430
out there trolling this wonderful world

406

out there and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know we put a little bit too much out</font>

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">there I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think especially in some of the</font>

410
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,260
academia community sometimes trying to

411
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,510
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be published</font>

412
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,170
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put too much out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

413
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:16,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's using some of our</font>

414
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:19,500
technology against us and sometimes just

415
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,200
pure innovation<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their systems what</font>

416
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,360
they're using are so crude I mean

417
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally that the trigger block was</font>

418
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,149
basically a bold and or in order to hit

419
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,070
make that actuator actuate and actuate

420
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,000
the trigger it was literally using like

421
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,889
a bolt of so yes now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't they don't</font>

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,390
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the safety they don't worry</font>

423
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,830
about the laws they don't worry about

424
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,580
regulations they don't worry about

425
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,320
unions they can simply go and invent put

426
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,889
it right into place and put it right

427
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,510
into use we're all of us in the

428
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,310
government and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not guinea and everything</font>

429
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,780

find on the web there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of videos</font>

out there where they show you how to

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video camera and make that into</font>

given a much smaller logistics footprint

479
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,320
for the attacker and the ability to mass

from dispersed points with far less

482
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,699
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me phrase the question another way</font>

483
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,990
how close are we to the typical this is

484
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,000
or small

485
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,590
so I'll answer that in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

486
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,410
different ways so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the ways that</font>

487
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,600
this actually helps them quite a bit is

488
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:47,690
it takes away our TT takes away our

489
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,469
tactics training<font color="#E5E5E5"> and procedures because</font>

490
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:55,760
we are fighting one direction and and so

491
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,700
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the human</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh is our</font>

492
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,840
issue right we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not looking at what do</font>

493
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,480
we came here and so if I have to spend

494
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,570
ammunition and I have to spend resources

495
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,760
taking out robotics platforms that means

496
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,370
that the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are controlling</font>

497
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,809
them who I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take out are</font>

498
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,340
still putting you know they're still

499
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:18,410
there it does become that force

500
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,110
multiplier that where it's very

501
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult to deal with how close are we</font>

502
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,030
to actually having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with this</font>

503
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,729
stuff it's out there now we just simply

504
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:31,428
are dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as much because</font>

505
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:34,490
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in we're technically not in</font>

506
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,920
any boards right right now we're in

507
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,980
we're in peacekeeping operations if we

508
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,559
were at war at any place on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet</font>

509
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,350
then you're going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more</font>

510
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,770
and more of these just like the IEDs if

511
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,219
you know something works you send it out

512
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,730
in mass maybe we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at reality</font>

513
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:58,880
IEDs will come to this country by their

514
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:01,870
effective and they're cheap

515
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,870
people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have that</font>

516
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,580
you

you

519
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,350
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've learned much because</font>

520
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:27,110
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look because if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of you know how did we end up</font>

522
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:33,199
taking Russia down for a while because

523
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:35,780
another back how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that during</font>

524
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,450
economics right how are they however

525
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,178
they collapsing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> world's right</font>

526
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,580
now through economics because they can

527
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:46,820
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all of our our billions of</font>

528
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,799
dollars of technology and with about a

529
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,750
hundred bucks worth of actuators

530
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,360
everything else they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either come on</font>

531
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,970
par with us or come above us and so we

532
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't learned that much we've learned</font>

533
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,070
ever more inventive ways of killing each

534
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,049
other we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done that but have we</font>

535
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:07,129
learned the economics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all oh</font>

540
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:24,500
develop

541
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:27,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a good choice</font>

542
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,200
and so it wasn't

543
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,939
system collapsed although it's not good

544
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,380
for doing actually needed logical most

common

546
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:41,020
on because they were thought they were

547
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,189
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a Marxist dustrial age and</font>

548
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,930
didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

549
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,610
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways in which</font>

danger I realizing they're no longer

551
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,679
correct that's what's scaring me with

552
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the robotic systems the entire gambit of</font>

00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,290
them is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're about to</font>

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,260
make one of those policy decisions best

are not understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire tired</font>

556
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,120
loving this view we've already hit it I

557
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:11,920
mean so now the good thing is is that we

558
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,919
do have some in the anti-drug

559
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,960
remember we spent on that money building

560
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,509
good

561
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,409
make them very

562
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,409
now we have

563
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:38,470
khalid el fire missiles you know kills

564
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,470

you want to have a rush

horseback

570
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:20,159
so who becomes more important the kid

571
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,160
who knows how to play a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> game</font>

even those that believe a video game you

look that's a game controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using</font>

578
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:43,470
of a ship that's what he's using this

579
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,060
game controller imagine a camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

580
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:52,500
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a new perspective outward you</font>

581
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:59,429
go there imagine a camera that follows

582
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:07,350
these imagine a camera that sets you

583
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:12,270
free introducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> nixie the wearable</font>

584
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:14,310
camera that flies on command<font color="#CCCCCC"> nixie is</font>

585
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,960
the first wearable and flyable camera

586
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,900
that you carry on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrist like a</font>

587
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,720
watch unfold the flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands and</font>

588
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,020
nixie is ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> takeoff there's no</font>

589
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,429
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick c is for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

590
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,389
to capture and share a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new perspective</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on their adventures</font>

592
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:39,170
so consider consider the the locker room

593
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:43,429
in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high school and you you would</font>

594
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:48,970
never imagine that you know a young man

595
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,969
in high school would think of that one

596
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,980
you

597
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,150
I

598
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">our needle there's a correct and by the</font>

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,940

600
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">step the next logical to that by the way</font>

601
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,640
actually quantum teleportation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font>

602
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,590
can actually a drop it in so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

603
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about back that dimension travel</font>

604
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,360
later on down the down the road but

605
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,399
there's a lot of civilian UAV missions

606
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,350
that's out there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you</font>

607
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,170
know you hear about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of military</font>

608
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,210
ones and you hear about the the this

609
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,070
what they were deeming successes with

610
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,230
the predator systems that are out there

611
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,510
keep in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the predator system</font>

612
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,970
was actually never supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be filled</font>

613
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,700
it as a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> system it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

614
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,680
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an RD system for the</font>

615
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">global hawk it was never actually</font>

616
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,770
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc and so the predator</font>

617
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,310
system that's out there now is far and

618
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:27,180
away advanced for the predator for what

619
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:29,610
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end all be all so</font>

620
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,600
a lot of applications out there right

621
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,940
now for the civilian world

622
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,210
but again privacy concerns are there

623
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,850
those the little kid is asking Santa so

624
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,340
if you know when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sleeping and</font>

625
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,740
you know when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been awake and you</font>

626
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,970
know we've been bad or good you're

627
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:53,629
flying a surveillance drone aren't you

628
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:56,720
so to which of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course Santa has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no reply</font>

629
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:59,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a bunch different</font>

630
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,730
concerns you have out there for privacy

631
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,770
concerns hacking in cyber obviously this

632
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,840
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right converse to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

633
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,480
peeping toms harassment and surveillance

634
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,720
well hardly issue too is when you're

635
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,880
looking at the hacking and cyber is that

636
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,629
people may be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> filming</font>

637
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,560
themselves doing whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

638
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:24,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hacked and again no bad can</font>

639
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,480
ever happen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right that's how</font>

640
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,370
all those celebrities end up with x

641
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,030
rated videos out there is because they

642
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">use awesome encryption on their systems</font>

643
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:39,620
so so we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

644
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,260
what happens when innocent people are

645
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,819
simply doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to do</font>

646
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,740
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their drones or want to do with</font>

647
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,740
their equipment and it gets taken over

648
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,660
they get in a lot of trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so</font>

649
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,779
right now the FAA says that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

650
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,149
we have to register our drones well I

651
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,370
registered mine and my little

652
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,610
registration sticker is on my drone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

653
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:06,140
I have my little<font color="#CCCCCC"> F a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> license in my in my</font>

654
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:09,140
pocket that's great but my Jerome goes

655
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:13,170
astray or somebody takes over my drone

656
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,650
or somebody's using my number

657
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:19,170
mmm the FAA didn't think of that one

658
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody is using my number guess who</font>

659
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:26,730
they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and knock on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the door me guess</font>

660
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:29,609
who they come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rass try to arrest me</font>

661
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:32,040
I may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even own that drone but now we</font>

662
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:35,160
went from perception<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innocence</font>

663
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,680
presumption of guilt based on nothing

664
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,129
more than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that I had to give</font>

665
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,740
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that anybody can get</font>

666
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,330
off my<font color="#E5E5E5"> drone if you see me flying and</font>

667
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,279
you take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number you simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

668
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,279
take that number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on your drum</font>

669
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,250
thanks

670
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,110
however

671
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,390
outstanding I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

672
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,810
for telling me it gives me one more

673
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:13,480
reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have anything fly anyway</font>

674
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:30,100
so so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we well are we encouraging</font>

675
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:32,920
innovation or we are we encouraging the

676
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:39,339
UAV and be able to fire the weapon off

677
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:42,210
of the UAV now innovative people who

678
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:45,640
like to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good in the innovation</font>

679
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:49,000
but I just saw was a very innovative

680
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,700
young man who could figure out a control

681
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,590
theory and control platform to be able

682
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,960
to keep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing from flipping</font>

683
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,840
backwards and he kept it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air and</font>

684
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,300
pretty darn stable and on target right

685
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:06,270
that's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the FAA saw</font>

686
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,270
they were thrilled this young<font color="#E5E5E5"> man didn't</font>

687
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:16,500
they were so happy they sent law

688
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:20,950
enforcement out what law did he break

689
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,650
mommy break break innings

690
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:28,598
the best you can ever get somebody on

691
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,099
right now or this or flying over and

692
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,550
assuming because keep in mind the

693
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:35,950
gentleman in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kentucky made leaps of</font>

694
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:40,450
faith we all saw the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in the news</font>

695
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:43,569
where the drone<font color="#CCCCCC"> was flying over and he</font>

696
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:47,759
thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was filming his daughter</font>

697
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,760
as teenage daughter sunbathing

698
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,510
time that was a leap of faith based on

699
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,340
what the media makes you believe one you

700
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,740
had no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that drone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was off course</font>

701
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,660
or if it was truly over your house to

702
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,790
you had no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the sensors were</font>

703
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,129
that were on that drone were they

704
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,680
actually a camera or was it just flying

705
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,440
over was it truly filming your daughter

706
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,279
or did you make the leap of<font color="#E5E5E5"> faith based</font>

707
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,460
on the media<font color="#CCCCCC"> hypes care and and privacy</font>

708
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,600
rights which by the way amendment has

709
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,890
been blown for years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has been blown</font>

710
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">along your satellites bent over your</font>

711
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">head</font>

712
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,049
now you're complaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a drone so</font>

713
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,720
now the gentleman who actually shot that

714
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:34,180
you Evi out of the sky ended up in some

715
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,600
trouble because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> took the leap of</font>

716
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:40,120
faith<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he ended up shooting</font>

717
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,569
the challenge we have there what's the

718
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,180
average person supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so if you</font>

719
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,640
are the average person and you saw this

720
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,339
in your backyard or you saw this in your

721
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,240
neighbors are you saw this weapon firing

722
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,510
off the UAV platform what would you do

723
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">they would</font>

724
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:01,640
well or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might dial 911 right because</font>

725
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,090
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you've been brainwashed I</font>

726
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,629
mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what even told it is dial</font>

727
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,850
911 right what can 911 do love it how

728
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,520
many how many law enforcement officials

729
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:17,960
have we actually trained and I mean

730
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,790
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTP the entire thing how many</font>

731
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have we ever trained for</font>

732
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:25,160
anti-drone unless I'm missing something

733
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,280
the answer is nothing so when you dial

734
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,339
911 the best you're ever going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get if</font>

735
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,960
you can find out the drone operator and

736
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,670
everything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a nuisance</font>

737
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,580
violation well not necessarily so you

738
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,820
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that but right now that was</font>

739
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:46,130
what the the the Kentucky when the 911

740
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,140
operator sent the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police out to the</font>

741
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,970
the gentleman in Kentucky they were

742
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,950
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what our essay they</font>

743
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,600
could charge this guy with and the best

744
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,910
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could try to figure out on that day</font>

745
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,140
was a nuisance violation that was their

746
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,060
challenge but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get any more than</font>

747
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:02,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that when you're leading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

748
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">resurrection to the summary so so the</font>

749
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,860
challenge here though is that the FAA

750
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:10,130
went up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically was trying to</font>

751
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,590
harass this kid and and look to see

752
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:18,760
could they<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge him with something</font>

753
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:20,950
again it well ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to uh but the</font>

754
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,960
challenge is is again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the innovative</font>

755
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:26,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">nature of what's going on out there in</font>

756
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,520
the market so here's prison care package

757
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:32,490
yeah so these are only the ones that

758
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,710
they've stopped

759
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:39,299
they've actually had more successful

760
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:41,730
drops than they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had stops so by the</font>

761
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">way if something in case anybody is</font>

762
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:46,130
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested cell phones are</font>

763
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:50,090
actually working more than drugs and

764
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:53,790
cigarettes in prisons is its control

765
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,170
control on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have so</font>

766
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,779
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

767
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,869
this I've attempted to talk to the

768
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,750
Bureau of Prisons at one point we'll see

769
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:06,300
where that one goes my questions of them

770
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,660
was when was the last time that you ever

771
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,410
trained for a prison<font color="#CCCCCC"> break and they said</font>

772
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,450
half I said well right now no you're

773
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,600
showing something they could obviously

774
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,970
has a pound or two or the stuff on it I

775
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,200
said what happens when it becomes binary

776
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">not c4 to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pours heavy binary is much</font>

777
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,740
lighter it has much more BTW you a much

778
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">more punch power than then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> c4 does so</font>

779
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,850
what happens when you fly one of these

780
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:38,609
things into the side of your wall with

781
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,779
binary on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes your wall out now you</font>

782
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,440
have a prison break<font color="#E5E5E5"> when was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

783
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,420
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever trained for a prison break</font>

784
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,400
it is now legal for North Dakota police

785
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,800
to use drones to fire tasers and tear

786
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,600
gas at people thanks to the work of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

787
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">lobbyist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who represents law enforcement</font>

788
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,960
and has ties with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drone industry a</font>

789
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,820
bill was passed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the North Dakota</font>

790
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">State House that allows police to use</font>

791
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,510
armed drones nothing will go wrong here

792
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,279
after obtaining a search warrant from a

793
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,390
judge North Dakota police can deploy

794
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,000
drones to collect the real-time

795
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,009
intelligence video for criminal evidence

796
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,510
these police drones however are now also

797
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,790
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carry less than lethal</font>

798
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,670
weapons like rubber bullets pepper spray

799
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">tear gas sound cannons and tasers but</font>

800
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:19,080
even less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than Lee the weapons can kill</font>

801
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,790
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Guardian at least 39</font>

802
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,730
people have been killed by police Tasers

803
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,560
in 2015 with these weapons police could

804
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,780
potentially fire on criminal suspects

805
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,609
from far away much like how US Air Force

806
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,559
drone pilots bomb Isis militants from

807
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:35,049
tells me that according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FAA</font>

808
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,519
401 drone operations were undertaken by

00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:38,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Grand Forks County North Dakota</font>

811
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:42,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">years the department insists there were</font>

812
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:44,769
only 21 flights drones are seen as a

813
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:46,419
positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in North Dakota which</font>

814
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:47,979
according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the daily least maybe the</font>

815
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,359
reason why few people noticed when the

816
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:52,930
House bill passed with a clause allowing

817
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:56,038
them to be armed with minh so another

818
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:59,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting statistic their 401</font>

819
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:01,930
applications had to have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> filed for</font>

820
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:04,359
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FAA to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number 401</font>

821
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:08,759
they don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the number up the</font>

822
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:12,538
401 applications had to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been filed</font>

823
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:15,989
the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> said they only did 20 10</font>

824
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,989
who's Hellinger

825
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,839
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> target possibly blows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

826
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:23,450
actually could be so one of the

827
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:26,210
challenges is the difference of orbits

828
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus targeting so the challenge could</font>

829
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:33,619
be is in how they're actually keeping

830
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:37,069
statistics and again since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

831
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:39,819
ability at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

832
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:43,430
understand the entire robotic platforms

833
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:46,160
we're not putting in standards for even

834
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:50,950
standards for reporting how does it we

835
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,950
we end up with 401 and 21

836
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,080
correct farmers correct so farmers and

837
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,980
other people can file for the capability

838
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,930
and again that's that's where some of

839
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,940
these statistics start to get skewed

840
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,580
because we don't have standards for what

841
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:13,660
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that truly means it's simply a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

842
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:16,000
waiver under the triple 333 rule for the

843
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,670
FAA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks that are</font>

844
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,150
out there put a man but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

845
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:24,280
reports like this you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

846
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,900
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way right if you're if you're</font>

847
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">against drones and you're against the</font>

848
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:32,040
technology that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nice</font>

849
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:36,129
comparison of you know a drone strike

850
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,990
overseas came into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge with</font>

851
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is is that we've gone from</font>

852
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:44,290
we've gone from surveillance

853
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:47,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">less-than-lethal when do we make the</font>

854
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,009
jump to lethal

855
00:47:53,910 --> 00:48:01,509
here you go so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read file suit</font>

856
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,349
that's why i say i mean it's soo more

857
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:07,200
interesting Oh with some of this

858
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:10,079
so now talked about a couple of

859
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">different ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how these things</font>

860
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">change your life will guess what they're</font>

861
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,710
going to even change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life at the</font>

862
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:19,200
grocery store so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's here's an</font>

863
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:23,489
autonomous robot as a grocery shopping

864
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">assistant the grocery cart itself will</font>

865
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:28,979
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you it will</font>

866
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:31,559
autonomously follow you and and I how's

867
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:35,160
your virtual grocery list that you sent

868
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:38,819
it from your iPad or Apple and it will

869
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,848
actually tell you where the items are if

870
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:44,369
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on sale what shelf there on what</font>

871
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:45,930
aisle their own of they'll give you all

872
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:47,190
of that information and one of the

873
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that they're also looking at</font>

874
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,460
doing it will the database to identity

875
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:55,079
identify location of the product one of

876
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,680
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're also looking at is is</font>

877
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:01,019
tagging all of this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data</font>

878
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,089
would never be tagged for bad purposes

879
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:07,470
that's why you gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> away all your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

880
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:09,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">care data right so if you're a diabetic</font>

881
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:13,618
and you're buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> gallons of ice cream</font>

882
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:16,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your cart knows it not trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

883
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:20,210
that they would ever ever use data

884
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:23,729
against you in any way whatsoever

885
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:27,660
something to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can do it now</font>

886
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:29,009
based on your your card but that's just

887
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,440
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your card if you don't use your</font>

888
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">card then they can't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is easy this</font>

889
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,249
is actually going to get to the point

890
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:38,479
where it's all tagged together what

891
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:38,479
you're doing with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> grocery list</font>

892
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,619
yeah if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like your traffic are you</font>

893
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:55,030
like your shopping cart<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give me show</font>

894
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:58,110
ya the answer is probably not at some

895
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,110
point probably not

896
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,299
you

897
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:47,920
they calculated that in but this is just

898
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:50,709
something to consider when you're when

899
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,150
you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Google car and</font>

900
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,430
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about you know where are</font>

901
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,430
we going with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this and how far</font>

902
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:59,979
have we gone already and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do</font>

903
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:02,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really think that it's in the future</font>

904
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:04,808
or do you really think it's today this

905
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:06,609
is where the policies and laws and

906
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:09,930
governance haven't kept up and our

907
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:12,578
leadership is struggling to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep up but</font>

908
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">innovation is happening faster than what</font>

909
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:18,729
they can keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even when when</font>

910
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:20,919
Amazon came out in December of 2014 and

911
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:24,038
they said okay we want to start

912
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,720
delivering packages with drones and they

913
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,089
went to the government they said we're

914
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,118
serious about this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bought</font>

915
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:33,880
the company so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon owns that company</font>

916
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,440
so when they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the government said</font>

917
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,479
we want to be able to do this the

918
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,239
government said<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely we love the</font>

919
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:43,299
idea in three to five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

920
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:48,039
consider what we need to do in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

921
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:51,190
years in order to be able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it dekh</font>

922
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:53,589
li well they're also flying in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada so</font>

923
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:55,269
so Amazon basically went back to the

924
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:57,460
government six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and said no</font>

925
00:52:55,269 --> 00:52:59,680
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this the government</font>

926
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:03,069
said again in three to five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

927
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">will consider it great they said we're</font>

928
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:07,599

958
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:00,430
this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real company this is</font>

959
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,079
actually really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and they have</font>

960
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:06,470
multiple of these drones and they're

961
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:08,960
also flying them for mountain rescue and

962
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,578
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

963
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,309
certain things like you've got people

00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:14,930
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up trapped on mountains what's</font>

965
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,700
the you know what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why they</font>

966
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:19,308
end up dying up there most the time it's

967
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,770
it's dehydration or they freeze to death

968
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:23,420
a UAV simply goes up gives them the

969
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:27,140
provisions that they need in order to

970
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,760

stuff comes out there

992
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,349
we never have to worry about

993
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:32,700
p

994
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,700
what

995
00:56:51,360 --> 00:57:04,540
how long correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start moving into</font>

996
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,850
a direction where it's all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,390
we're not going to have a choice on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

999
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,700
other challenge though the two is again

1000
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,220
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff has made overseas when</font>

1001
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:26,529
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the idea of this stuff</font>

1002
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:28,990
being made overseas<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know exactly</font>

1003
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,430
so anyway the next revolution is coming

1004
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,529
that's really the knowledge revolution

1005
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:35,799
which is going to be created from the

revolution I'm being thrown off stage so

1008
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:44,350
make this really fast complexity theory

1009
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,990
really comes into and where this where

1010
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,660
this ends up for leadership comes down

1011
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:51,689
to the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complexity leadership</font>

1012
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,589
theory that the books written on

00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,440
nonlinear companies such as uber

1014

Facebook Amazon Amazon actually started

1015
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,700
as a linear company had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship to</font>

1016
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,620
nonlinear but every company that has

1019
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,190

you need to buy this bottle of water at

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that again tomorrow and</font>

again the next day is that going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

you success no guess what is proven that

00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,360
you will fail and it's proven<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

have to use nonlinear thought process

does today in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get where you</font>

the government ideas on how drone issues

00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:47,140
and the integration into the nation

1035
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,390
there's a shifting knowledge base one of

1036
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:52,480
the challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that most</font>

1037
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:54,819
folks in this room look at the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1038
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were told by our parents or our</font>

1039
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:01,010
teachers that this was the way it was we

1040
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:03,109
were told that this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to</font>

1041
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:05,270
laundry or the way to think about

1042
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:07,220
something today kids don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

1043
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:09,650
that way they look in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonlinear</font>

non authoritarian self-organized entity

1045
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:14,780
approaches so now when you tell them to

1046
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:17,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">do the laundry by separating whites from</font>

1047
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:19,190
colors they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet and they</font>

1048
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,780
find out that Maytag actually says you

can put them both in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same bin and</font>

1050
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,400
you just use clorox all color bleach and

1051
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,890
you're good right now you've just been

1052
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">just proven by the internet so they're</font>

1053
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,850
going to shift in how they think and

1054
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,470
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> their knowledge based on where</font>

they get their knowledge from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet age and globalization's forever</font>

1057
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:41,210
change this equation the challenge that

1058
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have with there is that knowledge</font>

1059
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:46,130
transfer is what we used to call

1060
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:49,520
teaching we're not transferring the

1061
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:51,850
knowledge fast enough either so again

1062
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,530
future just distributed architecture

1063
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:56,120
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I've gone through with all</font>

1064
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">these different technologies that are</font>

1065
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,710
out there right now how they're going to

1066
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,359
play together and how we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1067
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and creating laws</font>

01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,090
actually understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to</font>

1070
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:11,569
mean as they all start to play together

1071
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:16,940
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving it in directions is the</font>

1072
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:21,470
last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple I've seen your boyfriend</font>

spinning a little all you try to seduce

1076

me think you can get this is my dress sm

1077

your projection will enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> your toe box</font>

1078
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:37,690
on everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everywhere imagines a</font>

01:00:43,590 --> 01:01:07,990
no some de BTW has my assistants you are

1081
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:12,940
we must come by yourself don't know this

1082
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is why i created ah the perfect action</font>

1083
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:20,500
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind i consider that videos we</font>

1084
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:22,630
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give up more and more freedoms</font>

1085
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,820
and start to give up more and more our

1086
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:27,840
own abilities to control our live

1087
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:31,750
control our data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control where we go</font>

1088
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:33,730
so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm now going to jump off stage</font>

1089
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:37,390
since i am over time I know you can't

1090
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:40,390
imagine that I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> freshman Nichols is</font>

01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:43,120
here he is a professor an adjunct

<font color="#CCCCCC">University he has written he's actually</font>

his<font color="#E5E5E5"> very thick books on wireless</font>

1096
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,880
security and he's a cyber expert as well

1097
01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:00,430
as an unmanned systems expert and we

1098
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,550
work together on on a board and if I

1099
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever get enough time I owe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him a chapter</font>

1100
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:12,250
to a book i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at maze-like yes</font>

1101
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:13,750
actually you do so i grandi come come on

1102
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:16,980
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to talk to you about</font>

1103
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,980
the cyber issues
