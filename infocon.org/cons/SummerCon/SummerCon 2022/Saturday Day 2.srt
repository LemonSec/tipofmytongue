1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,399
that is broken too because we have to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,760
const

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
put a context to every request if you

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,120
ask a document which you have perfect

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,480
access to

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,280
and it access the document itself is is

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,079
willing so that there's no restriction i

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,840
would say that's okay

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
but if you do the same request two in

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
the morning hundred times over from

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
china it should be a red flag we should

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
always look every request in the context

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
of the everything around including

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,679
policy everything we know about you as a

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,000
user account everything we know as a

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,079
process everything we knew about the

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,559
device and everything we know about the

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,640
asset class

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,920
so we are today in a situation where

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
everything we today use

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
as the fundamentals as a cornerstones of

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
security should be reevaluated in the

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,520
eyes of a zero trust and in zero trust

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,199
now understanding

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
which is not on a slide zero trust is

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
not a one thing it's a very important

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,239
thing it's it's it's

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
also bastardized by saying zero trust is

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
a journey most importantly zero trust is

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,799
an umbrella term

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,760
for a family a a set

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
of paradigm changes in security and

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
we are going to be having a a

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
evolution we are going to be changing

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
what zero trust means over the years and

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
very sort rapid pace because we are

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
changing the thinking first

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
so instead of perimeter defense instead

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
of wall garden now it's all about the

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
production of crown jewels and crown

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,560
jewels again is redefined because crown

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
jewels are not anymore necessarily only

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
digital assets they are a combination of

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
anything data files

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,799
streaming whatever digital asset is the

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
workflows the workloads the apis the

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
processes all of those are digital

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
assets they are now interesting that you

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
see there's no mention here about server

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
there's no mention about user

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
there is no mention about any of the

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
models we are looking today

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
because we no longer look into security

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,239
from from a location network logical or

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
physical location we don't look it from

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
how you are are a assumed to be in safe

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
place if your local network you are no

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
longer anymore a trusting vpn to give

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
you a secure access

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
so we have to

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
element all of that and start from the

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
identity start all over

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
and again since we are now looking the

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,920
wartime era we are looking in a cyber

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
war

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
that puts a new emphasis to open source

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
open standards and interoperability

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
because we cannot anymore live in a

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
world where you are locked to one vendor

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,920
and you have one vendor which is your

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
identity provider

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
and if you have to interoperate with

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
another entity provider

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,200
you

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,319
are

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
in like a better word fact no you have

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
to have an ability to

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
port and interact with identities

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
provided by completely isolated systems

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
systems you cannot trust again xero

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
trust is about not trusting anything

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
including your source code including

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
your network including your servers and

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
including the identities

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
so it's a cult rush

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
and it's good to remember and think

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
about why this

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
evolving term started this term started

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
from two things bring your own disaster

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
also called bring your own device

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,560
allowing enterprise networks to be

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
blended with the devices which are no

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
longer owned

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
operated controlled

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
and have a very little visibility no

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
matter what kind of endpoint security

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
you want to put you don't know anymore

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
your endpoint and that's one part where

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,519
zero trust

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
sales guys go wrong because they claim

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,959
that zero trusts is is giving you the

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,560
endpoint security

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
you cannot actually trust that so you

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
have to understand that's not there of

105
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
course we are in a hybrid cloud

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
environment where the network is also

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
edgeless

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
because part of your service might be in

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
your data center your your physical

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
premises party are in cloud and of

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
course the extent of this is

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
microservices kubernetes and epimerial

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
services so you have instances whose

114
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
lifetime

115
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
might be anything from seconds to days

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
but they are not permanent instances so

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
you have to be probably you have to be

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
able to provision security in an

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
environment where your instance

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
have a a unknown lifetime

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
one people who are my heroes in this

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,840
area is netflix and their monkey squad

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
because they have a security system

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
which is based on a

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,199
set of programs which is called monkey

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,960
squad who is randomly ruin your

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,840
production environment by killing

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
instances so it forces your programmers

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
to be and developers to know that your

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
process serving a real customer can die

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
anytime and it has to be able to to

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,600
tolerate that and spin over

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
of course covey change everything

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
because now everything we knew about

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
heuristics went out of the window all of

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,919
a sudden we no longer can use our

137
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,880
historical data about user behavior our

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
network behavior any of that because

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,840
everything changed in that an ukraine

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,479
war has brought us both new data but

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
also new threat models

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
one of the things i i love was two weeks

143
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
ago when a re-evil who has been

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
unaligned

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
crime organization

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
the russian

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
prosecutors told that they are

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
told publicly that they are striking a

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
deal with the re-evil so the re-evil

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
will start working for russia and that's

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
why that's how they avoid prosecution if

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,039
we look before that lapses who has been

153
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
a extortion gang and definitely saying

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
we are not aligned with with the russian

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
interest they announced on the day three

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
i think of the war that they will be

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
attacking and they consider anything

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
against russian interest or supporting

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
ukraine as a legit target

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
and

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
as a response

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
someone from lapses

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
leaked 13 months of their internal uh

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
instant messaging services and

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,479
conversation and about 450 000 files

166
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,319
massive amount of information which we

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
haven't had before which only showed a

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
few things immediately first of all it

169
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
seems to be that lapses services servers

170
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
were hiding in in lithuania how it's

171
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
possible that those servers are hiding

172
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
in nato country and nobody knew

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
it's a small network

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
so it's a mystery at the time

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
that's one thing the second thing what

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,000
it was even more revealing is uh it

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
seems to be the lapses actually was not

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
working directly with the intelligent

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
services modern ad-hoc basis but they

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
had direct relationship to kreml

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
so we understand now that the crime has

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
become distributed and

183
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
less

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,359
structured than it used to be

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
so we need to really go through

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
and this is not we

187
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
only as a secretary practitioners but

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
also governments rethink what it what we

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
have learned since the current

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,440
environment started

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
what do we what we need to think about

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
philosophically how we need to redefine

193
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
based on what we have today what zero

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
trust needs to be addressing and also

195
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
even more building ourselves a ready to

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,479
address a new other services new attack

197
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
vectors going forward

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
so while we are fighting a call for us

199
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
and i'm saying fighting by vendors

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
taking the money and not being helpful

201
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
in security we also are in a situation

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
where we are

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
starting to implement we are trying to

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
figure out our way to to a path which we

205
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
know that the path will take many turns

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
going forward

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
so this is the standard which

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
we are all looking at a special

209
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,479
publication 800-207

210
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
the thing i want to point out here

211
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,680
immediately

212
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
is first of all it is that the draft are

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
2019-20

214
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,759
and the final version is in august so

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
coronavirus and ukraine war absolutely

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
unforeseen in this document's history

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,759
the second part

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
is about the translation to japan and

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,200
etc this is a nice document this is not

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
standard for which only is for united

221
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,200
states this is for international

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
community and especially western

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
countries so the impact of this document

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
is far more reaching than just a united

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,240
states and united states government and

226
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
rise

227
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,880
the document why this speech is what it

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
is is here

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
on the may 12 2021

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
biden's white house issued an execute

231
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,760
order

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,920
a

233
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
14028

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
the executive order on improving nations

235
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
cyber security

236
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
it's a long document it has many twists

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
and turns as always are

238
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,000
but the most important thing is it sets

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
at deadlines it stays a a a unusual

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,839
read this

241
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
partly between the lines sometimes in

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
the line one thing is usually when when

243
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
the federal government is issuing an

244
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
order it is for federal government only

245
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
this document is calling a widespread

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
cooperation between private sector and

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
public sector so this is already

248
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
extending that also unlike a lot of

249
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
other documents of this time this has a

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
hard deadline so it started with a

251
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,240
series of hard deadlines what has to

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,839
happen and at what time

253
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,360
frame it comes with a little bit of

254
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
carrot and stick

255
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,600
and if keratin stick was formalized when

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
this document came out

257
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
this is from the january 26th this year

258
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,399
which is the

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,760
federal

260
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
strategy towards moving u.s united

261
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,279
states government towards zero trucks

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
architecture

263
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
this document has a little bit more a

264
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
teeth

265
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
so to speak and this document is now

266
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,839
being used by a number of other

267
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,079
governments called also european union

268
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,480
so similar documents are drafted all

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,839
around the world

270
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,399
and if i summarize what these documents

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,880
are saying it basically says if you want

272
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
to do business with our government

273
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
or you are supplying to a company which

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
is supplying to our government and

275
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
government now is plural it's not the

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
u.s it's it's england it's france it's

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
germany then you comply with this

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
before end of the budget year 2024

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,279
if you are not complying by 2024 gives

280
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,240
your business goodbye

281
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
very simple you have transition period

282
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
you have deadlines but you have an

283
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
ultimate deadline and if you think about

284
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
governments in plural that means every

285
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
fortune 500 company in the world every

286
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
major subcontractor for these companies

287
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
this is a wide track net thrown over

288
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
everybody who is doing anything which

289
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,880
has

290
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
cyber security implications

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
the strategy published look like that i

292
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
i strongly recommend this is only 29

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
pages

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
i strongly recommend this document

295
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
because it outlines

296
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
everything you need to know at this

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
point of time by the way there's already

298
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
another document which came out later

299
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
after this but this is outlining where

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
we are going

301
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
it is not only

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
zero trust

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
but it puts a strong emphasis on a

304
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
software supply chain

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
and the way it defines software supply

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,200
chain

307
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,639
is

308
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,200
if you read it you see that open source

309
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
is preferred answer

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
you are not actually banned for

311
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,079
propriety code

312
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
but if you read it you understand why

313
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
open source and open standards and open

314
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
is now the definition of how you

315
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
implement xero trust and we will get

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
back to there's actually an open source

317
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
solution for this but

318
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,279
this is outlining what we are doing why

319
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,000
we are doing when we have to do it and

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,639
what are the border lines we have to go

321
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,639
obviously in 28 pages there's a lot more

322
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,920
but it is

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
state right here here in the first line

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
requiring agencies to meet specific

325
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
cybersecurity standards and obviously by

326
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
the end of physical year 2024 in order

327
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,160
to reverse government government's

328
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
deficits it is not in a page 29 it's

329
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
right here

330
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
and of course when you read and you find

331
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
how it ropes in private that is your

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,719
private business too

333
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,720
nist

334
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,519
has been the section four which is

335
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
outlining the deadlines what needs to

336
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,959
happen

337
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,240
is publishing a a

338
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
frequent report showing what has

339
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
happened this is unlike normal

340
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
government project this is a publicly

341
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
tracked you can know what is happening

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
when it's happening

343
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
i can tell you uh from a personal uh

344
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
experience that when the issue came out

345
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
on 26th the budget document less than

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,399
two weeks later we had a conference

347
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
calls for people working with the

348
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,680
governments

349
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
to prove their private companies

350
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
what needs to happen and why you are

351
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
already late if you haven't started

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
before this is your wake up call

353
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
end of 2024 budget financial year is

354
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
coming so soon

355
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,959
and you have a

356
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
humongous work to do

357
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
and you have multiple ways of comply

358
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
but you have to comply

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,360
and of course as everything works then

360
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
there's these reports coming so if you

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
go to nist again

362
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,600
this is the latest report uh the 24th of

363
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
may this year

364
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
everything is reported so you can see

365
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
what different industries are doing what

366
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
different areas and sub sectors uh

367
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
government there's a a lot of things

368
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,000
which happens under different agencies

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,839
and they are touching different areas

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,560
for example a critical infrastructure

371
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
but the most important thing is if

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,639
critical infrastructure again is not

373
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,680
only your electricity your water your

374
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
severe system critical infrastructure

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,480
also financial sector it's the hospitals

376
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
it's transportation and it is even a

377
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
olympics big

378
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
sports venues because those are

379
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
evacuation centers

380
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
and of course nuclear waste and all of

381
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
the usual suspects but the point is that

382
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
critically understanding how wide is the

383
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,040
definition of critical infrastructure

384
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
now helps you understand

385
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
how large is the the first net and then

386
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
what else is going again

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,680
if you are anywhere in a financial

388
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
sector you are probably part of this in

389
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
a very close loop

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,360
so what it means it's it's it really is

391
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,000
tokens tokens tokens everywhere

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
you start

393
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,519
with identities

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,160
and when you look at definition identity

395
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,040
uh

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
right now identity humans we are still

397
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,120
part of measurable part of identities

398
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
when we look going forward

399
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,000
we are going to go extinct

400
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
i'm going to be surprised if more than

401
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
0.1 of identities we are dealing in a

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
near future is humans

403
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
because we need identities to everything

404
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,880
in order to operate in a edgeless

405
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
and trustless world

406
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
so first you use through identities then

407
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
you authenticate the identities and of

408
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
course

409
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
hopefully you get to the authorization

410
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
but then when you already at the time of

411
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,000
constant contextualizing you have start

412
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,639
to have a auxiliary data coming in you

413
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
have to know the behavior model is how

414
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
you understand the context if you don't

415
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
know what is the behavioral model

416
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
so because we are no longer going to

417
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
have static rules everything is going to

418
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
be dynamic rule so we have to do the

419
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
contextual analysis before we even can

420
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,519
can issue privileges now once we

421
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,680
understand the context

422
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
that allows us to determine what is the

423
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,480
lowest possible level of privileges we

424
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,279
can give in order to let the requester

425
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
to complete whatever they want to do and

426
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
so the context is actually defining what

427
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
is the least privileges because the same

428
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
request by same user for same document

429
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,519
can be complied in different contexts

430
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
with a different amount of privileges

431
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
and again we always have to remember

432
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
that we assume that even when we have as

433
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,600
us give her privileges anything we have

434
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
done can turn evil and malicious any

435
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
given time

436
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
and hence we have to have an automated

437
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
generation of privileges at the earliest

438
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
possible time we don't trust

439
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,839
ever which means that also the

440
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,160
privileges are for yours only for the

441
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
minimum amount of possible

442
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,599
and the tokenization here is the only

443
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,359
way we can have any kind of structure

444
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,199
like this working it's not certificates

445
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
it's tokens but the question is even

446
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,839
when the tokens are signed the signing

447
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,799
of the documents again makes a

448
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
key management problem to be a big

449
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
problem but even if we solve this key

450
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
management the signing only prevents our

451
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
talking against manipulation it doesn't

452
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
protect us against a spoofing replay

453
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
attacks and everything so once we do the

454
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
tokens if we don't change how we think

455
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
we are doing ourselves this service

456
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,520
so this is the summarization why today's

457
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,400
world

458
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,080
is so different

459
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,039
than

460
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
what we are what how we are working

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,080
today

462
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,880
and

463
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
this is only how we define it today

464
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
two years from now if i ever speak about

465
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
this again which i unfortunately

466
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
probably need to

467
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,520
this side will be different we will have

468
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
so many new categories we need to add so

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
many new threats we need to address and

470
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
so many new out in the wild attacks we

471
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,559
need to deal with

472
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
and hopefully we don't have too many

473
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
wars and the cyber

474
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
warriors coming up with the new ideas

475
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
the fundamental problem is that we

476
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
humans are now a monkey brain which is

477
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
always afraid of dropping from the tree

478
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
we confuse a lot of fundamental terms

479
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
authenticated

480
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
and trusted being one of those things

481
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
today we literally

482
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,799
seem to be most of the time thinking

483
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
that once you are authenticated that

484
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,160
means you can be trusted dr evil is evil

485
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
even when we know it's him

486
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
and the main

487
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
question here is just because dr evil is

488
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
evil doesn't mean i don't necessarily

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
want to speak with the evil i just have

490
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
to understand that by i knowing who he

491
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
is doesn't change his nature he's always

492
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
going to be evil

493
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
and all of these attacks when we think

494
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,840
about tokens tokens are expensive

495
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,559
computationally

496
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,240
because you need to have an encryption

497
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
you need to have a continuous validation

498
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
you have all of these so there's a lot

499
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,679
of temptations

500
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,320
to make it a little bit easier a little

501
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
bit

502
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
is the jitter is the latency is all of

503
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,080
that

504
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
and only thing what you do when you ease

505
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
it up is that you open yourself to

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
approve force attacks

507
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
so you have to always remember

508
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
that in zero test world

509
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,080
make

510
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
make a note every single time when you

511
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
make a concession every single time you

512
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
make it a little bit easier for yourself

513
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
document why you are doing it so that

514
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
you understand what are the assumptions

515
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,039
you've done if you need to revisit and

516
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,600
revaluate what you're doing or if

517
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,760
there's a preach and somebody comes to

518
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,480
knock your door and asking politely

519
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
about your personal liability policy

520
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
then you also want to have this

521
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
nice document saying well at the time

522
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
this was reasonable decision at the time

523
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,360
i did best i can

524
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,559
trust is a fiction also because and this

525
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,400
is a few slightly about a

526
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
the philosophy before we jump into a

527
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,039
possible solutions and and wrap up

528
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,919
so in the zero trust world we always got

529
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,000
into a question how the enemy is

530
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,039
thinking

531
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,799
and

532
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,600
most of the people

533
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
don't know how the enemy thinks they

534
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,039
claim i i i'm thinking like the enemy

535
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
but it means only that i'm thinking as i

536
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,440
wish my enemy would be thinking

537
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,039
enemies are enemies because we don't

538
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
have a agreement with the enemy

539
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,919
the enemy can do whatever they want and

540
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
yeah sometimes they even do things we

541
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
don't like that's why they are enemies

542
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
but enemies also in their own mind are

543
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,679
always the good guys as we are so we

544
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
have fundamental conflict no one of us

545
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
whether you're a criminal serial killer

546
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
you're stealing

547
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
the assets online or you're defending

548
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
the fort everybody

549
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
walks through the mirror and lies to

550
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
ourselves saying i'm the good guy in

551
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,039
this picture

552
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
that's why critical thinking is very

553
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
hard because it's very hard to admit

554
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
that that paradox

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
how we are always

556
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,880
deceiving ourselves in order to preserve

557
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
our fragile own ego and our fragile or

558
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,120
psychology or explain ourselves why our

559
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,720
actions are reasonable when they are not

560
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
critical thinking also

561
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
going away

562
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
it's very unnatural for us we humans are

563
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
so successful species because we build

564
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
communities communities are built on

565
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
trust

566
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,400
hence we are always inherently

567
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
trusting people to eat

568
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
next to us because that's how you build

569
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,039
communities that's how business works

570
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,200
and we are right now talking that our

571
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
monkey brain is wrong

572
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,120
there's the other part is that our

573
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,760
monkey brain is actually capable of

574
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,159
handling about 200 identities around us

575
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,760
after that it becomes fragile and

576
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,000
fragile and fragile so we don't even

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
recognize in today's world of social

578
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,280
media

579
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,799
gatherings how many of us are in

580
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,679
a silver conflict to our brain we see

581
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
and know more people than we actually

582
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,559
can handle psychologically of course

583
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
once we get to

584
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,520
computer world and we go to that that

585
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,919
human thinking in a designer space is

586
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,240
expanding so even when a computer can

587
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
handle more than 200 people

588
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
now on 2009 entities we are still

589
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,280
expanding these wrong models

590
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,400
a friend of mine she once said

591
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
there's only 200 people in the world

592
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
rest are holograms this is really an

593
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,280
extension of that

594
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,200
so again

595
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
our systems our hardware today

596
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,720
has a flaw it inherently trusts user

597
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
maybe it's a science fiction

598
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
movies and whatnot we see it in a usb

599
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,320
you got your

600
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,200
bash bunny or your wrapper ducky to usb

601
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
it's over

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
your computer is trusting your usb

603
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,919
because it's thinking that's a user and

604
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
i love users users are cool dave

605
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
you have nothing to worry

606
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
refers to

607
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
the 2001 space movement

608
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,279
but at the same time same is software

609
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,039
same as in everywhere we

610
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
today still if you have physical access

611
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
to a server to computer the game is over

612
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
so clearly we are not designing our

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
computers anywhere near the zero trust

614
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
but we actually don't even think in the

615
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
terms of humans in this room zero trust

616
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
i have been saying number of times none

617
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
of you are my friends

618
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
you are my colleagues and i will check

619
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
if you are my friend every single time

620
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
we have a next beer because i want to

621
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
know are has things changed but the

622
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
whole concept of friendship in zero

623
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
trust world doesn't exist it's

624
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,678
friends are dead in zero trust world

625
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
so it's all about my mindset uh we are

626
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
in a world where we have a different

627
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,559
kind of consultants and

628
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
think thanks which are always trying to

629
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
tell us that

630
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
they can predict the future no they are

631
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
predicting the predictable future

632
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
predicting is really hard breaking

633
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
future is especially hard but the

634
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
biggest problem is

635
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,240
those are really only looking for a easy

636
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
to predict

637
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
surprises easier predict future because

638
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
that's how you get money

639
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,640
if you are even in that business having

640
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,039
an idea which is unpredictable you are

641
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,600
setting yourself financially in the

642
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,400
difficult

643
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
situation and as the old joke goes give

644
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
man a zero day and he will have access

645
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,520
for a day and teach man to fist he will

646
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
access for life humans we are always the

647
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
weakest link

648
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,360
we are always the weakest link in

649
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,720
security so when we look this world we

650
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,360
look the the fact that your adversary

651
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
your enemy

652
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
is always going to think that they are

653
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
the good guy and then they are

654
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,559
exploiting your humans and your

655
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
computers and your systems are trusting

656
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,760
the human

657
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
where does it end and that's where zero

658
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,520
trust thinking has to be very different

659
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
than today you have to be questioning

660
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,080
the humans and of course in the hr in

661
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,200
the function of society in a function of

662
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,039
we need to work together

663
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,880
people don't like people who are

664
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
questioning their friends and that's

665
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,840
absolutely what we need to do

666
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,279
because otherwise

667
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,919
we are just going to have a situation

668
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,760
where everything we build

669
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
everything we do is going to be

670
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,760
circumvented by our adversary

671
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,799
because

672
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,279
they are circumvented by human factor

673
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,240
so

674
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
zero trust is not technology zero trust

675
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,279
is a philosophy and the philosophy is

676
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
never ending and if you don't change

677
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
your thinking

678
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,320
and you implement just the software

679
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
which is available you are probably

680
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
going to make a disservice to your

681
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,799
security

682
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
as always said that uh you shouldn't be

683
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
talking about problem without offering

684
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
any kind of solution so that's the last

685
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
12 minutes is going to be touching the

686
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
base of

687
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,320
what can solve this i uh

688
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,200
in a

689
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
interest of disclosure i'm a head of

690
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
security of ori i don't know what i'm

691
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
doing my job is so secret i don't even

692
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
know what

693
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
so i don't even that's not even my

694
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
official title because i don't think i

695
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
have official title but in a placeholder

696
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
i i'm worrying about the executive

697
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,000
orient ori is a only today existing open

698
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,799
source uh fully verifiable

699
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,440
software system to allow you to

700
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,679
implement certain elements of sirotas

701
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,360
not all and i will go through what it

702
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,080
can do and what it cannot do so you get

703
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
some idea and also these github links

704
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,000
are the links where you can find the

705
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
source code and all of that but just to

706
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
give you an idea what size of

707
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
communities ori uh it's uh last time

708
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,039
when i checked it was 440

709
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,480
494 contributors

710
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
uh

711
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,760
262 million docker pools a little bit

712
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,080
over today so massive amount of docker

713
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,159
bills obviously nobody knows who what

714
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,919
they are used for because a lot of that

715
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,080
is self-hosting

716
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,360
over 20 39 000 github stars

717
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,399
and then

718
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
ori has also optionally you can

719
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
self-host everything but if you don't

720
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,159
want to self-hosting you want to use

721
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,799
oracle cloud the orac cloud as of today

722
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,360
has served 610

723
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,120
billion requests

724
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
so it's quite of infrastructure

725
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,960
the different elements of the

726
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,679
system an open source kratos which is an

727
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,120
api uh only a logging platform so it's

728
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
everything what i'm going to talk about

729
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,039
now when it's not cloud it's headless so

730
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,279
this everything is headless and these

731
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,640
are different elements which you can

732
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,399
pick and choose if you want

733
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
and the open source so they are free of

734
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,559
charge if you want to do it yourself i'm

735
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,799
not selling this this is a i'm

736
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,240
explaining what the open source

737
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
solutions are so instead of a having a

738
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,919
open source white wasp by open source

739
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,799
sdk the whole core is is in permissible

740
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,840
license

741
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
but this basically allows you to do

742
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,679
everything what you need to do in a

743
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,720
normal

744
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
a logging world because why would you

745
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,600
actually want ever to define a write

746
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,440
your own login again

747
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,399
if we look all the flaws everything from

748
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,880
sql inject to all the things going wrong

749
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
in the social logging and social looking

750
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
actually adding the complexity and we

751
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
think about how the password list flows

752
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,320
why would you ever want to write your

753
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,200
own login again if you can just pull it

754
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,320
from github and run it as it is or pull

755
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
it from docker if you don't want to do

756
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
that

757
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
so this guy does what kratos is doing

758
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,559
hydra is again headless

759
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
and this is an api only again and this

760
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
is providing you all different

761
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
interoperability interability with

762
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,279
different id providers so you can use

763
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,039
hydra without

764
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,880
kratos but you can also work them

765
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
together but you can use anything

766
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
without fido and open id i just listed

767
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,799
something you can plug your own you can

768
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,520
actually use this as a proxy

769
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,240
to

770
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,320
handle a ldap

771
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
call saml calls so this is just give an

772
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
idea how you if you have a legacy system

773
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
you need to implement

774
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
and or you want to build your own but

775
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
you need to integrate with your your

776
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,200
ecosystem this is allowing you to do all

777
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,679
of that

778
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
oathkeeper is the primary reverse proxy

779
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
networking proxy it's a sidecar for

780
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
ingress and api gateways

781
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,159
and the basic thing is you don't need to

782
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
when you use this you have all the

783
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,640
incoming requests authenticated and

784
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,039
performant in action so this is handling

785
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,760
your that part of the system again you

786
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
can use this independently from the

787
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,039
other modules

788
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,080
and this is

789
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,799
a key part here is of google sansibar

790
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,200
research paper so this is the first and

791
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
the leading open source implementation

792
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,279
google sansibar if you don't know what

793
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,679
bar is that will be another one hour but

794
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,760
it's one of those key

795
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
concepts which are in the open source

796
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
world and changing how we think about

797
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
managing identities and managing uh the

798
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
network traffic how we are managing the

799
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,159
permissions perspective and how we are

800
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,640
enforcing all of this

801
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,039
most importantly now comes the scale

802
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,000
once you are in a volumes as i showed

803
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,039
600 billion requests you need a serious

804
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
infrastructure to deal with the latency

805
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,279
and google actually the research paper

806
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
has been solving a lot of the problems

807
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,080
in theoretical layer how you are

808
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,519
managing the jitter and latency so a key

809
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
document to read if you're as a bethel

810
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
reading and this is the one

811
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,399
implementation of that and the first

812
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,440
implementation last but not least keto

813
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
which is a the another implementation of

814
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,559
that and handles the scalability and

815
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,960
authorization and permission service

816
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,279
so this is bringing into planet

817
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,559
landscape so my point here was just that

818
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,200
while i was passing the vendors uh there

819
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,279
are also open source solutions for this

820
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,919
space allowing you to participate

821
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,600
contribute

822
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
modify

823
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
help each other out or just do it

824
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
yourself uh

825
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,320
this is

826
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,720
what find all the bugs submit them make

827
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,279
it better exactly we have a bug bounty

828
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,480
program too

829
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,919
find the box

830
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,320
please

831
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,519
so

832
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,840
to wrap this up what what tells you

833
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,480
something is a snake coil snake oil is

834
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
the one where you say this is easy zero

835
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
trust is never going to be easy

836
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,919
zero trust is going to be adding

837
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
to your current infrastructure jitter

838
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,279
latency because of it's computationally

839
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
not cheap

840
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,399
if you are making it computationally

841
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,080
cheap you're probably cutting corner

842
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,519
with your token validation and you are

843
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,760
shooting yourself to head just

844
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
sorry you're dead

845
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
uh so you have to understand this is not

846
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,120
going to be easy or cheap if you do it

847
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,559
today's way

848
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,440
but at the same time this is a humongous

849
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,840
opportunity for cost saving

850
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,480
once you are rethinking your crown

851
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
jewels once you are identifying

852
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
what are your digital assets you

853
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
actually want to protect once you are

854
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,159
thinking about your workflows your work

855
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
payloads once you are thinking all of

856
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,200
that you can it's a easily identified

857
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,720
residences

858
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,440
in the perimeter defense which you don't

859
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
anymore need you will identify a cost

860
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,519
service everywhere

861
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,880
so

862
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,080
if you do the both steps if you look

863
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
both how to check yourself but then you

864
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,880
look your legacy systems it is highly

865
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,720
likely that you identify cost savings

866
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
and zero trust is not only going to be

867
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
making you more safe but actually going

868
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,000
to lower your cost function

869
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
and again it's not the project it's a

870
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,039
journey we don't know where it's going

871
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,960
to go we

872
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,120
absolutely certain only thing with this

873
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,880
certain is that this

874
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,360
talk is not going to age well it's going

875
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,279
to be outdated in hopefully two years

876
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,440
time beyond recognition because we are

877
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
looking for new attack services new york

878
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,360
vectors

879
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
but because of how the governments are

880
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,720
working in this area and how the

881
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,799
regulations working this is no longer

882
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,279
optional we know this is going to happen

883
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,360
we are we are now having the accelerated

884
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,640
actions from

885
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
number of governments both in the

886
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,639
western world in asia forcing us to do

887
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,800
this regardless whether we want or not

888
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
and at the same time i don't think we

889
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,079
have a better option today nobody has

890
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,280
come up with a new research paper

891
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
with that thank you and i'm open for

892
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,719
questions

893
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,118
all right

894
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,690
[Applause]

895
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,679
so my question is specifically about the

896
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,119
last statement you made which is that

897
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,839
it's not optional it's going to be

898
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,520
required considering that literally

899
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
nobody knows what zero trust is how are

900
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,879
they going to validate whether you're

901
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,879
doing zero trust or you just buy the

902
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,199
stake oil and you're good

903
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,800
you're absolutely right there's a there

904
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
is a compliance business there are

905
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,159
people who are selling you the snake oil

906
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
so that you can check the box

907
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,918
and they're happily taking your money

908
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,879
and they're walking away

909
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,159
well

910
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,040
so the the status quo is again since we

911
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
have a defined documents like the nist

912
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
208 or seven now we can actually go and

913
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
see is your current status quo

914
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
covered by this document

915
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
the one key thing which we don't know

916
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,520
today is how quickly uh cyber insurance

917
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,359
people and the financial sector who is

918
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,440
actually picking up the bill today for

919
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
all the bad behavior how quickly they

920
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
are going to be adapting

921
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,839
so

922
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
this is only the beginning of the

923
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
regulatory paradigm shift

924
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,359
we are right now talking

925
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,839
xero address more as how your ideology

926
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,960
has to change and how the cyber security

927
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,560
paradigms have changed we have we are

928
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,880
still yet to see outside the regulatory

929
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,960
space what are the ramifications

930
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
happening now

931
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,680
when

932
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,760
insurance company folks are suffering so

933
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,000
deeply from these flaws and they might

934
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,320
not want to be suffering in the future

935
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,520
so the answer is i don't know only thing

936
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,760
i can tell you is that if you want to

937
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
know whether you bought snake or not you

938
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,320
can

939
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,880
anything else

940
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,840
no thank you

941
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:16,319
[Applause]

m32c firmware and the lessons are

1001

learned uh while playing that with like

1002
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,280
a wheel architecture

1003

probably like a year i've do i did like

1015
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,680
volume research on an infusion pump

1016
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,200
you can see the blog it was like all the

1017
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
details and spoilers about the for the

1018
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,119
talk and that was a collaboration with

1019
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,920
doug mckee and my colleague

1020
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,040
the idea is when i started that research

1021
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,400
i had no idea what m32c was and so i

1022
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
learned a bunch of stuff and on top of

1023
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
that a good thing about m32c is that it

1024
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
has a lot of documentation

1025
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,319
and so uh

1026
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,560
in in many situations if you look at

1027
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
like hardware reverse engineering

1028
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
everything is under nda so it's hard to

1029
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
to figure it out

1030
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,640
but um

1031
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,160
this one has plenty of documentation so

1032
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,960
the idea is uh you can learn the

1033
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
principle with that one and maybe it's

1034
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,359
applicable for other devices in the

1035
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,800
future

1036
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
so how did it start

1037
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,880
uh that's a kind of pixelated picture of

1038
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
uh the infusion pump so it's called an

1039
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,920
infuser mat

1040
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
uh you would find that usually like uh

1041
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
in hospitals and it's used for like

1042
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,400
doing iv uh infusions

1043
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,640
for like pain management

1044
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,119
anesthesia chemotherapy that kind of

1045
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,000
stuff

1046
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,079
but you know we hardware hackers so it

1047
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
didn't stay like that for a long time

1048
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
and instead like here like you have it

1049
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
like split open and that's like on the

1050
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,359
left side you have the main circuit

1051
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,160
board

1052
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,240
and on the right side the same circuit

1053
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,000
board getting up nicely and cooked in

1054
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,400
the rework station and the point was to

1055
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,760
remove like the flash chip that would

1056
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,720
have the firmware of the device on it

1057
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
so basically what happened next was my

1058
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,640
colleague approached me with that chip

1059
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,079
which was still functional so that's

1060
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,480
nice and it was like is there code on

1061
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,359
that

1062
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,839
um what is on it you know and so if you

1063
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
look you can on the right side have like

1064
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,520
a firmware dump and you can see stuff

1065
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,839
like an old pointer string and so it's

1066
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,680
like you can have an idea that's here

1067
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,200
there's probably a code on that stuff

1068
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
right

1069
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,920
so you know you can eyeball

1070
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
the firmware and see like it looks like

1071
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
there is code on it

1072
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
you can also run an entropy analysis uh

1073
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,480
that's the the graph on on the on the

1074
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,839
bottom side

1075
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,119
on the right side

1076
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,920
uh and we can what you see is like it

1077
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,400
never reached one and so it means that

1078
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,760
you know there's like lower entropy than

1079
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
that so you can assume that it's not

1080
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,920
compressed not encrypted and we've seen

1081
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
we've seen strings so obviously like

1082
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,359
it's not encrypted

1083
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,960
um but then you can ask bin work you

1084
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,880
know what is it you know what's that

1085
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
stuff and bing work was like oh maybe

1086
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
it's mips maybe it's arm or even maybe

1087
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
it's arcadian i have no idea what

1088
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,359
arcadian is but that wasn't that

1089
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,119
and you can try to import that in either

1090
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,520
and start uh you know looking at it as

1091
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
telling either or that maybe mips that

1092
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
maybe arm but you really you just get

1093
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
like gibberish because it's neither mips

1094
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,960
nor arm

1095
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
so the next step is like well if you're

1096
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,280
smart you just read the label on on the

1097
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,920
chip and it says m32c but at that time i

1098
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,680
had no idea where it was and googling i

1099
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,440
think it didn't quite help on that

1100
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
so i kept searching and adding more

1101
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,480
keywords

1102
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
to my research and eventually i found

1103
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,560
that awesome document which is like a

1104
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,680
fda pre-market filing for the device so

1105
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,359
if you're like a medical device

1106
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,359
manufacturer and you want to push a new

1107
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,960
device on the market you have to um

1108
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,880
provide this like information for like a

1109
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,119
public preview or something and in those

1110
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,720
like really interesting details like it

1111
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,480
says for instance that or the

1112
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,560
microprocessor is like from nss so now

1113
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,640
we know it's a rnsm32c and it's better

1114
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,560
to google that and it even tells you

1115
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,480
like the operating system of the stuff

1116
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,560
we had in this case it's embossed

1117
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,319
and what programming language was used

1118
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,000
for it so it's a lot of information that

1119
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,680
we just find randomly in like a fda

1120
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,800
document

1121
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,800
so now we know it's a renaissance m32c

1122
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,960
and because of the power of google you

1123
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
know you can search even more for more

1124
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,359
stuff and you find uh data sheet and

1125
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,200
manuals which usually is pretty rare

1126
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,880
because most of the time like when you

1127
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,160
look at the funky chip it's going to be

1128
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,680
under nda

1129
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,960
so on the left side you have the data

1130
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,560
sheet that explains like the basics of

1131
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,960
the of the microcontroller in the center

1132
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,560
it's the software manual which is really

1133
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,240
nice because it gives you like all the

1134
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
assembly instruction and how to program

1135
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,839
it and so on and on the right side is

1136
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,839
the hardware manual which is even more

1137
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,119
interesting because it tells you about

1138
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,880
all the peripherals the timings and so

1139
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,440
on and that's extremely useful

1140
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,040
so there is going to be some assembly

1141
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,200
like in the slides so uh

1142
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,839
we are hanging there but um

1143
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,520
just to give you a idea of like how it

1144
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,000
works uh you have a bunch of registers

1145
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,560
r0 to r3 which are like 16 bits they can

1146
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,720
be combined two by two uh to form like

1147
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,800
32 bit registers addresses are 24 bits

1148
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,599
and they're stored in a0 a1 there is no

1149
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,040
virtual memory so like if you are

1150
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
looking at that this morning none of

1151
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,440
that in the system

1152
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,079
and you have uh in b which is going to

1153
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,400
store like a interrupt table that will

1154
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,640
be useful later and so technically this

1155
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
is a cisc instruction set so the c is

1156
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,119
for complex but really like it's just

1157
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,520
like a bunch of add move multiply return

1158
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,359
it's it's nothing too crazy

1159
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,440
um instruction goes left to right so

1160
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,240
it's like move 42 into r0 and that's not

1161
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
the opposite and there are more complex

1162
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
instructions but they're barely used in

1163
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the firmware and you can always read the

1164
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,079
the software manual for explanation of

1165
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,400
how they work

1166
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,079
so we always have this problem is like

1167
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,680
how do you import that in either so if

1168
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,119
you're like a reverse engineer and you

1169
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,440
have like you know like l files or p

1170
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,280
files like ida already knows how that

1171
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,079
works

1172
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,440
but in that situation that wasn't the

1173
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,680
case oh and before i forget like

1174
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,359
something really nice was we started

1175
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,599
this project and i was like oh i'm

1176
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,040
going to have to do like a like a

1177
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,720
processor um

1178
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,040
definition that's going to be awful

1179
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
lucky for me uh three months before the

1180
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
start of the project i just started

1181
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,960
supporting m32c

1182
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,319
80. the chip we have is like 83 but i

1183
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,560
was like oh probably good enough

1184
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,079
so that that's good we can import it in

1185
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
either but yeah what's the load address

1186
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,400
because as i said it's just like a dump

1187
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,119
like a raw firmware so there is no

1188
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,560
information about that

1189
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,880
usually what you do in this situation is

1190
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,480
you're going to look for like absolute

1191
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,520
addresses

1192
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,240
in the firmware and try to guess

1193
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,839
what would be the right loading address

1194
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,440
so that these absolute addresses would

1195
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,160
work so for instance if you have like a

1196
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,000
address of a string you would expect

1197
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,359
that when you find the right original

1198
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,200
address and you click on the thing it

1199
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
would lead to like the string

1200
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,319
but this time we're lucky because we

1201
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,160
have the datasheet so we can integrate

1202
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,800
the datasheet and see what it says

1203
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
so i found this like crazy diagram and

1204
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,680
like i had no idea which was the the mod

1205
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,839
or like the sub mods of the processor

1206
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,839
it's really complicated but like that's

1207
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,760
fine because we don't care about which

1208
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,839
mod it is it's just on the left side we

1209
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
can see like a bunch of addresses that

1210
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,760
like highlight where like memory range

1211
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,920
start or ends so that gives us a really

1212
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,480
good hint at what would be a good load

1213
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,079
address

1214
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,480
and there's another like diagram like in

1215
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
in the manual that says at the bottom of

1216
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,560
the memory map you know if you have it

1217
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,160
right you will find like a bunch of

1218
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
function pointers which are like reset

1219
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,119
vectors

1220
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,720
so you know that if you load the thing

1221
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,680
at the right address and you look at

1222
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,359
ffffe00 you will see function pointers

1223
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,040
so that's that's a good way of testing

1224
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
if you're right or not

1225
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,319
so i did it i tried e000 which was like

1226
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,160
mentioned on the previous slide and

1227
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,119
indeed at ff ffc we see

1228
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
like a bunch of function pointers and

1229
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,640
it's nice so we can like rename them

1230
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,839
because the

1231
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,400
datasheet tells us what they are so with

1232
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
that we are able to actually find what

1233
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,440
is the load address of the firmware

1234
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
and as a bonus

1235
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
stuff like if we look through the

1236
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,280
firmware there's like a bunch of

1237
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,079
references to the e0 range and basically

1238
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,839
like half of the memory map of that

1239
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,559
device is for like permanent storage so

1240
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,400
you know like configuration calibration

1241
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
that type of things and so all of those

1242
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,079
like addresses are like different chunk

1243
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,119
of data that are used by the device

1244
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,800
which was interesting and insight you

1245
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
know if looking at all these addresses

1246
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,760
we could be like oh maybe there's

1247
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
something interesting at e0 in the e0

1248
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,000
range

1249
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,400
uh that being said you know ida is not

1250
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,119
perfect uh that hurts me to say that but

1251
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,599
sometimes sometimes there are issues and

1252
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,160
in that case uh some of the instructions

1253
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,359
were not

1254
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,520
recognized properly by either

1255
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,200
which was eventually fixed like a couple

1256
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
of months later

1257
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
but so for instance here like you can

1258
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,280
see uh over there

1259
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,520
that works uh you can see like a bunch

1260
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,359
of undefined bytes

1261
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,079
and

1262
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,160
it's like oh what is that and so the

1263
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,000
trick here like you can convert that

1264
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,480
into like its binary representation and

1265
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,880
then like play the wuzu game uh in the

1266
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
software manual and eventually you find

1267
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,520
that that says oh this is a multiply

1268
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,240
instruction and uh all the bits that i

1269
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
haven't put in

1270
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,680
between like in the

1271
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,319
those bits here and here are actually

1272
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,920
like the one that specifies which

1273
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,160
operands we're looking at so in that

1274
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,040
case it's a multiply between r3 and r1

1275
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,640
and r2 r0 so here

1276
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,280
and for the trick like during my

1277
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,839
analysis i would just comment like you

1278
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,359
can see here i would comment the

1279
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
intended instruction and i just moved on

1280
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
there like not that many of those so it

1281
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,640
was not too much of a problem

1282
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,920
and if there were like many that could

1283
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,319
be automated

1284
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,160
so okay now we know how to get the stuff

1285
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,240
in either what do we do it's it's kind

1286
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,839
of like a time to get the layer of the

1287
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,599
land and try to understand find like uh

1288
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,359
interesting code patterns

1289
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,920
uh the first one was what are the call

1290
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,079
convention how do you call a function

1291
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,800
and how does a function returns

1292
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,720
i think it's kind of not

1293
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,319
architecture like dependent and it's

1294
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,839
more like arbitrary for like the

1295
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
operating system or the compiler

1296
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,920
and so just by observation we can see

1297
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,520
that most of the

1298
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,599
ap log of the functions would do

1299
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,520
something like putting something into r2

1300
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,240
r0 and then returning so

1301
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,920
through observation we can figure out

1302
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,880
that

1303
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,480
usually like r2 r0 or r2 r0 will

1304
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,760
have like the return value of the

1305
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,880
function

1306
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,400
and the same way we can look at for

1307
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,160
instance this lamp set here

1308
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,800
for calling a function what happens is

1309
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,119
you either put uh the first the first

1310
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,599
argument is going to go into either r0

1311
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,160
if it's a value or into a0 if it's an

1312
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,839
address and everything else is pushed

1313
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,000
onto the stack so for mem set here we

1314
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,240
can see that the the address is put into

1315
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,319
a0 the address of the buffer you mem

1316
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,720
setting and then like

1317
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
zero and to like the other parameters of

1318
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,800
the mems set are pushed onto the stack

1319
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
that being said it doesn't always work

1320
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,000
there are like these like hello

1321
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,839
functions or maybe anarchist function

1322
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:18,960
that doesn't follow like the call

1323
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,280
conventions and so for instance in that

1324
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,000
situation we can see uh that function

1325
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,520
falls directly into the next one and

1326
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,000
there is a bunch of side effects

1327
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
my assumption on that one is it's just

1328
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,079
optimization from the compiler

1329
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,160
which uh you know probably optimized for

1330
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,119
space

1331
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,119
and um and as a consequence it's just

1332
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,119
like it knows that

1333
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,720
you can modify certain registers and

1334
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,319
whatnot and it will not have like a bad

1335
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,040
consequence because it's you know

1336
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,440
like the compilers work

1337
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,680
but the idea is like be careful

1338
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,960
the ideas be careful because you know

1339
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
sometimes we make assumptions and

1340
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,680
they might be proved wrong

1341
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,359
so to give like an advice of like how to

1342
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,040
handle this type of stuff

1343
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,319
um

1344
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,040
one thing is like either can uh provide

1345
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,480
like typing information of like

1346
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,680
functions but it doesn't work on that

1347
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,079
microcontroller so the trick here was to

1348
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,680
do stuff like

1349
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,559
to rely heavily on comments so you can

1350
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,640
see here like like plenty of details to

1351
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,800
like spell out like each arguments what

1352
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,400
they are and how they work

1353
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,920
and at the same time you can also use

1354
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,280
repeatable commands uh with

1355
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,400
that key

1356
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,319
and that looks like that so the idea

1357
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,400
would be specify just the prototype of

1358
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,920
the function as a repeatable command so

1359
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,000
that when you read the disassembly it's

1360
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,839
much easier to read

1361
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,720
another fun one

1362
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,119
was like switch statements so i think in

1363
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,119
x86 and and that kind of stuff usually

1364
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,720
you have like a nice switch table and

1365
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,800
ida knows how to recognize that but in

1366
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,640
this situation that's not the case and

1367
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,079
they have actually like a specific

1368
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,840
function that's invoked to

1369
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,119
[Music]

1370
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,359
implement like the switch behavior so

1371
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,520
that's the call switch function there

1372
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
and the idea is that it takes one

1373
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
parameters would be like the switch

1374
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,520
table and like the other like parameter

1375
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,359
would be which value you want to like

1376
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,800
switch on

1377
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,880
so as i said i don't recognize that and

1378
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,280
i don't think you can trick either into

1379
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,000
fixing it automatically by uh

1380
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,680
asking it to like declare like switch

1381
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,119
properly instead um i choose to use like

1382
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,119
either python to kind of like clean up

1383
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,359
the code automatically by finding all

1384
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,440
the switches and creating commands in

1385
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,200
the basic block

1386
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,440
associated with the switch

1387
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,640
and

1388
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,800
so to give you an id that's one of the

1389
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,280
uh switch table and we can see here that

1390
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,960
has like the number of entries and then

1391
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,280
you have that many entries which are

1392
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,599
like the value of uh

1393
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,599
like the value of the entry and the

1394
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,520
basic block associated with that

1395
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,800
and at the end you have also like

1396
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
default case for you switch if neither

1397
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
match

1398
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
the switching function uh the the switch

1399
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,760
function

1400
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,119
uh pretty simple uh you know it takes r0

1401
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,720
is the value you want to switch and a0

1402
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,319
is the address of the switch table and

1403
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,160
we can see like it's going to read the

1404
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,839
first entry which is the number of

1405
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,079
entries uh the first value sorry which

1406
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,359
is the number of entries and then it's

1407
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,240
going to iterate over like the table and

1408
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,319
try to see if it matches uh like the

1409
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,920
value you've provided and if so it will

1410
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,000
break and eventually jump

1411
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,079
into the deposit block

1412
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,599
nothing too crazy

1413
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,240
here um

1414
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,680
so how that i wanted to share the

1415
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,559
scripts to actually like do the cleanup

1416
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,319
uh i think it was like i wrote that like

1417
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,160
a while ago so it's python 2. i'm sorry

1418
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,680
but

1419
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,319
but anyway the idea here is you find

1420
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,040
like all the cross reference to

1421
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,800
the switch function

1422
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,119
and then uh you can like iterate

1423
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,520
backwards to find to look at previous

1424
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,920
instructions so that's used with the

1425
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,880
heads uh function from ida

1426
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,119
and then you uh get the

1427
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,440
kind of like show delete get the

1428
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,520
the content of the assembly line and if

1429
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,920
it's moving something into a zero it's

1430
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
the it's the address of the switch table

1431
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,079
uh so that's nice you can this way you

1432
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,440
can recover like all the addresses of

1433
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,800
the switch tables

1434
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,119
and then you can process that

1435
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,680
with the function the next slide

1436
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,160
so how do you process this switch table

1437
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,880
so first you get the number of entries

1438
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,280
then a trick is to like undefine the

1439
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,440
whole chunk of entries because

1440
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,240
those are mixed with code and either

1441
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,400
might get confused and try to

1442
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,359
decode that as uh actual code and so if

1443
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,960
it's poorly defined it's going to be

1444
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,480
like a problem so that's why you like

1445
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,720
kind of like undefined everything

1446
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,480
and then you i trace over like all of

1447
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
the instructions

1448
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
create like words for the entry and

1449
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,960
offset for the um

1450
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,920
for the basic block and uh then you

1451
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,000
create like a comment which

1452
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,440
is going to give you like this nice like

1453
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,240
little like entry here for instance and

1454
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,640
finally you also like mark the the basic

1455
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,359
block as code and this because uh

1456
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,760
either may have missed a random chunk of

1457
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,799
codes because they were like not

1458
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,559
referenced anywhere and so this way like

1459
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,839
it cleans up also like the

1460
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,880
disassembly that's why it looks in the

1461
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,680
end uh it's not perfect like

1462
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,599
the the call switch here has like only

1463
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,760
one edge while like proper switch would

1464
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,839
have like all the edges and you have

1465
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,440
like those blocks like kind of floating

1466
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,040
in the function but that's kind of good

1467
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,280
enough like for like reversing like you

1468
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,480
you read the stuff and make sense

1469
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,760
uh another fun one was logging function

1470
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,400
so the way it works is there is one

1471
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
generic logging function that takes a

1472
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,880
module name and a line number

1473
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,359
and you know when there is a like a bug

1474
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,119
or something it will lock the modules

1475
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,599
and line number but what happened is

1476
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,480
each module is extending this log

1477
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,960
function by implementing their own like

1478
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,640
local function that's going to hard code

1479
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,040
the module name so in this example like

1480
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,799
log heap has like hard coded the the hip

1481
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,119
string and called the generic function

1482
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,960
so if we cross reference

1483
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
the log this log function we can see

1484
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,880
there is like 255 of them so that's a

1485
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,040
lot so it's going it could be used to do

1486
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,200
that by hand so we can also automate the

1487
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,799
renaming

1488
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,960
of the functions

1489
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,119
so that's the the code for doing that

1490
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,880
the idea is like once again you get all

1491
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,839
the cross references you get the the

1492
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,480
like the the the string

1493
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,480
and then you just rename it and that's

1494
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,359
nice because it creates it's uh when

1495
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,280
when you read the code it makes it

1496
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,720
becomes much easier because if a

1497
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,640
function calls like logib for instance

1498
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,559
you know that it's a hip function

1499
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,960
so it gives context to like the the

1500
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,160
reversing you're doing and that's really

1501
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,920
helpful

1502
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,160
uh and second thing also like really

1503
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,319
interesting is there is like low quality

1504
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,119
in the code so the ideas like function

1505
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,799
belonging to the same module are going

1506
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,880
to be next to each other and on top of

1507
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,480
that because we're really lucky the

1508
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,920
first function of the module is going to

1509
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,359
be this log function

1510
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,400
so

1511
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,000
if we look from like one log function to

1512
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,599
the next log function we know that all

1513
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,359
the functions in between belong to that

1514
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,200
module so we can even if we want to

1515
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,760
rename all the unknown functions with

1516
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,400
them at least module name so that when

1517
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,000
you reverse some random piece of code

1518
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,680
you don't have to

1519
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,359
you know go many function dips you can

1520
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,599
just oh that's a database or something

1521
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,200
and you just move on

1522
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,280
so that's really nice

1523
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,599
and other like funky thing in the code

1524
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,200
layout so that's the whole

1525
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,319
memory

1526
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,119
memory view of the code the whole like

1527
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,520
khaki part green wheel green

1528
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,559
is data so that's all the

1529
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,720
permanent storage on the flash so

1530
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,119
configuration calibration and so on and

1531
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,359
everything else is code we can see

1532
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,599
but the fun stuff is here there is a

1533
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,799
there's a gap

1534
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,160
and then there is something else more

1535
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,240
code here and just by observation we can

1536
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,760
be like why is it where is there gap

1537
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,440
what's going on here and if you look at

1538
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,000
this code it's actually a different

1539
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,280
piece of code which is kind of like a

1540
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,480
bootloader

1541
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,359
and

1542
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,559
further in the research i realized it's

1543
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,720
called like monitor code in the in the

1544
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,119
parents of the m32c but so we can see

1545
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,960
just by observing like the memory layout

1546
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,559
that we have a big chunk of code which

1547
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,240
is the main application and then just

1548
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,839
like a tiny thing that's a bootloader

1549
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:08,799
and that might be interesting to

1550
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,440
investigate as well

1551
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,079
so what we learned so far

1552
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,319
don't be scared of like random assembly

1553
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,240
it's like if you know like x86 or arm

1554
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,839
it's all the same stuff

1555
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,520
google is awesome because you can find

1556
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,280
lots of documentation and random stuff

1557
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,240
like this fda filing

1558
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,839
sometimes the tools you're using have

1559
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,599
limits and you know

1560
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:30,799
you need to be aware of that so that

1561
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,559
once they like

1562
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,960
mess up you can recognize that and

1563
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,640
figure out how to

1564
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,799
circumvent that situation

1565
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,480
uh ida python is awesome for like

1566
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
automating like all the tds work

1567
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,799
and compiler can be funky in the sense

1568
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,200
of you know sometimes it's good

1569
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,640
for like the code locality i was talking

1570
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,400
about sometimes it's bad when it breaks

1571
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,240
your assumptions

1572
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,839
and firmware address usually you're

1573
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,319
going to find it like a round number so

1574
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,040
at least like page lines but who knows

1575
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,200
and you could expect to find interrupt

1576
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,720
vectors or like function pointers and

1577
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,160
stuff either at the beginning of it or

1578
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,680
like in that case at the end so that's

1579
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,480
always a good place to look at that

1580
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,319
okay so we're looking at an embedded

1581
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,920
device so let's talk about like embedded

1582
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,559
stuff right

1583
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,480
what's really interesting is

1584
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,040
the peripherals of the device it's kind

1585
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,280
of like how the the the pump and the

1586
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,720
firmware like talk with the outside

1587
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,599
world

1588
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,599
so as if you wanted to run research on

1589
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,440
that it's always interesting to to

1590
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,280
investigate that because you know you

1591
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,799
want to know how it talks with the rest

1592
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,920
of the world because you're going to

1593
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,200
come from that

1594
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,480
you're going to come from the outside

1595
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,079
the world talking to the device so

1596
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,839
that's like the uart so like serial

1597
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,319
communication the can bus

1598
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,280
usually you would find that in

1599
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,720
automotive but for some reason they're

1600
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,359
using it for like communication as well

1601
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,359
you can also find like tons of io pins

1602
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,280
for like you know flipping a led or like

1603
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,760
debug debug pins i don't know

1604
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,319
uh analog to digital and digital to

1605
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,319
analog converters so i think those are

1606
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,359
like more interesting for like

1607
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,559
understanding like physical process

1608
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,319
you know like reading like a pressure

1609
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,319
sensor for instance

1610
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,000
and how you find those

1611
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,920
uh it's like two ways uh interrupt

1612
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,280
handlers and special functional

1613
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,480
registers

1614
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,640
which we're going to see now

1615
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,400
so in short vector table

1616
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,040
there's like two of them in this device

1617
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,960
one at a fixed location that's what we

1618
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,040
were like looking at previously and it's

1619
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,640
going to handle like a reset or a

1620
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,720
watchdog timer like the type of things

1621
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,160
and then there is like one that can be

1622
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,520
relocated

1623
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,119
its address is stored in the into b

1624
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,720
register so if you want to find it you

1625
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,440
just look at who's writing into in b

1626
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,960
and this is really interesting because

1627
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,359
it gets triggered for like uart timer

1628
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,319
like can can code so basically like this

1629
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,799
intro vector table has like all the

1630
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,400
interesting entry points for stuff you

1631
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,319
care about so that's great to be able to

1632
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,000
like look at it and and analyze that

1633
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,079
so i don't know if you can see

1634
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,920
it's there's a lot of them it's messy

1635
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,240
it's scary but really like in practice

1636
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,079
like most of them are not implemented in

1637
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,000
the firmware but those that are actually

1638
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,119
implemented are like really the

1639
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,319
interesting one

1640
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,200
um

1641
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,559
to give you an idea of what it looks

1642
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,079
like i picked the really like the most

1643
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,720
simple one which is uh receiving data

1644
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,240
over uart0

1645
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,000
so it fits on the screenshot so that's

1646
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,799
nice

1647
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,960
um and you can see here it's just like

1648
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,000
comparing if like so that that string

1649
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,400
here that variable here is a global

1650
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,280
variable that stores like how many bytes

1651
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,960
are left in the buffer

1652
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,720
the receive buffer and if there is room

1653
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,400
it's going to

1654
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,559
basically read one byte of data and

1655
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,400
store it in the buffer and decrement the

1656
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,960
remaining size and so here like

1657
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,359
what's interesting is this idea that you

1658
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,079
have some global

1659
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,359
global data structures that are

1660
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,599
associated with the the stuff you care

1661
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,760
about in that case for your zero you

1662
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,680
know there is a global global buffer

1663
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,280
that's used and so that's something you

1664
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
could also cross reference to kind of

1665
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,599
see who's handling that

1666
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,240
because uh interrupt code is not like

1667
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,920
and it's like the place we care about

1668
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,319
for like reversing we might be

1669
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,839
interested to see like the higher level

1670
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,440
function like in the operating system

1671
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,359
there's like you know you know how the

1672
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,359
application read data or send data and

1673
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,599
so those global

1674
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,280
buffers are the one that's going to lead

1675
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,799
you to these functions so that's

1676
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,520
interesting to look at

1677
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,520
and the other way to find this

1678
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,440
peripheral is a special function

1679
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,559
registers so there's a bunch of them

1680
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,799
and it's just like some random page of

1681
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,680
memory uh so in that case it's mapped at

1682
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,319
the address zero so from zero to 400 it

1683
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,799
does like

1684
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,480
that's why they're located

1685
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,240
and the idea is that you can just read

1686
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,559
and write to them uh usually like like a

1687
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,000
full value or just like one bit at a

1688
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,039
time

1689
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,119
and what what actually happened when you

1690
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,559
write to them it's like special stuff

1691
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:45,920
right and

1692
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,400
it can trigger an action or change an

1693
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,760
internal setting

1694
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,079
or even read or write data

1695
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,400
to like a peripheral

1696
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,000
so like in that case for instance the

1697
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,640
previous slide the this thing in yellow

1698
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,240
is a special function register

1699
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,880
associated with the uart0 and basically

1700
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,480
when you read from it

1701
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,359
it

1702
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,280
gives you one date one byte of data that

1703
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,160
was sent on the uart

1704
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,960
and the nice stuff is either i diagnose

1705
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,160
the m32c80 special functional registers

1706
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,280
so it all it gives you hints like

1707
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,079
do

1708
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,240
this name and this comment was already

1709
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,240
provided by ida because it knows what it

1710
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,240
is

1711
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,079
and as i said like the one the one

1712
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,640
device i have is like slash 83 instead

1713
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,640
of slash 80. and really what happened is

1714
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,880
some of the peripherals are missing in

1715
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,039
the ida definitions but that's fine

1716
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,119
because we have like all the information

1717
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,480
about that and we can just complete it

1718
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,960
if we need it

1719
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,400
uh and so what you can do with the

1720
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,240
special functional register uh you can

1721
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,640
also cross-reference them and find like

1722
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,880
interesting stuff like in this case uh

1723
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,680
pm1 is a processor mode one which is

1724
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,680
used to like configure like the the mode

1725
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,000
of the processor i guess

1726
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,760
but so you have like the explanation on

1727
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,839
the data sheet of like oh at all each

1728
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,319
bit of that value out of that registers

1729
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,880
like what do they do so if you see some

1730
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,240
random thing in the code that's going to

1731
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,680
clear bits seven of that processor mode

1732
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,520
you'll see oh that's because xyz

1733
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,200
so why do you care about a special

1734
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,119
functional register well you can cross

1735
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,119
refund them and that's going to also

1736
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,039
lead you to all the

1737
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,960
initialization code and like this like

1738
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,640
global data structure that are extremely

1739
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,400
helpful to find the stuff you care about

1740
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,599
and also one of my theory is that

1741
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,280
if you understand this special function

1742
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,200
registers for that device for instance

1743
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,160
and you look at a different embedded uh

1744
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,200
device

1745
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,640
they're also going to have like special

1746
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,200
function registers and so

1747
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,799
not all of them have you know like

1748
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,240
datasheet that you can read that can

1749
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,599
explain you the stuff

1750
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,119
so if you at least have an idea of what

1751
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,880
to expect by understanding one that's

1752
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,480
well documented the day you have

1753
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,079
something that's not documented you

1754
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,599
could kind of like guess and know what

1755
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,640
to expect

1756
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,839
so that's that's my theory about it

1757
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,760
okay so now that we know how to get it

1758
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,400
nida and find stuff how do we find

1759
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,760
interesting like chunk of code

1760
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,000
so originally my point was my work was

1761
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,920
to do like one research on that device

1762
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,520
so i was like oh i want to find the i o

1763
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,079
code so you art and can so maybe to find

1764
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,760
like you know memory corruption the type

1765
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,960
of things

1766
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,039
another interesting one would be like uh

1767
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,200
finding stuff that can modify the flash

1768
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,720
because if you can just strike the

1769
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,480
device into uh

1770
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,319
installing a work firmware update you

1771
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,319
don't need to find like uh you know like

1772
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,280
a memory

1773
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,559
memory variability so that's nice and

1774
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,319
final one it's like oh if you're curious

1775
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,920
you know maybe you can also like try to

1776
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,280
figure out like the physical process of

1777
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,119
the device to understand how it works so

1778
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,200
that's just more like curiosity but

1779
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,039
and so how do we find all of those so

1780
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,799
for you art and can you can find the

1781
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,240
interrupt handlers that leads to

1782
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,160
buffering code and eventually you will

1783
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,079
find message and loss for physical

1784
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,640
process uh you can look at the pwm which

1785
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,799
is uh generating like signals for like

1786
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,720
motors and stuff or like the analog to

1787
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,400
digital converters and that should lead

1788
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,039
you to like business logic that you

1789
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,960
could read if you're interested

1790
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,319
for the flash that's not as obvious

1791
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:14,480
and uh one of the stuff i i found was

1792
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,240
you have this weight control register

1793
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,920
like in the datasheet that was actually

1794
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,599
mentioned like a couple of slides ago on

1795
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,720
the big memory map but what it does is

1796
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,599
uh if you write data to the bus to like

1797
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,799
a slow peripheral you can instruct the

1798
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,359
the cpu the controller to wait a couple

1799
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,480
of cycles

1800
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,240
to give time to the controller to the

1801
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,599
thing to be done

1802
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,680
and that one is kind of specific to the

1803
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,599
m32c i don't know if you'd find that in

1804
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,799
other devices

1805
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,440
but when crosstalk is cross-referencing

1806
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,760
that one what happens is like it only

1807
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,760
leads to a flash modifying code with

1808
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,160
this id that when you write to the flash

1809
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,000
it's going to take a while and so that's

1810
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,559
why it's modifying the wait timer for

1811
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,079
these occasions

1812
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,280
so with that

1813
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,520
we can find that kind of stuff which

1814
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,839
also looks really weird like all that

1815
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,520
part here like i was like why is it

1816
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,760
creating like weird values to like weird

1817
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,839
address like what's going on

1818
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,920
the trick is you can look for like the

1819
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,839
data sheet of the flash

1820
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,640
and the datasheet explains that here

1821
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,520
like

1822
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,920
to program the flash you have to write

1823
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,359
weird values at the right location and

1824
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,799
depending on which

1825
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,640
location or values you're writing it's

1826
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,240
going to be a different command so i

1827
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,000
think in that in that case here i think

1828
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,680
it was like erase like one sector of the

1829
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,559
flash

1830
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,240
so i think that was fun because to me

1831
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,680
like i looked at that and like what is

1832
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
going on and you can just read the data

1833
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,599
sheet of the flash and it tells you

1834
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,480
so important lesson here

1835
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,359
so

1836
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,520
for my project with that i was able to

1837
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,880
find the right anyways function of the

1838
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,960
flash so looking for like firmware

1839
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,000
upgrade that's the place you want to

1840
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,880
look at

1841
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,400
turns out unfortunately the main

1842
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,960
application cannot rewrite itself so it

1843
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,039
can only modify like calibration and

1844
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,720
that kind of stuff so i was kind of

1845
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,039
bummed but there is a second set of

1846
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,359
riders functions like why is that and

1847
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,559
that's coming from that bootloader

1848
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,000
recovery card that was pointing at

1849
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,240
previously and so this one can actually

1850
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,640
rewrite the whole flash um

1851
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,400
spoiler i did not follow that part

1852
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,960
because i found like an easier one but

1853
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,960
that was pretty interesting and

1854
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,039
pretty sure you know we could refresh

1855
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,238
the

1856
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,560
the device this way

1857
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,198
just to give an another example of the

1858
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,719
whole process

1859
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,439
to find a can processing code

1860
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,839
um you can start by looking at the

1861
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,520
interrupt handler

1862
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,359
inside the interrupt and law you can

1863
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,839
identify some global data structure in

1864
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,759
this case here you have like a wing

1865
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,679
buffer that's going to store like the

1866
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,839
message that are coming over the canvas

1867
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,238
and if you cross-reference that

1868
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,000
you can find like a bunch of functions

1869
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,759
but eventually you can leave that's like

1870
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,520
a loop like that which is

1871
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,520
kind of like the processing code which

1872
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,279
get one message out of the the ring

1873
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,479
buffer and then call the processing uh

1874
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,399
handle handle the message

1875
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,799
and if you try to see like what the

1876
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,880
the handling does it's getting

1877
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,640
complicated like this is like a lot of

1878
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,198
like messing with bites and it's it's

1879
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,479
getting messy

1880
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,279
and if you look at you know like where

1881
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,960
like it goes further and just like get

1882
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,880
worse and worse so i was i was like oh

1883
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,920
good i don't want to do that

1884
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,520
so in the end the result was like i did

1885
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,080
not find any uh memory corruption in the

1886
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,679
processing code he was doing like good

1887
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,520
like safety checks of the the bounds and

1888
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,600
stuff so it's a medical device so i

1889
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,040
think they have like kind of like a

1890
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,120
reliability issues more than security

1891
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,279
but in this you know it's built to be

1892
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,439
like safe to some extent

1893
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,600
but i figured like a bunch of comments

1894
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,120
uh and those comments were like exposed

1895
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,479
you know to the outside world so that's

1896
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,198
interesting and also i'm mostly certain

1897
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,799
i found like one command that actually

1898
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,120
reboots you in bootloader mode so that's

1899
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,479
definitely like a path that could have

1900
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,238
been followed

1901
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,479
and so basically like the next step at

1902
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,000
that point would be

1903
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,920
well you could emulate the whole code

1904
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,719
and fuzz it to try to find like memory

1905
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,320
memory vulnerability that you know just

1906
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,000
like static analysis couldn't highlight

1907
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,159
explore that flashing stuff that i did

1908
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,480
not do but

1909
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,159
interestingly like you could also look

1910
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:08,960
for

1911
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,719
data or logic bugs

1912
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,120
that you can reach via the can

1913
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,679
processing code

1914
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,520
which i'm going to talk about in a sec

1915
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,679
uh so yeah what we learned

1916
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,640
intertenders and sfrs are great you lead

1917
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,760
you to like

1918
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,320
can you heart timers etc and if you like

1919
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,679
know what to expect and familiar with

1920
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,520
this concept that will make your life

1921
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,360
easier like when you reverse stuff in

1922
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,759
the future

1923
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,280
so okay

1924
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,120
uh now that we have an idea of like how

1925
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,880
the process works what can you do for

1926
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,239
like a high level like what's

1927
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,600
interesting

1928
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,640
um

1929
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,760
one of the uh i guess cheat codes was

1930
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,239
this uh internal database

1931
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,159
so it's used uh

1932
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,400
internally to kind of retrieve like

1933
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,320
settings for the device and also like

1934
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,000
trigger actions

1935
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,840
but it's also exposed over the uart and

1936
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,679
the canvas so that

1937
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:02,080
it can be returned to from the outside

1938
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,440
world

1939
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,239
and

1940
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,840
i didn't detail that before but

1941
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,520
basically the pump can talk with a

1942
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,320
communication module

1943
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,120
that is linux based and so we can easily

1944
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,239
easily

1945
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,560
uh reverse its binaries

1946
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,840
and one of them is able to produce like

1947
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,239
kind of like a backup of this database

1948
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,600
and it has like when you look at the

1949
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,320
backup it has like human readable like

1950
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,280
keys

1951
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,520
so the idea here is like you can reverse

1952
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,040
that recover like the name of all the

1953
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,040
keys and the mapping with like the

1954
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,480
actual like value

1955
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,000
for the device

1956
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,960
and then you can rename that inside of

1957
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,120
the firmware so that when you read like

1958
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,880
in you know instead of

1959
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,280
write database and 315 you'll be like oh

1960
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
it's changing settings like i don't know

1961
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,760
like

1962
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,840
the uh

1963
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,080
the name of the patient for instance

1964
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,320
so that makes like makes life extremely

1965
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,520
easier

1966
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,560
uh

1967
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,440
so yeah

1968
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,600
so that's that's the cool uh stuff so to

1969
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,920
give you an idea that's um what it looks

1970
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,000
like um

1971
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,040
in uh in either so i create like an enum

1972
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,640
with like all the values

1973
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,560
and on the right side this is like the

1974
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,760
the entries of the the data the database

1975
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,440
entries

1976
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,719
so you can see there's much more

1977
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,480
parameters that we can figure out it's

1978
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,480
like limits and stuff but

1979
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,239
not extremely important for for what we

1980
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,560
cared about what was more interesting is

1981
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,800
like you know random piece of code we

1982
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,719
can see like you know some database

1983
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,440
function not sure what but it's going to

1984
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,360
call you know a

1985
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,880
rate rate by bazel whatever that is

1986
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,719
which

1987
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,560
change the rate of supplying the

1988
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,239
chemicals or something

1989
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,480
but it makes like reading disassembly

1990
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,920
much easier because all of that is done

1991
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,120
automatically once you have

1992
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,560
create the synonym so that's really nice

1993
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,560
um

1994
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,080
so

1995
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,760
actually that's not the the way i want

1996
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,199
for it but

1997
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,280
this is like one of the binary for the

1998
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,679
on the communication module so the

1999
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,840
communication module i was running like

2000
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,239
linux as i said and it's like an

2001
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,679
arm binary it's nice easy you can

2002
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,280
decompile it in either

2003
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,440
and it's building like this table of

2004
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,480
key name and key value here and so

2005
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
technically you could you know

2006
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,040
use that to recover the stuff uh that

2007
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,199
being said like every time i scroll

2008
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,480
through the stuff because there's like

2009
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,800
arsenal like 40 000 lines of coding that

2010
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,760
functions

2011
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,920
ida would spend like 20 minutes like

2012
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,480
decompiling and hanging so i was pretty

2013
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,880
sad about it that was tedious

2014
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,840
um

2015
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,000
and so yes but

2016
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,520
in the end like what really happened was

2017
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,880
like i found like a different binary

2018
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,199
that are just all the keys in order and

2019
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,400
i extracted that

2020
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,400
but i wanted to share like a way of

2021
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,599
doing it like self-contained

2022
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,239
uh another like fun stuff on that device

2023
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,400
was called the drug library

2024
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,800
which was uh something i was like oh

2025
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,640
that's interesting because it's

2026
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,640
business logic of the device

2027
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,320
it's complete as far as i can tell it's

2028
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,400
completely undocumented

2029
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,040
and it's used uh for instance to specify

2030
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,840
like

2031
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,480
in in a specific hospital which drugs

2032
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,159
are available what are like the default

2033
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,560
concentration and also it implements

2034
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,640
like soft and hard limits

2035
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,360
we decided that if a nurse by accident

2036
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,920
you know dialed the wrong number and the

2037
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,199
wrong unit

2038
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,520
it would detect that if the value is not

2039
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,080
within like okay range and would trigger

2040
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,280
like an alert

2041
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,800
so that there was a god that could be

2042
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,320
interesting enough for one research from

2043
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,800
like you know mess with the device

2044
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,000
uh the only info i had was this great

2045
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,560
screenshot that's a little skewed

2046
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,239
uh but that's from the manufacturer like

2047
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,679
i couldn't get the actual software that

2048
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,159
generates new drug libraries and so that

2049
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,760
was just like my hints of like what

2050
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,920
might be in it

2051
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,600
and yeah i had also like from the flash

2052
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,880
dump i had

2053
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,719
the one drug library that was installed

2054
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,880
on the device i had

2055
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,600
so how how do you go about that uh

2056
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,760
i really wanted to share like that tool

2057
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,239
it's called like kaitai so it's just a

2058
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,000
generic

2059
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,679
generic software that lets you create a

2060
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,239
definition of that data structures like

2061
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,239
over here

2062
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,920
and it's just like you know a web app

2063
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,239
that you can you can use

2064
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,760
and you know you provided like whatever

2065
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,040
blob of data you want you want to

2066
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,239
analyze and from there like you can both

2067
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,520
at the same time like edit the

2068
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,719
definition

2069
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,360
and visualize in real time like the

2070
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,120
result of the processing of the code so

2071
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
that's like one of the examples here so

2072
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,480
that's really useful from like a

2073
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,560
reversing standpoint because if you try

2074
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,719
to understand the um

2075
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,159
the meaning of the data structure the

2076
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,920
data you're looking at

2077
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,159
and how it's structured you can

2078
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,080
make experimentations like oh from

2079
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,600
reading the code that's

2080
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,440
half understand i think

2081
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,480
this

2082
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,000
table is doing this and that and so you

2083
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,080
can try and verify if it works and if it

2084
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,360
works you don't have to reverse further

2085
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,880
and if it doesn't you can you know work

2086
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,920
harder

2087
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,440
but and

2088
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,199
so yeah so that's the point that kyta is

2089
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,960
really a good tool and you know it can

2090
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,920
be used for like things that have

2091
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,440
nothing to do with embedded systems it's

2092
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,239
just

2093
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,560
really useful uh piece of software

2094
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,920
and just to give you an idea of what it

2095
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,400
looked like in um

2096
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,560
in practice so that was a piece of code

2097
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,480
that was i think

2098
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,960
getting the name of like a word like in

2099
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,440
the in the drug library and by slowly

2100
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,199
like understanding that part you can

2101
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,640
kind of like start like defining the

2102
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,560
stuff in kaitai and then you can explore

2103
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
like the data progressively

2104
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,360
uh the cool end result of that research

2105
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,600
was a bit of a dead end but still pretty

2106
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,880
fun

2107
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,640
so we were able to

2108
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,560
put our name like in the drug library

2109
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,800
and uh so atr is like the name of my

2110
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,840
team

2111
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,080
and so basically like by reversing the

2112
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,840
format of the data structure and all the

2113
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,800
crcs and etc like we were able to forge

2114
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,040
like a new drug library like from the

2115
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,000
original we had and upload it to the

2116
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,040
device and have it accepted so from a

2117
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,719
proof of concept that okay we put our

2118
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,719
name in it but really like from a

2119
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,480
vulnerability research you can be like

2120
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,880
well an attacker can you know tamper

2121
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,480
with the drug library which providing

2122
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,120
like safety limits on the device so that

2123
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,159
i think that's the kind of stuff that

2124
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,440
gets like you know like manufacture like

2125
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,120
scales like oh you can do that that's

2126
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,440
not good so we're like that was pretty

2127
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,678
cool

2128
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,000
but wait there is more

2129
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,760
like another stuff that we had is called

2130
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,520
like disposable data

2131
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,000
so that's basically like calibration

2132
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,679
that is

2133
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,600
used by the pump so it's like more

2134
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,280
business logic but this one is kind of

2135
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,800
like more straightforward it's just like

2136
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,480
basically it's just keys in the database

2137
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,800
i was talking about so much easier to

2138
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,320
understand i mean some of the data are

2139
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,239
also like crc so there is some like

2140
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,159
reversing to be done we were like oh

2141
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,800
that's an interesting target also for uh

2142
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,480
van research because you know if you

2143
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,600
want to if you can mess with the

2144
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
calibration of the device like remotely

2145
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,480
that's

2146
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,320
scary you know

2147
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,960
so just to give you an idea um

2148
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,440
on the left side that is uh part of the

2149
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,840
calibration like the disposable data so

2150
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,400
all of those are like key names uh in

2151
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,159
the database i was talking about and

2152
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,480
those are exposed on the canvas

2153
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,360
and

2154
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,120
through the research project we had we

2155
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,800
were like able to uh

2156
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
compromise the communication module from

2157
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,719
the network and send like arbitrary

2158
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,199
messages and so the idea is like we can

2159
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,800
tamper with all of that

2160
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,199
and one that like picked my curiosity

2161
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,280
was called like two bed volume

2162
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,800
which i think is the diff but the

2163
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,320
definition of it would be like kind of

2164
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,480
like the crosstalk like the size of the

2165
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,400
cross section of the tube inside the

2166
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,040
pump because you can kind of change you

2167
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,880
can have different tube size

2168
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,360
and that's important because you know we

2169
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,239
can do more you know reverse engineering

2170
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,159
and find why it's being used but

2171
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,719
basically it's used by the device to do

2172
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,920
uh calculations of you know how fast it

2173
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,679
needs to pump in order to deliver like

2174
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,000
the right amount of drug and so if it

2175
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,679
has the wrong value it's going to pump

2176
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,000
at the wrong rate and push too much drug

2177
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,360
or not enough

2178
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,199
and so we have four for curiosity

2179
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,800
because you know i just tried and it

2180
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,480
worked but you can see like some of the

2181
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,239
master being done here and you can see

2182
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,360
that

2183
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,960
directly changing the cubed volume is

2184
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,400
going to

2185
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,719
directly affect the

2186
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,360
the mass like linearly

2187
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,280
so now i have a

2188
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,159
demo video of where it's going to work

2189
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,080
this is the whole exploitation process

2190
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,400
of the pump uh there's more steps i

2191
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,159
didn't cover like in this presentation

2192
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,239
about compromising the the communication

2193
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,239
module but basically all of this can be

2194
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,719
done from the network

2195
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:35,040
let's see if it works

2196
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,400
yes so that's my colleague dog doing the

2197
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,360
um

2198
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,040
doing the

2199
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,280
the run so the idea is first we just run

2200
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,120
the pump like normally

2201
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,480
and we're going to pretend that we're

2202
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,880
going to inject i think like one liter

2203
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,840
of drugs in 10 hours so like we can see

2204
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,000
here putting the tubes

2205
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,560
but it's just it's just water you know

2206
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,120
and uh

2207
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,400
and so like the idea is like the first

2208
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,080
time we just established like how the

2209
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,920
process work and what's a normal

2210
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,440
operation of the device

2211
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,760
so it's you know pushing drug slowly

2212
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,440
and in a second we're going to fast

2213
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,760
forward a couple of minute letters

2214
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,280
so we can see

2215
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,280
it says you know five milliliters of

2216
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,960
drug has been dispensed

2217
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,040
and you can see on the uh on the thing

2218
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,800
here that five milliliters were like

2219
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,960
actually dispensed so that's good that's

2220
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,280
what you would expect

2221
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,380
but now we can run

2222
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,840
[Music]

2223
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,520
we can run our exploits so the first

2224
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,040
part of the exploit is compromising the

2225
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,560
communication module

2226
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,320
from the network so basically we get

2227
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,080
root on it

2228
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,440
which is like ongoing here

2229
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,719
and then

2230
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,560
because we're kind of lazy we just took

2231
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,239
over like one of the existing binary on

2232
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,239
the device to make it sound like can

2233
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,320
messages for us instead of writing our

2234
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,239
own code doing that and we're kind of

2235
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,639
doing it like through gdb because we're

2236
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,360
like really lazy

2237
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,040
and so we can see here like the tube add

2238
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,960
volume value uh

2239
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,719
in the database was like

2240
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,600
one five c and so now we're rewriting uh

2241
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,800
the whole database with new values

2242
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,840
and uh

2243
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,920
and we also trigger something called

2244
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,920
like service mods uh for being able to

2245
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,520
modify these critical values of the of

2246
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,440
the device supposedly we're not supposed

2247
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,199
to do that over the network but

2248
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,280
according to the manufacturer so that's

2249
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,120
impossible

2250
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,840
uh and so rewrite the whole stuff

2251
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,920
and then we reboot the pump for like the

2252
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,520
change to take effect

2253
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,760
the fun stuff here it's uh it's going to

2254
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,920
start to blink angry like it's blinking

2255
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,080
red it's like oh something was modified

2256
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,639
on the device be careful but turns out

2257
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,120
like if you turn it off and on again it

2258
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,560
just cleared the alert

2259
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,840
so everything is fine now

2260
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,239
so that's good

2261
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,400
and now we can double check so we have

2262
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,639
divided the value by two so two bet

2263
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,239
volume is now like half of what it used

2264
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,679
to be

2265
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,159
and we're going to rerun the attack same

2266
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,639
like 50 milliliter of water

2267
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:05,920
and we're going to enter the same

2268
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,679
settings so like

2269
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,440
one liter of drugs to be infused over

2270
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,960
like 10 hours

2271
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,080
you know like the pump is like

2272
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,960
everything is fine yeah right

2273
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,400
so we do the stuff

2274
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,679
same tube same size

2275
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,960
so that's nice

2276
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,840
and so now we rerun the the infusion

2277
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,000
and if we pay attention it's kind of

2278
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,840
i mean maybe because it it's going

2279
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,520
faster you know but here what happened

2280
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,120
at the end we can see like 10

2281
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,880
milliliters of water has been like

2282
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,040
dispensed but the pump believes it's

2283
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,960
like only five

2284
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,920
so that's

2285
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,239
that's really scary

2286
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,360
thank you

2287
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,280
so uh

2288
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,920
[Applause]

2289
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,880
so

2290
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,639
with that you know and in that situation

2291
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,239
we only divided the number by two so we

2292
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,080
could you know divide by four by eight

2293
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,000
or whatever and that would like each

2294
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,639
time like increase the speed of uh the

2295
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,800
drug being pushed and we talk with like

2296
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,560
medical professionals and they're like

2297
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,320
yeah that would someone up like you

2298
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,040
know

2299
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,159
because

2300
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,600
it makes sense right

2301
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,360
so um

2302
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,880
so yeah so that's the that's why we

2303
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,719
could do it just like through like

2304
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,960
no memory corruption just like

2305
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,440
using the the features of the devices

2306
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,920
as intended or not i don't know

2307
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,320
but uh useful information like the

2308
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
database keynames for instance

2309
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,560
but also you know understanding uh the

2310
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,000
internal representation of the data on

2311
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,159
the device is crucial for you know

2312
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,159
having a clue of what's going on

2313
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,560
uh kaitai uh great software for

2314
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,719
reversing stuff

2315
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,440
and uh logic volts can be as deadly as

2316
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,360
you know memory options you know

2317
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,040
no need to go around the crazy like

2318
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,560
memory corruption if you can just you

2319
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,520
know change like important settings

2320
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,760
so just as a summary i made like a nice

2321
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,719
diagram

2322
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:57,600
and

2323
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,600
yeah you can see so

2324
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,440
the process

2325
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,040
you get to get started you know like you

2326
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,800
recover the documentation you you read

2327
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,000
the docs

2328
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
you uh them the firmware you import this

2329
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,440
in either

2330
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,639
pretty simple

2331
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:11,920
and then you try to figure out the layer

2332
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,840
of the land so you identify the

2333
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,120
peripherals and thanks to the

2334
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,880
documentation the special function

2335
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,120
registers the interrupt sender and that

2336
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,120
leads to stuff like uart con flash etc

2337
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,480
meanwhile you can also start like

2338
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,719
 around in either and you can

2339
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,159
find like like the database drug

2340
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,480
libraries crc bootloader so you find

2341
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,320
like all the interesting stuff

2342
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,639
and then that can inform you you know

2343
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,920
what to pawn

2344
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,719
so

2345
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,040
in my case like oh vulnerability in the

2346
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,679
io code didn't pan out because i didn't

2347
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,440
find anything obvious

2348
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,000
uploading a firmware update didn't quite

2349
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,520
work either because the main application

2350
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,840
couldn't refresh itself but as i said

2351
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,760
there's probably like other ways

2352
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,480
and just looking at the critical data so

2353
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,639
in this case disposable data

2354
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,120
exposed on the canvas yeah that was that

2355
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,600
was the winning attack like easy peasy

2356
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,440
and you know

2357
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,840
we hugged the planet

2358
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
so the whole diagram

2359
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,239
and so yeah as a conclusion i would say

2360
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,239
don't be scared of you know unfamiliar

2361
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,440
architecture

2362
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,199
you know i when i started that project i

2363
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,040
had no clue what m32c was and

2364
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,040
that didn't stop me from like hacking

2365
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,080


2366
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,760
and yeah this reverse engineering effort

2367
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,679
was uh really critical for like the

2368
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,679
bigger project of pointing the pump

2369
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,440
and as i said there is a whole blog post

2370
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,120
about the whole details so if you could

2371
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,040
use you can read it

2372
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,600
and i guess that's all

2373
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,199
if you have questions i think i have

2374
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,880
like 15 minutes left

2375
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,480
and otherwise you can find me at happy

2376
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,679
hour or

2377
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,040
find me on twitter

2378
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,740
thank you

2379
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:54,750
[Applause]

2380
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,920
any question yeah

2381
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,840
so

2382
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,800
we have about 15 minutes before the next

2383
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,280
talk uh they've got

2384
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,520
physical gear that they're trying to set

2385
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,360
up so uh

2386
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,040
feel free to have a drink and be sure to

2387
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,880
tip your bartender

2388
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,159
thank you

2389
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,159
fantastic

2390
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,400
so the i had a question and the question

2391
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,080
was if the instructions are three bits

2392
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,960
three bytes uh why am i adding six in

2393
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,920
the switch code uh which i have actually

2394
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,440
no id so i need to find the code

2395
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,080
uh where is the switch code

2396
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,679
reverse

2397
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,120
here

2398
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,520
so here i'm adding six and that's

2399
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,760
because uh there was not like

2400
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,920
instructions that was like passing the

2401
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,280
the data structure

2402
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,239
so

2403
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:59,760
uh

2404
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,560
so

2405
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,639
the offset is four bytes

2406
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,320
and

2407
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,800
and uh the value is two i think

2408
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,730
so i think that's right

2409
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:10,820
[Music]

2410

01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,639
difficulties we are ready to go with our

2471
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,080
next talk

2472
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:55,360
uh so with me here is edward

2473

researcher i assume

2476
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,639
a software engineer that's

2477
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,800
actually better sometimes

2478
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,639

a proud asian-american

2480
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,400
security researcher

2481
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,360
uh

2482
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,639

thank you everyone for coming out

2492
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,440
um

2493
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,920
we have some dollars here

2494
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,920
if you forgot to tip your bartender just

2495
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,840
come up and get them afterwards

2496
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,159
we can hook you up with that

2497
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:49,360
and

2498
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,400
we're just going to jump into it

2499
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,199

2509
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:37,920
all right well thanks for coming the

2510
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:38,800
talk

2511
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,760
see you guys next year

2512
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,880
where's the mouse up so that was pretty

2513
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,440
cool but what's even cooler

2514
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,480
is you can do all that in python

2515
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,560
you guys love python right yeah so hello

2516
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,840
world

2517
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,360
you know a couple lines of code

2518
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,520
summer con

2519
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,440
we pre-recorded all the demos so i think

2520
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,360
the demo gods were angry so they made

2521
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,119
our computer not work yeah

2522
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:06,800
but anyway

2523
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,400
so what we're going to talk about today

2524
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,440
is in a word of rack uh or the ofrac

2525
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,400
that was the ofrac that is and some of

2526
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,800
that stuff that's yet to come

2527
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,239
so our story starts 10 years ago

2528
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,600
and

2529
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,679
our protagonist

2530
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,760
is not yet dr ang shui

2531
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,199
and he gave a talk

2532
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,800
at def con

2533
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,000
here are some of the slides kind of

2534
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,600
interesting like

2535
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,760
only aida up there

2536
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,639
bin walk and matlab for some reason

2537
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,199
grad students go figure i don't know

2538
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,639
okay

2539
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:43,679
and

2540
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:44,880
the reason

2541
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,000
i not yet dr ang shui stay up on home on

2542
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,159
friday nights is because i'm staring at

2543
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:51,840
binary blobs

2544
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,199
and i really want to be doing payload

2545
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,880
development

2546
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,560
but i'm staring and staring at binary

2547
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,000
blobs and i thought this there has to be

2548
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,239
a better way

2549
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:03,360
and there is with frack

2550
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,040
and so frack

2551
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,960
the talk went out

2552
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,639
but then like where was frack what

2553
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,800
happened to it part of that talk was

2554
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,960
frack will be available for download

2555
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,840
yeah

2556
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,239
and a couple years later

2557
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:17,360
someone

2558
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,360
asked where can i download the latest

2559
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,520
version of frack

2560
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,040
and there's a very helpful answer that

2561
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,639
someone posted

2562
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:26,800
let me just bring this up

2563
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,560
basically saying that you know it

2564
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,760
appears it was never released but you

2565
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,760
can try to contact the author

2566
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,760
through a rebellionsecure.com so thank

2567
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,159
you for that helpful comment so i guess

2568
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:39,759
the question is where can i get frac

2569
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,960
uh wait is that my

2570
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,119
is that my cue or yeah all right

2571
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,400
all right so

2572
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,280
man

2573
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,679
so many sad stories um

2574
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,679
10 years ago right i came up with this

2575
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:52,960
idea because

2576
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,119
it was fairly obvious to me at the time

2577
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,600
and pretty obvious now that all of these

2578
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,600
stupid devices run in this firmware

2579
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,520
that's packed in binaries that's opaque

2580
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,719
and difficult and you have to write

2581
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,800
throwaway code just to get through the

2582
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,239
little things on the outside so that you

2583
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,400
can start reasoning about the security

2584
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,119
things on the inside and on top of that

2585
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,440
it was almost impossible to communicate

2586
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,040
what you found with other people without

2587
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,600
breaking like all sorts of whatever laws

2588
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,600
right of like copyright and like

2589
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,440
intellectual property and blah blah blah

2590
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,199
so i said you know wouldn't it be nice

2591
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,679
if we just created a thing that was the

2592
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:27,840
general firmware like software structure

2593
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,520
that allowed people to

2594
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,360
codify the way that these binaries are

2595
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,600
unpacked repacked and analyzed and

2596
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,080
modified so we can get through the like

2597
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,239
writing the like throwaway code

2598
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,239
so that way we can start concentrating

2599
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:41,040
on

2600
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,360
uh thinking about the security parts

2601
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,800
reasoning about the firmware that

2602
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,320
actually runs on the processors of all

2603
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,159
these things so i as a very idealistic

2604
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,760
grad student went on stage and said like

2605
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,679
hey i came up with this idea and it was

2606
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:55,360
i think pretty cool so like i'm gonna

2607
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,119
like make it open source so everyone can

2608
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:58,480
download it so we can start wasting time

2609
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:59,920
and like push security forward for

2610
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,119
better things and then within 12 hours

2611
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,800
i got three different emails from three

2612
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,159
different lawyers

2613
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,560
lawyer number one was a columbia lawyer

2614
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,960
right lord number two was company lawyer

2615
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,119
for red balloon and lawyer number three

2616
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:16,320
was a professor at columbia who's also a

2617
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,400
lawyer so lawyer number one and two said

2618
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,560
are you out of your goddamn mind if you

2619
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,239
enjoy writing a company that doesn't get

2620
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:24,239
sued into the ground don't do this

2621
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,960
otherwise feel free go for it and lawyer

2622
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,119
number three was even mowglin who was

2623
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,960
like can i have a copy of this

2624
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,560
immediately so i can go sue samsung so

2625
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,800
we never made it

2626
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,400
open source because we were a small

2627
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,480
company then and it was fraught with uh

2628
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,199
just death traps uh but over the last 10

2629
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,320
years we've been refining this

2630
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,080
capability in-house and this is like

2631
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,560
kind of the way the thing that allowed

2632
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,560
us to do all the really fancy firmer

2633
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,920
stuff that we do

2634
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,840
and then lo and behold you know sergey

2635
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,400
comes along a few years ago

2636
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,880
and he said hey you know what i think i

2637
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,719
came up with a way for you to release

2638
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,719
the framework for olfrac in a way that

2639
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:05,440
no one gets sued with let's let's say

2640
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,440
backing of darpa as a fundamental

2641
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,360
research tool that will actually push

2642
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,520
embedded security forward and uh here we

2643
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,239
go

2644
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:14,480
so o is for

2645
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,119
uh open open yeah

2646
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,199
yeah we put the o on there

2647
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:20,560
it would be kind of ironic if we don't

2648
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,239
release it after this talk but you know

2649
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,320
we're we're taking baby steps there

2650
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,440
anyway so far everything's on track

2651
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,000
um so now the cast of characters is much

2652
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,679
expanded uh there's myself uh there's

2653
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:35,920
wyatt who's totally not up on stage

2654
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:39,270
right now i've got jacob timothy

2655
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:40,560
[Music]

2656
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,119
tosos chris so many people have worked

2657
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,440
on ofrac now at this point uh that we

2658
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,040
can't really list all of them so just

2659
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,199
take this representative sample of our

2660
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,440
various mascots and to kind of like put

2661
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,960
that in perspective we decided we're not

2662
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,560
gonna have one mascot we're gonna have a

2663
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,080
bunch of animals

2664
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,840
so we have a cat

2665
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,400
a snake a turtle a mushroom and

2666
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,159
caterpillar right now we're taking

2667
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,520
requests

2668
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,880
whose

2669
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,480
most favorite mascot is the cat raise

2670
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,159
the hands

2671
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,560
yeah what about the turtle

2672
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,560
i see you turtle edward's a turtle

2673
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,760
person what about the snake

2674
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,760
this snake is not popular i guess we

2675
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,639
have to cut it yeah how about the

2676
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:21,440
mushroom

2677
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,560
yeah is it is it an animal but do i care

2678
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,000
because people really based on it it's

2679
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,440
an animal okay all right the last one

2680
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,119
the the centipede or is it millipede i

2681
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:32,719
thought it was a caterpillar caterpillar

2682
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,440
some sort of incest yeah

2683
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,440
well it got no chairs in any case so

2684
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,880
food for thought which one of these

2685
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:39,920
animals

2686
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,719
most represents dr aung shui

2687
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,080
think about it come get me later if you

2688
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,520
have any ideas yeah there's a correct

2689
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,440
answer

2690
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,119
so okay we've been talking about oh

2691
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,440
frack what is it um ang filled us in a

2692
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,280
little bit but it stands for open

2693
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,280
firmware reverse analysis console it's a

2694
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,199
software tool that combines the ability

2695
01:51:57,199 --> 01:52:00,159
to unpack analyze modify and repack

2696
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,159
binaries

2697
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,560
so the open uh means that it's designed

2698
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,599
to be extended with additional

2699
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,440
components capabilities it's also going

2700
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,880
to be open source of course yeah it

2701
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,599
means we have to release it yeah okay

2702
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:15,199
um it's firmware uh oriented so it has

2703
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,119
first class support for firmware packed

2704
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,920
file systems monolithic firmware

2705
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,239
it reverse it means both like for

2706
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:23,920
reverse engineering and reversible

2707
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,320
binary changes so that's what unpack

2708
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,960
modify and then repack is

2709
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,679
the analysis is that it brings together

2710
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,000
analysis from a wide range of tools so

2711
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,560
from libmagic to lvm uh

2712
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,639
these really mature tools like guidra

2713
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:41,040
binary ninja

2714
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,599
and the console part reflects that it is

2715
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:46,320
at its core there's a python api so

2716
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,639
everything is available in literate

2717
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,880
readable reproducible scripts

2718
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,719
and we've also created a graphical user

2719
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,960
interface for the interactive

2720
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,480
exploration and visualization of

2721
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:00,480
binaries one could call it the oh fakui

2722
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,718
yes

2723
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,440
so so why ong touched on why a bit but

2724
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,280
in a sentence when it comes to embedded

2725
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,199
devices firmware you don't know what's

2726
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:14,159
there you don't know what isn't there

2727
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,080
and you don't know how to change it and

2728
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,199
you want to change it yeah so i mean

2729
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,280
sure all this obscurity it's totally for

2730
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,280
your own good this means the bad guys

2731
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,360
totally can't do anything to it either

2732
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,639
right

2733
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,719
that's not reality um and as ang

2734
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:29,840
mentioned you know we're not the only

2735
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,760
ones aware of this a part of ofrac's

2736
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,360
development has been funded through

2737
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,000
darpa the assured micro patching program

2738
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,639
um and i won't read this whole paragraph

2739
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,480
out loud but it's basically we're saying

2740
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,440
the same things that we've been saying

2741
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,520
so and it's important for us

2742
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,360
specifically at red balloon because our

2743
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,119
typical workflow

2744
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:51,360
looks like this we we take some device

2745
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,080
firmware we have to unpack it analyze it

2746
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,599
we've got to modify it with some new

2747
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,400
features and then repack it so we need a

2748
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,239
tool that is capable of doing all of

2749
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,920
those steps

2750
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,080
and also allows us to transfer and build

2751
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,599
on knowledge both externally and

2752
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:07,920
internally and is something that we can

2753
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,800
actually

2754
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,400
use commercially and we can test

2755
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,239
reproduce and scale up these builds

2756
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:15,040
so

2757
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,280
how does zofrak help us do that it says

2758
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,360
oh how

2759
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,159
well

2760
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,400
i'm improvising all right so

2761
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,639
so ofrac uh generally models firmware in

2762
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:25,920
a way that reflects how we reverse

2763
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,880
engineer and modify it uh so we

2764
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,840
represent everything as uh everything in

2765
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,080
the firmware as resources and we have

2766
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,599
components which operate on those

2767
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,080
resources so this is a bit of a

2768
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,679
compressed version of the workflow that

2769
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,199
i just showed only showing like kind of

2770
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:44,000
unpack modify repack

2771
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,440
but uh basically everything in ofrac

2772
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,880
every piece of the firmware is

2773
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,520
represented as a resource and resources

2774
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,320
are arranged in trees so this represents

2775
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,560
everything from like guitar archive some

2776
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,639
kind of packed file system

2777
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:00,960
down to like the the structures within

2778
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,639
an l file

2779
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,880
and then the the actual code within that

2780
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,560
so the basic blocks the instructions

2781
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,719
within those uh how the basic blocks are

2782
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,560
arranged into functions

2783
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,599
um and then these resources have uh

2784
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:15,840
various pieces of information embedded

2785
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,320
in them so tags describing what it is on

2786
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,199
this slide that's like the elf tag there

2787
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:22,800
elf header of program header those are

2788
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,760
tags

2789
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,920
as well as various attributes with more

2790
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,719
detailed structured analysis results

2791
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:32,560
and then binary data of course

2792
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,320
the so the resource is kind of a like

2793
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,000
abstract general representation of an

2794
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,920
object most of the time practically you

2795
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,960
want to

2796
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,400
uh have some particular information and

2797
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,679
functionality

2798
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,280
specific to the type of resource

2799
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,920
available um conveniently so that we

2800
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:49,440
have this resource view which makes that

2801
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,320
available uh this is an example of the

2802
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,080
elf sec of the elf and that's really

2803
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,840
cool because you know

2804
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,080
we've provided basic resource views like

2805
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,960
elves basic blocks instructions but if

2806
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,719
you get some weird you know firmware

2807
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:04,320
format you can create a view for it to

2808
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,040
do

2809
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,040
the custom thing that you need and then

2810
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,639
you can even use that beautiful api to

2811
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,880
do it

2812
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,040
yup and the other uh important piece of

2813
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,360
offec are components um so these are

2814
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,719
maybe the most important part of both

2815
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:17,679
rack

2816
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:18,960
because the components are how we

2817
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,280
encapsulate procedures and that's uh

2818
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,760
that can be targeted on resources that's

2819
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,679
how we bring in external tools like

2820
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:26,880
gidra

2821
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,480
and there's five main types of

2822
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,320
components so the first one's an

2823
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,520
identifier

2824
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
so identifier answers the question what

2825
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,199
is this resource

2826
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:38,000
okay so this is an example of the

2827
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,599
identifier running and then it tags the

2828
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:41,280
resource so that you know oh that's nice

2829
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,400
it's a program

2830
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,840
and it's an elf

2831
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,480
and identifier is a like extensible

2832
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:48,880
class so on the screen here is an

2833
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,840
example of an apk identifier

2834
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,880
so how do you know that a file is an apk

2835
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,800
well you can write the code that

2836
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,719
determines that and so here oh it's kind

2837
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:00,400
of cut off on the screen but basically

2838
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,400
you can unzip the file and check if

2839
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,719
there's an apk manifest inside of it and

2840
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,719
if there is we tag it as an apk and

2841
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:07,920
that's kind of nice because then the

2842
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,440
next component could come along and

2843
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,040
modify it

2844
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,800
yeah so the next type of component is

2845
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,800
unpackers it's kind of like zooming in

2846
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,920
on a resource by breaking it up into the

2847
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,599
the finer structures that make up this

2848
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,760
resource then you can focus in on those

2849
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,840
on those

2850
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,840
structures so so

2851
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,239
let's just look at an example of that

2852
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,480
so this is an elf resource when we

2853
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,639
unpack it we identify all of the various

2854
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,000
structures within those the different

2855
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,040
tables headers the different sections

2856
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,280
and so one of the first children of this

2857
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:43,360
is the uh general elf header

2858
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,119
and this is an example of the squash

2859
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,280
fest on packer you'll notice that our

2860
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:48,960
implementation of a squash of festive

2861
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,480
packer is basically just calling this

2862
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:53,040
unsquashfest tool this is a common

2863
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,520
pattern in oafrac we use an external

2864
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,679
tool because we don't want to have to

2865
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:00,159
reinvent the wheel uh

2866
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:02,000
so and then we can just slurp up that

2867
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,239
file system that that the on squashfs

2868
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,400
tool creates

2869
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,880
okay analyzers analyzers extract

2870
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,760
information about resources so a common

2871
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,000
one is like what kind of program are you

2872
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,480
running here so here we're running the

2873
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,239
program attributes analyzer and we can

2874
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,320
see that you know it's an x

2875
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,880
86 binary

2876
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,639
so that's kind of cool

2877
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,880
um but what about non-trivial analysis i

2878
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,960
have an answer for that so one kind of

2879
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,800
thing that is interesting that we've

2880
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,199
developed over the past 10 years is we

2881
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:35,760
have like an intermediate representation

2882
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,679
that doesn't reinvent the wheel and you

2883
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,280
know extract everything but it pulls

2884
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,520
from the existing tools that are out

2885
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,639
there so

2886
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:44,159
10 years ago item might have been the

2887
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:45,520
go-to tool

2888
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,360
but right now

2889
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,920
yeah some people can't they either don't

2890
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,560
want to pay for it or they

2891
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,880
can't pay for it

2892
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,920
or like you run into a weird like

2893
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,400
architecture that ida like kind of

2894
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,639
shits to bed on yeah

2895
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,639
supports and that's some reason that

2896
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:06,000
really sucks when you have to rewrite

2897
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,719
all your code as a gigascript

2898
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:10,560
but with ofrac you don't have to all you

2899
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,159
need to do is change the back end you're

2900
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:14,960
using so you can choose from geija or

2901
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,440
binary ninja we recently added anger

2902
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:18,960
does anyone know what that other one is

2903
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,960
there

2904
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:22,800
the fourth one that's actually the logo

2905
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,960
for capstone yeah

2906
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,960
so we use capstone too as well and you

2907
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,719
know ida a beautiful lady

2908
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:32,480
so then the next category of uh

2909
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:35,199
components are modifiers um and this is

2910
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:36,480
an important one because this is where

2911
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,679
ofrac is going beyond what most other re

2912
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,080
tools offer uh because ofrac lets you

2913
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,520
actually modify firmware in a

2914
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,440
straightforward way

2915
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,199
so modifier components as the name

2916
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,440
implies modify a resource and if this

2917
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,679
sounds vague yes that's because it is

2918
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:53,599
modifiers can be as simple as just

2919
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:55,520
changing a few bytes they can be as

2920
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,320
complex as compiling and injecting and

2921
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:01,280
relinking a function into an existing

2922
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,280
binary without even knowing the source

2923
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,719
code that that binary was originally

2924
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:06,000
built with

2925
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,199
so

2926
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,679
this is an example of a relatively

2927
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:10,639
simple

2928
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,280
modifier for string replace that's what

2929
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,199
you saw in the in the video at the very

2930
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,360
start find and replace the string how

2931
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:20,239
much simpler can it get

2932
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,679
and this is what the implementation

2933
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,679
looks like uh it's a simple

2934
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:24,960
implementation to do a simple

2935
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,679
modification

2936
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:29,360
cool so what about if i want to put new

2937
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,520
code directly into existing binary and

2938
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,119
so i think this is the one thing that

2939
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:34,719
you know ofrack has kind of you know

2940
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:38,080
taken forward from frack so

2941
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,119
i don't know about you but i really

2942
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:41,920
don't like assembly

2943
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,760
i'm being honest i like to write my

2944
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,000
patches in c c is easier to look at to

2945
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,040
read

2946
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,080
so

2947
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,599
we've developed this pretty cool thing

2948
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:50,719
that i think you'll like called the

2949
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:53,040
patch maker it basically allows you to

2950
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,040
write c code and inject it into the

2951
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,119
binary where you want to inject it and

2952
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,119
you can link against existing symbols in

2953
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:00,960
the binary

2954
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,320
it's pretty cool and it just kind of

2955
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,840
works and allows you to write code that

2956
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,840
someone else can read

2957
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,440
audit and you know validate that it

2958
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,360
works as well

2959
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:14,000
so the patch maker um here's a diagram

2960
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:14,960
but we can talk about it later

2961
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:17,760
afterwards so basically we're using the

2962
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,880
existing utility of linkers to situate

2963
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,560
our code and link against the existing

2964
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,159
binary and then inject it where we want

2965
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:26,239
to and all the symbols you know just

2966
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:28,080
kind of work out magically yeah we did

2967
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,440
all the work of reading the linker

2968
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:30,960
documentation and figuring out how to

2969
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,560
link your scripts that you guys don't

2970
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,960
have to yeah and the other thing we do

2971
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,280
is we use the same way we disassemble

2972
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,679
things we can assemble and compile using

2973
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,679
a bunch of tools so from the left we

2974
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:42,400
have

2975
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,880
well it's easy it says gcc

2976
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,560
what's this dragon anyone know llvm okay

2977
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,560
the triangle

2978
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,360
keystone and show of hands who knows

2979
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,320
vbcc

2980
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,320
no

2981
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,239
so this is where we do a big shout out

2982
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:03,280
to dr volkl barthelman

2983
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,119
his website looks like it's from the 80s

2984
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:06,239
if you have really good vision you can

2985
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:09,440
see his last update was in may of 2022.

2986
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,159
and it's this really cool compiler

2987
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:14,320
that supports

2988
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,440
a big list of architectures and

2989
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,760
and it's got great documentation even

2990
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,840
describing how to extend it for new

2991
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,280
architectures

2992
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,560
yeah that's one of the nice things of

2993
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,760
oprah we

2994
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,119
encounter a new architecture we

2995
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,119
integrate this tool and then you know

2996
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:30,880
about dr volkl and you can use this

2997
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,199
amazing compiler as well

2998
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,599
yeah it saved us like a long night yeah

2999
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:37,760
yeah

3000
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,840
um and so the last category of

3001
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,920
components we'll talk about are packers

3002
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,080
um and this is usually the last step of

3003
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:46,560
this like unpack modify repack

3004
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,880
uh procedure and so packer components

3005
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,800
are like the opposite of unpackers uh

3006
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,080
they kind of zoom out uh you know and

3007
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,440
and pack up all of the children into the

3008
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,520
parent resource making up any sort of

3009
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,360
fix-ups that needs to be done a common

3010
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:04,639
one is like recalculating checksums um

3011
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,159
or or uh you know recompressing some

3012
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:09,520
some data

3013
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,280
so this is what lets it be kind of a

3014
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:14,560
reversible modification the r in ofrac

3015
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,320
and that's super helpful because like

3016
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:18,800
when you get the checksum wrong

3017
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,560
you flash the device and then the device

3018
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,280
bricks that's not a good feeling

3019
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,440
um and that kind of stuff's hard to like

3020
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,199
you can make get it bad pretty easily

3021
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,800
yeah so it's much more convenient

3022
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,719
convenient to just in one line say

3023
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,320
resource dot pack

3024
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,159
and then ofrac will just handle the rest

3025
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:35,760
of that for you

3026
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,840
this is an example of a packer

3027
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,360
implementation

3028
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:41,119
it's a pretty simple one just

3029
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:44,800
recompressing with with bzip

3030
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,040
yeah yeah so we're showing you simple

3031
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,119
examples so they fit on the screen but i

3032
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:50,960
think you can use your imagination to

3033
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,800
see like you can really implement

3034
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,520
anything as a unpack or a packer

3035
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,199
and we have some pretty complicated ones

3036
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:59,360
that we use as well yeah

3037
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,360
so now we'll take you through some of

3038
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:03,360
the use cases that we've used ofrac for

3039
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,440
so why would you want to use ofrac when

3040
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,119
would you want to use ofrac

3041
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:09,520
um so the first case that we'll talk

3042
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,679
about is exploring a binary

3043
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,480
okay

3044
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,239
so in this video right here we're using

3045
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:21,040
the gui to explore binary so we see that

3046
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,199
we have an iso image and we can click

3047
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:25,360
through the nice documentation

3048
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,280
and i'm oh sweet i have an unpacker for

3049
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,040
that awesome i do not have to know

3050
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,119
anything about it i just keep exploring

3051
02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:32,960
so i hit unpack

3052
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,520
and then it unpacks it cool

3053
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,119
all right what is this

3054
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:39,440
oh it looks like a folder

3055
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,960
okay

3056
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:43,520
oh that looks like a text file

3057
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,679
let's identify it oh that looks better i

3058
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,000
guess it's a hash there

3059
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,119
you can tell i don't know this binder

3060
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:50,400
very well but i don't need to i'm using

3061
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,639
ofrac okay

3062
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:55,040
okay identify that

3063
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,599
okay so

3064
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:01,119
oh what's that interesting

3065
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,199
if you want to see more of the gui we

3066
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:05,920
have it at our table demo in the corner

3067
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,599
can i unpack this

3068
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:09,280
doesn't seem to work

3069
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,000
okay let's move on what else do i have

3070
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:12,960
hmm

3071
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,960
oh that looks like a gzip i'm just gonna

3072
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:16,960
identify it

3073
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,719
yeah unpack that i know i have an

3074
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:21,840
unpacker for that

3075
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,159
and notice that the entropy and

3076
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,599
magnitude view on the right you can kind

3077
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:26,560
of see

3078
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,599
what kind of binary you're dealing with

3079
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,239
so here huh that's kind of interesting

3080
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:33,040
well

3081
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,639
okay different entry view it doesn't

3082
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:38,000
really look like it's compressed

3083
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:39,920
the yellow is a lot of ascii characters

3084
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,679
in the byte class so lots of ascii in

3085
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:42,480
there

3086
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,719
huh that's pretty cool

3087
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:47,119
so if i identify that

3088
02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:49,280
cpio file system

3089
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,880
and i'm a noob i have no idea what a

3090
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,079
cpio is so i can read the docs

3091
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:56,480
and see that oh ofrac has a pack or an

3092
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,920
unpacker for that all right let's keep

3093
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:00,159
going

3094
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,639
so notice all these steps are you know

3095
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:04,560
very simple but the chaining together of

3096
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,480
it is really where the beauty of this

3097
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:09,040
lies because now we're three levels deep

3098
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,079
into this

3099
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:12,000
okay that's a file system

3100
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
let's see what we have

3101
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,320
all right s bin let's find a binary in

3102
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,559
here

3103
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,400
so in like the battle days you'd be

3104
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,400
doing this with like several different

3105
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,199
window terminals uh terminal windows so

3106
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:26,719
we're two minutes in and i already have

3107
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:28,800
like explored pretty far and now i'm

3108
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,400
inside of an elf

3109
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:33,440
and i'm just going for the code section

3110
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,520
all right let's get those functions in

3111
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,520
basic blocks

3112
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,920
so i'll use unpack recursively it'll get

3113
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:42,719
the complex block then the basic block

3114
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:44,800
and then the instruction complex block

3115
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:45,920
is what we call

3116
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,560
function yeah

3117
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,880
start poking around while uh so in this

3118
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,880
case we're using binary ninja the same

3119
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,639
thing would work using the ida or gija

3120
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,320
back end

3121
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,440
and when it happens now now we can look

3122
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,440
at it oh it's kind of cool we get the

3123
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,040
symbols

3124
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,199
when the back end knows about it

3125
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:06,880
and when it doesn't we also see it

3126
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,159
doesn't all right let's take a look at a

3127
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:10,879
complex block

3128
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,599
cool all right

3129
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:15,040
so that's kind of an interesting use

3130
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:16,079
case

3131
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:18,079
one more we wanted to show i guess that

3132
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:20,400
would you can take it away yep

3133
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,719
so this is another uh binary which

3134
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:24,560
starts out as a mystery to ofrac at

3135
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,480
least

3136
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,520
and so again we run the the first step

3137
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,320
will be to identify it

3138
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,079
you can see on the right in the minimap

3139
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,159
it's a very high entropy file and indeed

3140
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:38,639
after identifying it it's a zip archive

3141
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:41,920
um so now after

3142
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:44,719
within that zip there's an apk file

3143
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:46,560
which oprah has support for and we can

3144
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,960
verify that by jumping over to the docs

3145
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:49,840
there

3146
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,159
we see that there's a apk packer apk

3147
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:55,119
unpacker

3148
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:57,040
so now when we unpack ofrac should

3149
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,040
automatically find that unpacker and run

3150
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,239
it

3151
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:01,679
and we can also

3152
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,360
check uh

3153
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,599
what tool we actually are using under

3154
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:07,920
the hood to to understand these apk

3155
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,639
files um you know again the theme i keep

3156
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:11,599
saying it

3157
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:13,199
you know don't reinvent the wheel use

3158
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:14,560
the existing tools that are already

3159
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,239
great at doing this stuff

3160
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:19,280
um so now that the apk file is unpacked

3161
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,560
we can keep uh exploring what's inside

3162
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,920
of it

3163
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,000
so there's several text files like the

3164
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,480
manifest xml the the yaml here

3165
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:32,800
and yeah we can just keep poking around

3166
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,320
inside here

3167
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,960
mostly text files that we're looking at

3168
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,119
um

3169
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:40,960
and what we can actually do

3170
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,040
because these are text files

3171
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:46,320
we can run the string replace modifier

3172
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,800
that we showed you earlier

3173
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:51,520
so that should be happening in a second

3174
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,119
yeah so we can replace the file name

3175
02:08:53,119 --> 02:08:55,520
that's that's stored here within the apk

3176
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:58,639
file um

3177
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,320
yeah we have the ability to modify that

3178
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,000
straight from the gui

3179
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,960
again replace everything with summer con

3180
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,400
don't null terminate otherwise the

3181
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,920
packer will choke

3182
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:10,560
right pro tip

3183
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:11,599
um

3184
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:13,520
and there we go so we see that the text

3185
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:15,440
is updated in the gui and then the thing

3186
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:18,639
is when we hit pack on this apk it's

3187
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:20,719
going to you know just run the apk

3188
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,880
packer and then you get an apk with your

3189
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,719
changes that have taken place

3190
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:25,520
um

3191
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,199
and that you know you're ready to use

3192
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:28,320
that

3193
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,159
however you want and with this this

3194
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:31,440
packer is kind of cool that will work

3195
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,199
not only on text but also on the smallie

3196
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:35,040
files so you'll get the modified

3197
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,199
functionality of the apk

3198
02:09:37,199 --> 02:09:38,159
and

3199
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:39,360
you pack it up and download it you're

3200
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,560
ready to go

3201
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,719
pretty cool okay

3202
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:44,560
um

3203
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,400
so that's use case one explorer use case

3204
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:49,440
two break things

3205
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,480
so

3206
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,599
[Music]

3207
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:52,960
sometimes i don't like when my

3208
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,119
executables execute so

3209
02:09:55,119 --> 02:09:56,560
let's say i want to take the load

3210
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,520
program header and make it

3211
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,599
non-executable

3212
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:01,679
so we can do that and this is how you do

3213
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:02,960
it with ofrac

3214
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,119
so you get the elf view

3215
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,760
you search for the load program header

3216
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,480
and you make it non-executable

3217
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,840
using the elf program header modifier

3218
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,840
so not execute

3219
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,679
permission

3220
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:21,760
then you dump it

3221
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:23,040
and then

3222
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,040
what happens when you run this

3223
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:28,280
any ideas

3224
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:33,199
all right nothing happens yeah segfault

3225
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:35,119
core dumped

3226
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:36,320
yeah what do you mean the program

3227
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,239
doesn't run that sucks but if you want

3228
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:39,599
to break things you can do it with oprah

3229
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:42,159
too

3230
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:44,719
um and the third use case is modifying

3231
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:47,360
firmware um so

3232
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,360
so we have some frac veterans here so

3233
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,040
this is an oldie but a goo but a goodie

3234
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,440
we put in here so now we're booting uh

3235
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,280
cisco router

3236
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,800
and we're looking at you know what's

3237
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,960
coming up on the screen

3238
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,719
prints a bunch of things well that's

3239
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,320
kind of cool this product contains

3240
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:03,360
crypto

3241
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:06,880
i guess i can't export it okay

3242
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,719
so what if i want to export my router

3243
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:12,239
firmware well

3244
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:14,800
with frac you can use it and this file

3245
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,159
is pretty cool i know it's really old

3246
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:18,239
but it's an elf

3247
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:20,320
with really high entropy

3248
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,719
look at this over there wow look at that

3249
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:25,840
what's going on here

3250
02:11:27,199 --> 02:11:29,360
so i click into it and this one section

3251
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,280
has really high entropy

3252
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,040
so i analyze it and it's like this

3253
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,840
really big elf section

3254
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:38,880
that's kind of weird look at how big

3255
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,079
that is

3256
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:42,079
and look at the first few bites like

3257
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:44,480
feed face what's going on there

3258
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,159
so identify it

3259
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:48,639
oh cool it's a cisco ios firmware

3260
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:51,040
section

3261
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:53,280
so we've already like identified this

3262
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,360
for you we have on packer for you

3263
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,360
so now if i run that on packer i can

3264
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,880
unpack this this file

3265
02:12:02,079 --> 02:12:03,440
and it's pretty big so it takes a while

3266
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:06,598
to unzip

3267
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:09,040
okay and here oh that looks good cisco

3268
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:11,360
ios firmware so now when i look at the

3269
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,599
entry of this one

3270
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:15,760
it looks a lot better

3271
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:17,840
okay that i see some code there maybe

3272
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,000
some data

3273
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:23,199
all right it's an elf cool

3274
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:24,159
all right i think i found what i'm

3275
02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:26,079
looking for so i'm just going to yolo it

3276
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:28,159
with ofrac

3277
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:29,840
so i want to change that string remember

3278
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,280
it says this product contains

3279
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:33,599
cryptographic material

3280
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:34,719
so

3281
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:36,880
i don't want to have to follow

3282
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,280
the rules the rules yeah

3283
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,840
i want to export my binary

3284
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,360
to canada to a friendly country

3285
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,159
okay

3286
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:49,360
so we've only added in the oh fret gui

3287
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:51,280
the string modifier now but as we

3288
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:52,560
develop this i think you can see the

3289
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:53,840
power of it we're going to be pulling in

3290
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,320
the other modifiers here so this product

3291
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,719
does not contain crypto

3292
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:00,960
full stop at all

3293
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,280
okay

3294
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:05,519
cool

3295
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:09,599
okay so now we're gonna pack it up

3296
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,280
so now let's grab that section

3297
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:17,280
and we did the hard work for you so

3298
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,840
there's like a there's a checksum

3299
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,840
there's a size value

3300
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,520
the l section gets bigger when you

3301
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,520
decompress and compress it so you have

3302
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,239
to like shift all the sections around

3303
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:29,360
once you do it once you don't need to

3304
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:30,800
worry about it like offrack will just

3305
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,159
handle it for you

3306
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:35,759
and then we download the binary

3307
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,760
okay

3308
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,040
there we go

3309
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,360
and we run it and so we sped this up for

3310
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,280
you these things take a while to boot

3311
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:46,560
actually so

3312
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,719
but

3313
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,360
can we export it

3314
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:54,079
oh cool no crypto

3315
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:55,760
awesome

3316
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:59,639
it's canada's lucky day

3317
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:01,360
i think that was

3318
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:03,199
that was used in the demo uh ten years

3319
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:06,480
ago right i think so yeah

3320
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,639
okay but here's where life gets a little

3321
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:09,840
more interesting so if you were at

3322
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:13,280
summercon a year ago you might have seen

3323
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:16,000
dr aung shui and hans on stage talking

3324
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,679
about pew pew

3325
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:19,760
cisco phones

3326
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:23,440
we like to be jerks to cisco phones

3327
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:24,639
and they talked about these two

3328
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:26,079
vulnerabilities they found in the trust

3329
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:27,440
zone implementation of these cisco

3330
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:29,920
phones that kind of make you go well the

3331
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,719
tldrs you can use trusts on the right to

3332
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:33,760
trust zone

3333
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,320
which kind of is not not cool from the

3334
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:38,159
non-secure world from non-secure world

3335
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:39,679
so you can go from non-square world to

3336
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:40,800
secure world

3337
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,199
and so there's this bounce check

3338
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:45,840
that was not checking the right thing so

3339
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,440
the bounce check was not actually being

3340
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:49,119
checked on the thing that was being

3341
02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:51,040
decrypted to so that could allow you to

3342
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,760
degrade into trusts on worlds

3343
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,840
and then like it got better the bounce

3344
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,599
check actually

3345
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:00,639
uh was vulnerable to integer overflow

3346
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:01,920
so even

3347
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,199
if the bounce check was checking the

3348
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:04,639
right thing

3349
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:06,840
the check wasn't good

3350
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,119
yeah so these are slides from the talk a

3351
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:10,800
year ago like are our children learning

3352
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:11,840
look at all these phones on the

3353
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,440
president's desk

3354
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,760
lots of cisco phones

3355
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,520
so one thing we learned since that talk

3356
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,199
is if you look at the phones on this

3357
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,119
guy's desk

3358
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:23,839
what are those things

3359
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,880
yeah no no cisco phones on his desk i

3360
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,800
wonder why hmm

3361
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:31,040
food for thought but anyway we're in

3362
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,400
america so we want to make our phones

3363
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,000
secure

3364
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,440
we reported this to cisco and cisco said

3365
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:39,599
there are no workarounds that address

3366
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:41,280
that vulnerability

3367
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,119
huh

3368
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:45,679
so why can't cisco patch this what do

3369
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,480
you think is it a they don't know how to

3370
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,719
b they don't want to or c

3371
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:53,760
it's not their code

3372
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,000
all of the above okay

3373
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
[Applause]

3374
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:58,960
yeah

3375
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:01,920
well it's kind of interesting they can't

3376
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,599
patch it because it's not their code

3377
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:05,360
maybe they don't want to

3378
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,960
and maybe they don't even know how to

3379
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:07,760
yeah

3380
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,360
it's a it's a buffer overflow so

3381
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:11,599
presumably they shouldn't know how to

3382
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:13,760
fix that but well you would think so but

3383
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,119
the same vulnerability exists in a

3384
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:17,440
different piece of code in 2017.

3385
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:19,520
so huh anyway

3386
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,360
so can we patch it

3387
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,040
oh frack we can

3388
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,719
so this is a video of the memory

3389
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:26,639
interposer which you can see demo on the

3390
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:27,440
back

3391
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:28,639
and what we're doing here is we're

3392
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:31,280
dumping the ddr3

3393
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,679
from the cisco phone on the right

3394
02:16:33,679 --> 02:16:35,840
so here we're cooling a chip

3395
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,478
putting it on the phone

3396
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:40,398
and if you move it really fast when it's

3397
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,799
really cold cold you can grab the bites

3398
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:43,920
off of it

3399
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,599
and throw it into ofrac and see what's

3400
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,120
there

3401
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:47,920
so

3402
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,359
definitely check that out in the back of

3403
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:50,799
the room it's pretty cool

3404
02:16:50,799 --> 02:16:52,638
but with this we can patch this

3405
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:54,638
vulnerability so okay this one's a

3406
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:56,160
little more complicated so buckle up

3407
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,679
folks

3408
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:58,478
okay

3409
02:16:58,478 --> 02:17:00,398
first step is of course as usual to

3410
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:01,519
unpack it

3411
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:02,478
uh

3412
02:17:02,478 --> 02:17:04,478
and in this we see that there's a you

3413
02:17:04,478 --> 02:17:07,599
image um so we can set the memory

3414
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:10,000
mapping by by creating a child that's a

3415
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,638
code region

3416
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:15,280
and then we can unpack that code region

3417
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,439
getting all the functions all the basic

3418
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:19,040
blocks all the instructions leveraging i

3419
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,120
forget if we did this with binary ninja

3420
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,799
or gitra it doesn't really matter yeah

3421
02:17:22,799 --> 02:17:24,638
we switched to binary for this demo

3422
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:26,879
we've done it with with all of them yeah

3423
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:28,799
um and then so we can double check that

3424
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:30,240
the functions we're interested in are

3425
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:31,920
there so these are yeah these are what

3426
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,359
we'll have to patch to actually fix this

3427
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:34,879
vulnerability and this is pretty cool

3428
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:36,318
because this is a labeled database that

3429
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:37,840
we made obviously there are no like

3430
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,840
symbols in there but then once you label

3431
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,280
it you can pull it into frac and use it

3432
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:43,679
there as well

3433
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,120
okay so now we're going to do is we're

3434
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:46,879
going to use the patch maker which we

3435
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:49,679
briefly mentioned earlier for

3436
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:51,120
compiling

3437
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:53,120
patches from source code and placing

3438
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:55,359
them into a binary so the first step is

3439
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:56,718
to configure the tool chain that

3440
02:17:56,718 --> 02:17:58,398
patchmaker will use we mentioned that

3441
02:17:58,398 --> 02:18:00,080
there are several tool chains available

3442
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,280
for it in this case we're going to use

3443
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,558
llvm

3444
02:18:02,558 --> 02:18:04,160
and then we set up some basic

3445
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,558
configuration options for it

3446
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:08,398
like that we will not use the standard

3447
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:09,519
library

3448
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:10,959
it just makes it a bit more difficult to

3449
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:13,040
patch in

3450
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,478
and then we need to define the symbols

3451
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:15,679
that we'll link again so this is one of

3452
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:17,599
the really cool features of patchmaker

3453
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:20,558
is if you are building from source code

3454
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:22,240
a patch and you're going to place it

3455
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,240
into some target binary you want to be

3456
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:25,519
able to call the functions that are

3457
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:27,439
already in that binary you basically

3458
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,000
want to write code that's written in

3459
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,760
just the exact same way as you would

3460
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,000
write code normally as a software

3461
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,280
developer

3462
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,599
and so in order to do that we provide

3463
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:40,160
you a way to to define the symbols in

3464
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,359
the target binary that you're going to

3465
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:42,799
link your code to

3466
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:45,679
so by defining like printf um and handle

3467
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:47,840
ubud crypto smc we can call those

3468
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,280
functions from the c code that we're

3469
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,120
writing for the patch there's no more

3470
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:52,638
like assembly

3471
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:55,439
uh like jump to this address or like fix

3472
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:57,760
up things it's all done through like the

3473
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,519
standard linker interface

3474
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:01,599
so what are our patches

3475
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:03,359
all right so this is our bounce check

3476
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:04,638
patch

3477
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:06,478
so look at that that's in c

3478
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:08,638
i probably would mess that up in c2 but

3479
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:10,558
i have a much better chance of getting a

3480
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:11,599
writing c

3481
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:13,439
than in assembly

3482
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:14,318
and

3483
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:16,160
yeah i'm not an assembly developer if

3484
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:17,359
you are

3485
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:18,879
props to you there's probably a lot of

3486
02:19:18,879 --> 02:19:20,478
really cool jobs out there for you if

3487
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:21,840
you are an assembly developer then

3488
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,280
you'll get some some comfort at the

3489
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:24,718
bottom of the slide we did do a small

3490
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:27,040
assembly patch as well yeah so for this

3491
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:28,478
one all we need to do is make sure we

3492
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:30,558
check the actual

3493
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:32,478
bounds on the right thing to patch it so

3494
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:35,280
we just you know rewrite two of the

3495
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,479
assembly lines there

3496
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,040
and so now what we'll do is we'll

3497
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,398
actually use the function replacement

3498
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:45,760
modifier uh component which takes the

3499
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:47,599
source code information we have it

3500
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:49,760
targets the the target binary that we

3501
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:51,359
want to inject a function into that we

3502
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:53,200
want to replace a function in and we're

3503
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,359
going to replace the original broken and

3504
02:19:55,359 --> 02:19:57,920
vulnerable checkbounds function with our

3505
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:00,479
newly uh newly written

3506
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:02,000
function that we just showed you so wait

3507
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,720
does that mean i write checkbounds.c

3508
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:07,040
i run this and it'll like

3509
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,800
compile it and link it into the binary

3510
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,880
where the bounce check function is yeah

3511
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,479
it'll do exactly that

3512
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,800
that's pretty cool yeah with well not

3513
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,880
one line exactly but several not many

3514
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:19,039
yeah

3515
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:21,760
okay and we'll skip over this one for

3516
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,439
the assembly patch right now it's a

3517
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:26,000
little more manual but the principle is

3518
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,760
the same we know where we want to put

3519
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:30,399
the bytes and so we can use the symbols

3520
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:33,200
to we know it's at offset 24 hex and we

3521
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,359
can basically create segments for that

3522
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:36,960
and then this is us driving the patch

3523
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:39,120
maker this is the god mode where you

3524
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:40,160
know what you're doing you're not going

3525
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:42,240
to mess it up and we can inject those

3526
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,160
bytes where they are and obviously like

3527
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,880
two two line instructions that's pretty

3528
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,560
simple but as your assembly patch gets

3529
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,319
more complicated you might want to have

3530
02:20:50,319 --> 02:20:53,359
that god mode enabled

3531
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:58,560
and then oh the u image repacks it

3532
02:20:58,560 --> 02:20:59,439
so

3533
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:01,040
like trivia what do you need to do with

3534
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:04,399
the image when you repack it

3535
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:07,600
huh

3536
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:09,359
no one even knows there's some stuff

3537
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:11,280
there's like some sizes and crcs up

3538
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,760
there yeah

3539
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:15,200
yeah you might have to recalculate a

3540
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,880
header actually you don't need to do

3541
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,240
that anymore because operac does it for

3542
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:20,720
you so here we are diffing the original

3543
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,760
and

3544
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,520
the modified one oh there's a little

3545
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:25,280
header stuff up there

3546
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,960
and then these are the two instructions

3547
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,040
we we patched and that's the function we

3548
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:30,640
patched there

3549
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:32,160
so yeah

3550
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,319
so that's real-world patching of

3551
02:21:34,319 --> 02:21:36,080
vulnerabilities that

3552
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:40,000
a certain company was not able to patch

3553
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,040
without source code

3554
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,120
and uh the fifth use case for rofrack is

3555
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:48,000
uh

3556
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,479
whatever you want to do with ofrac oh

3557
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:52,960
frack you yeah all right so i think you

3558
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:55,200
get the idea you have unpack

3559
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,040
then you have like you know whatever you

3560
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,160
want to do

3561
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,840
and then you pack it up so we're

3562
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:01,920
interested in seeing what you

3563
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,840
can do with oprah oh frank you

3564
02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:08,319
so if you want to know about ofrac in

3565
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:10,640
the future follow frack.com for updates

3566
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:13,039
and news

3567
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:18,319
oh fine fine fine okay so first half of

3568
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:20,720
august

3569
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:24,399
2022 before defcon okay

3570
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,240
so are we making a commitment

3571
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:28,160
is that a commitment yeah

3572
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,399
okay

3573
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,200
so we're releasing before defcon so

3574
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,040
we're gonna make a stack overflow post

3575
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:36,880
we found some better lawyers but we're

3576
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:38,720
still talking with them but likely you

3577
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,960
know the core python apis will be open

3578
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,240
source

3579
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,880
this oprah gui honestly we've only

3580
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:46,000
started

3581
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,359
oh yeah

3582
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:49,040
we want to make it available for

3583
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,640
download as well but we've been enjoying

3584
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:51,840
users we want you to be able to use it

3585
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,840
too and we're looking forward to some

3586
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:56,479
open source contributions

3587
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,479
um so i think yesterday we were talking

3588
02:22:58,479 --> 02:23:01,200
to some people who like like maco files

3589
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,120
we haven't tackled that yet

3590
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,600
um but you know it's on the list so if

3591
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:08,000
you want to help implement the unpacking

3592
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,040
of maco files that'd be pretty cool

3593
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:14,040
so sign up for notifications release at

3594
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:16,160
www.off.com this is where everyone whips

3595
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,319
out their phones right now and gets the

3596
02:23:18,319 --> 02:23:19,600
qr code

3597
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,840
and we're hiring it's literally like

3598
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:27,439
five letters o f r a c k wait

3599
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:29,200
that's ck

3600
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,560
yeah oh yeah that's right that's right

3601
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,160
but anyway if you want to actually see

3602
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,080
like an actual instance of wolfpack

3603
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,080
running we have it in the corner

3604
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,479
and you can run it on whatever binaries

3605
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:40,880
you bring and it's actually running from

3606
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:42,560
the binary weeks we're extracting from

3607
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,720
the copa robot from trosome from

3608
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:46,880
physical memory on the cisco phone

3609
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:48,399
because we've been to cisco

3610
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:50,000
phones for like a decade and we're

3611
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,000
probably not going to stop so there

3612
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,439
ta-da

3613
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:58,540
that's it

3614
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:01,919
[Applause]

3615
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:04,399
i think we have time for concerns or

3616
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:06,880
questions

3617
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,720
we are hiring for all positions so

3618
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:14,319
security researcher and software

3619
02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:16,880
engineer it kind of takes you know

3620
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:19,040
people who know what all this is

3621
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:20,960
and it takes people who like writing

3622
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:21,840
code

3623
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:23,520
that's not throwaway and that you know

3624
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:24,960
gets committed and runs when someone

3625
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:29,319
checks it out so yeah

3626
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:32,240
good question

3627
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:34,880
i mean it'd be ironic

3628
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:36,479
we're manifesting really hard we've said

3629
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:38,720
it so many times that it just it has to

3630
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,479
happen and we put the o in front for

3631
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:43,840
open so yeah

3632
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:47,280
hopefully in another 10 years there

3633
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:48,880
won't be a summer con talk that's like

3634
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:52,560
oh oh frack ooh frack

3635
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:54,080
that is pretty cool though we should get

3636
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:57,840
that domain yeah okay

3637
02:24:58,319 --> 02:24:59,840
all right well thank you i have some

3638
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,359
dollars up here so if you answer some

3639
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,200
questions i'll give you a dollar

3640
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:04,479
we uh

3641
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,640

uh wearing tracksuits

3664
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,880
and talking about threat intelligence

3665
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:08,160
um let's see i think ian's almost ready

3666
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,640
to come up

3667
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
15 minutes early

3668
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,479
i said judgingly

3669
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:23,680
i i i i hear rustling so that's probably

3670
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,760
a good thing can i get a stool

3671
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,160
uh yeah we can absolutely get you a

3672
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:28,960
stool

3673
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:31,840
we need somewhere to put a baby

3674
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,359
uh there's a stool right next to the

3675
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:34,880
couch

3676
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,399
there's a stool right next to the couch

3677
02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:37,920
in the green room

3678
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:41,120
and it's already got stains on it

3679
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:45,720
which is roughly what you would want

3680
02:26:48,319 --> 02:26:50,160
this entire conference i'm just dragging

3681
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:52,479
stools out yeah

3682
02:26:52,479 --> 02:26:55,120
like it as long as they're metal stools

3683
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:56,479
and not you know

3684
02:26:56,479 --> 02:26:58,880
another kind of stool

3685
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:01,359
uh we should probably

3686
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,920
can you pick that up for a second though

3687
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:06,399
uh the stool i'm gonna get that cable

3688
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,000
out from under it

3689
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,120
or that could be problematic

3690
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,399
you're gonna start running around at

3691
02:27:12,399 --> 02:27:14,399
some point the hardest working manager

3692
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:17,800
business yeah

3693
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:25,120
okay well uh

3694
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:27,680
so ian uh is gonna talk to you guys

3695
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,200
about

3696
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,359
this threat intelligence i i actually

3697
02:27:31,359 --> 02:27:33,200
didn't read the schedule

3698
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:34,319
um i

3699
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:37,199
i can't read so

3700
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:40,640
oh how do i

3701
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:43,120
you i think you want to go back to

3702
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:47,280
whatever was up there there we go i need

3703
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,120
oh this is just screen mirroring it's

3704
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,040
not uh

3705
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:52,080
it's

3706
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,000
it's uh mirroring the screen i need to

3707
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
uh

3708
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:09,720
can i watch you type your password

3709
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:46,358
it's not up on the screen

3710
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,120
i'm just thankful we're not trying to

3711
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,600
join a zoom meeting right now

3712
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:11,280
because that would take much more time

3713
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,720
yeah you think you got to plug that back

3714
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,720
in

3715
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,120
i think you just gotta jiggle it a

3716
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:30,319
little bit it'll be right

3717
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:33,840
yeah i think it's going now

3718
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:38,319
okay that's progress

3719
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,640
all right

3720
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:45,600
are you ready to go i think so

3721
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,359
all right well with that i present to

3722
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:50,560
you ian ruse uh with hackers cutting 99

3723
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:54,479
problems and a threat intelligent one

3724
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,800
everybody

3725
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:07,040

3740
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,680
threat until ain't one

3741
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:40,800
it is

3742
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:44,080
as inflammatory as you think it will be

3743
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,720
and we've got the subtitle here uh if

3744
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,560

3746
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:54,479
tip ain't one

3747
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,560
just let me know what's good is that

3748
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:59,960
good all right

3749
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:02,800
um

3750
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:04,720
so let's see uh

3751
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:07,760
if you don't know who i am

3752
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:10,240
uh this is from a tele

3753
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:12,399
signal sticker pack which is just all

3754
02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:15,280
faces of me that i didn't make but if

3755
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,840
you hang around we can get you access uh

3756
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:20,880
i am a back to back to back

3757
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:23,520
to back uh summercon presenter uh this

3758
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,200
is i think the fourth year in a row i've

3759
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:28,160
done this nonsense i promise i will take

3760
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,840
a break next year

3761
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,040
um

3762
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:33,280
but i mean for my sake as much as yours

3763
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:37,040
uh i also if you're around yesterday i'm

3764
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,439
a pony awards organizer

3765
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:41,520
and but i think more fundamentally to

3766
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:43,520
like the body of this talk i am also an

3767
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:45,680
offensive security researcher

3768
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:48,640
uh and yeah if you want to uh follow me

3769
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:51,600
or send me hate mail after this talk uh

3770
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,920
you can get me at twitter or that's my

3771
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:55,600
work email you can hit me up there as

3772
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,520
well

3773
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,040
so um

3774
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,040
i think uh i need to talk a little bit

3775
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,600
about what this talk

3776
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,040
actually is

3777
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,760
um this is a talk meant to kind of

3778
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:11,120
highlight some observed shortcomings in

3779
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,960
the threat intelligence world from the

3780
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:15,280
perspective of an offensive security

3781
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:16,399
researcher

3782
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:18,560
i'm going to spend some time calling out

3783
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,560
and discussing some of the problems

3784
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:24,479
uh with and really incentive failures in

3785
02:32:24,479 --> 02:32:26,560
uh or that the threat until industry has

3786
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:29,359
been subjected to and then go over some

3787
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:31,840
slightly different approaches on how i

3788
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,920
think we might be able to improve things

3789
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,280
uh

3790
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:38,479
so security and threats to security are

3791
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:40,800
an incredibly broad topic so in order to

3792
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:43,200
kind of scope this down

3793
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,040
i need to make it clear that i am

3794
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,120
talking about a arguably small but

3795
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:49,120
particularly damaging

3796
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:51,600
component of the larger security world

3797
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:55,280
which is zero day vulnerabilities um so

3798
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:57,840
yes i am taking the goal posts that are

3799
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,600
set for threat intelligence

3800
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,280
i am moving them and then i'm

3801
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:03,359
complaining that you're not there so

3802
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:05,680
buckle one um

3803
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:07,600
it's uh but also i mean it's worth

3804
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,120
noting it might actually not even be

3805
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,319
that small um project zero uh very

3806
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:14,800
oftenly uh points out in their yearly

3807
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:17,840
rundowns uh and very humbly as well that

3808
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:19,920
uh it's really very difficult to say

3809
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:21,920
what percentage of compromises occur via

3810
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,600
zero days because you kind of inherently

3811
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:24,479
have

3812
02:33:24,479 --> 02:33:27,359
uh almost no visibility of that space

3813
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:27,730
um

3814
02:33:27,730 --> 02:33:29,040
[Music]

3815
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,920
so i'm gonna be talking a lot about uh

3816
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:34,319
incentive structures during this talk

3817
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:35,680
because while i think there's a lot of

3818
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:37,680
shortcomings in threat intel

3819
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,720
i don't think it's necessarily their

3820
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:42,720
fault

3821
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:43,600
my

3822
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:45,600
hope is that by the end of this talk

3823
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:47,439
that many of you will have some ideas in

3824
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:48,479
your heads

3825
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,960
about some ways that you might be able

3826
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:54,720
to support or even improve the field

3827
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:57,439
so just an example of some of these

3828
02:33:57,439 --> 02:33:59,040
weird incentives

3829
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,600
as i mentioned i'm an offensive security

3830
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:05,760
researcher and a big part of that

3831
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:08,319
sorry i need to

3832
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:11,519
drink from the baby's brain

3833
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:13,280
um

3834
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:15,840
a big part of that is that or part of

3835
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,280
the reason why i enjoy offensive

3836
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,280
security is that i feel like it's always

3837
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,680
had much more straightforward incentives

3838
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:24,160
compared to defensive work which

3839
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:25,840
sounds odd but

3840
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,800
let me walk you through it

3841
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:30,479
an offensive

3842
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:32,720
security researcher uh will always be

3843
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:35,600
trying to find and exploit uh new like

3844
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,760
vulnerabilities uh more than merrier

3845
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:39,840
that's sort of the name of the game

3846
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:41,359
if you make a new thing i want to hack

3847
02:34:41,359 --> 02:34:44,560
into your new thing that's it

3848
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,880
on the other hand if you're a defensive

3849
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:49,280
security practitioner

3850
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:51,120
you will always

3851
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:53,439
be trying to stop vulnerabilities and

3852
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:55,600
systems

3853
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:57,439
kind of half-assed approach at defining

3854
02:34:57,439 --> 02:34:59,920
the entire industry but i think it

3855
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:01,760
maybe holds up

3856
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:03,680
if you succeed at the first

3857
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:07,520
uh you're a national intelligence agency

3858
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,840
more or less uh if you succeed at the

3859
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,720
latter

3860
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,080
you've effectively made yourself

3861
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:13,680
redundant and there's not really a

3862
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,439
reason for you to exist anymore

3863
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:18,080
um so that is like kind of

3864
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:19,920
uh fundamentally

3865
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:21,680
uh one of like the major incentive

3866
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:23,760
failures where it just it's sort of this

3867
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:25,439
like zero-sum game where like there's no

3868
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:29,040
real decent win condition

3869
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:30,399
all right so

3870
02:35:30,399 --> 02:35:33,359
i'm going to put the baby down

3871
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,920
because the next slide is gonna get a

3872
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:38,080
little rowdy

3873
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:38,480
um

3874
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:39,600
[Music]

3875
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,240
okay so look uh threat until is an

3876
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:44,240
abject failure of an industry and it

3877
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:46,560
needs to be completely rebuilt

3878
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:49,280
that's it you know preach

3879
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,479
um the and it again it's not necessarily

3880
02:35:52,479 --> 02:35:54,399
their fault but um they've effectively

3881
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:56,479
built a money printer that spits out

3882
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:57,600
cash

3883
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:58,640
uh

3884
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,080
this is really the important part uh

3885
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,640
when you notify people of ongoing

3886
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:04,399
threats

3887
02:36:04,399 --> 02:36:05,920
ongoing threats

3888
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:07,680
like

3889
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,640
it's it's astounding to me like

3890
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,479
imagine has anyone here been punched in

3891
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:14,080
the head

3892
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,800
i mean i clearly have but oh hell yeah

3893
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:17,920
that was a lot more hands than i

3894
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,680
expected

3895
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:20,880
um

3896
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,800
the uh why why the do you want to

3897
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,720
find out that you've been punched in the

3898
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:27,200
head like do you really need an entire

3899
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,160
like apparatus to come in and notify you

3900
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:32,080
that oh hey by the way

3901
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:34,080
some over there left hook

3902
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:35,760
popped you it's like you're bleeding on

3903
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:38,000
the ground like oh yeah sick thanks this

3904
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:38,960
is good

3905
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:40,800
like i mean uh

3906
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,680
imagine a uh like a boxing match you

3907
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,840
know um you got guys out there they're

3908
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,439
bobbing they're weaving they're popping

3909
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:48,479
shots

3910
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:50,399
some dude suddenly catches like a sick

3911
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:52,000
left hook

3912
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,600
goes down immediately

3913
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,920
in my mind threat intelligence is these

3914
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,600
 up in the rafters with

3915
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:01,439
binoculars they're like oh my god

3916
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:04,479
that guy just got punched in the head

3917
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:06,399
holy

3918
02:37:06,399 --> 02:37:10,080
okay tell me what we're gonna do um

3919
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:10,920
we're gonna

3920
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:12,640
painstakingly

3921
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:15,200
compile all of what we found watching

3922
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:17,840
this dude just get knocked in the noggin

3923
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,920
uh we're going to construct it into a

3924
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:23,439
drm walk pdf with a comprehensive

3925
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:25,680
analysis that says yes this dude did in

3926
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,760
fact get punched in the head and then

3927
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:30,479
for an extra hundred thousand dollars

3928
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:32,000
we'll even tell you which side it came

3929
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,680
from

3930
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,680
all right and then next i'm going to

3931
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,600
hand it to a guy and he's going to go

3932
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,600
running down the stands

3933
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:42,960
past the crowds past the refs pass the

3934
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,520
coaches climb up into the ring and lay

3935
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,280
this little fancy document on top of the

3936
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,040
knocked out like dude on the

3937
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:50,000
stage

3938
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,280
like

3939
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,439
it's insane to me i i am

3940
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:56,880
i'm ironically i am sick and tired of

3941
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:58,960
reacting to threats

3942
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,640
it drives me in saying that as an

3943
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,479
industry our holistic approach to

3944
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:05,280
mitigating the damage caused by malware

3945
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:07,760
is fundamentally reliant

3946
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:10,080
on damage happening in the first place i

3947
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:12,720
think it's completely unacceptable

3948
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,640
it's like waiting to build fire stations

3949
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:16,399
after half your city is on fire

3950
02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:17,359
it doesn't

3951
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:18,960
make any sense

3952
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:21,439
um but again like there are fundamental

3953
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:22,880
reasons why

3954
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,800
we arrived at this point

3955
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:27,600
um so i i stole some slides here

3956
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,920
from actual threat until companies so i

3957
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:32,640
can bully them

3958
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,920
should i grab the other one okay now

3959
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:43,120
we're good um

3960
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:45,520
okay so i i don't know who this company

3961
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:46,640
is i'm kind of glad you can't

3962
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:48,000
necessarily see their name i don't want

3963
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,200
to like really

3964
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:51,359
beat people up too hard or anything

3965
02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:53,760
um but like let's deconstruct a few of

3966
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,040
these right

3967
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,359
um so like what are you getting out of

3968
02:38:57,359 --> 02:38:59,680
this uh high level information on

3969
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,280
changing risk

3970
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,880
i don't think that means anything um

3971
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:06,000
details of a specific incoming attack

3972
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,240
again relies inherently on some other

3973
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,640
guy getting the kicked at him first

3974
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:12,800
in my mind that's unacceptable like this

3975
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,520
isn't this isn't scale uh attacker

3976
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:17,920
methodologies tools and tactics

3977
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:18,720
um

3978
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:21,359
i actually love this one kind of because

3979
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:24,319
i i have this weird up pet theory

3980
02:39:24,319 --> 02:39:25,760
that uh

3981
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:27,520
most attribution

3982
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:29,600
in the world that relies on stuff like

3983
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,280
ttps

3984
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:34,000
is actually just over signaling by

3985
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,240
whoever conducted the behavior

3986
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:39,040
there's some very strict exceptions uh

3987
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:42,080
which are tattooed on uh jags arm i

3988
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,359
think um

3989
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:44,880
but uh

3990
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:47,600
for the most part like i think we've

3991
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:49,200
one of the problems with threat intel is

3992
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,040
it ends up building this feedback loop

3993
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,600
with adversaries where their only option

3994
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,520
is to improve to a point

3995
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,600
and at a certain point that escapes the

3996
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,040
feedback loop that threat intelligence

3997
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:00,479
has visibility of

3998
02:40:00,479 --> 02:40:02,560
and it ends up building these like

3999
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,560
superbugs

4000
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,000
and then the rest of it you have to

4001
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,479
assume is kind of on purpose

4002
02:40:08,479 --> 02:40:09,439
um

4003
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:11,439
and then yeah like indicator of specific

4004
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:13,120
malware um

4005
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:15,840
again i mean i'll be talking a bit about

4006
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:17,359
why that might be kind of a more

4007
02:40:17,359 --> 02:40:19,279
interesting angle to lean into

4008
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:20,560
but uh

4009
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:22,160
for the most part a lot of that relies

4010
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:25,520
on like prior compromises

4011
02:40:26,560 --> 02:40:29,439
oh wait there's another one

4012
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,760
okay so

4013
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:35,040
crowdstrike is um arguably uh one of the

4014
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,560
least bad

4015
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:38,479
companies in this regard and i'm not

4016
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:39,760
just saying that because there's a few

4017
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:41,040
of you in the crowd

4018
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,720
um

4019
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:45,520
but uh it kind of ends up for one i mean

4020
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:47,120
all these fall into the exact same

4021
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:48,880
failings and shortcomings of the prior

4022
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:51,439
slide that i just called out

4023
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:53,120
but what's even more egregious with

4024
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:54,800
organizations like this is that while

4025
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,720
they are the best in the business it

4026
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:58,800
ends up creating a pay-to-play model

4027
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:00,640
that leaves the most vulnerable people

4028
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,399
in the world out to dry

4029
02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:04,640
and again that doesn't really move you

4030
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:06,399
towards solving the threat or ending the

4031
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,160
threat it just creates an environment

4032
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,040
where

4033
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:10,800
yeah if you pay enough like you might

4034
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:12,720
mitigate most of it but

4035
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,679
again very low visibility

4036
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,560
all right i'm back over here

4037
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:24,720
so there's some things to remember here

4038
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:25,050
um

4039
02:41:25,050 --> 02:41:26,319
[Music]

4040
02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:28,479
for one thing uh people really don't

4041
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:31,200
take software exploitation seriously

4042
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:33,520
and uh

4043
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,520
it's and i know like this is a hard

4044
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,760
thing to assume when for a crowd like

4045
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:39,760
this right like in my mind

4046
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:42,160
we're all a bunch of hammers

4047
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:44,160
and we think nails are the most

4048
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:46,800
important thing in the world right um

4049
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:48,560
that is not actually true for the rest

4050
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:50,560
of the world uh i don't know how many of

4051
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:53,200
you guys are folks have been on like

4052
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:54,880
dates and then try to explain what the

4053
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:58,000
 malware or vulnerabilities are it

4054
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,640
doesn't really land uh with people that

4055
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:04,080
are trying to like make rent um

4056
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:06,640
so an example of this though uh

4057
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:09,040
when a plane crashes

4058
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:12,080
like you know bermuda triangle stuff

4059
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,800
the faa will bend over backwards to make

4060
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:16,399
painstakingly

4061
02:42:16,399 --> 02:42:19,200
public increase into exactly what went

4062
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,760
wrong and how and then they will take

4063
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:24,000
those findings and they will bludgeon

4064
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,800
the airline industry into submission

4065
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:29,359
until those problems become not problems

4066
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:31,520
anymore and everyone becomes safer and

4067
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,000
because of that flying through the air

4068
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,840
which is a absurd proposition when you

4069
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,680
think about what's actually going on is

4070
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:40,640
one of the safest ways to travel

4071
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:44,080
meanwhile when someone in 1996

4072
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:47,200
that's three years after i was born

4073
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,960
writes an article about fundamental

4074
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:50,240
insecurities in one of the most

4075
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:52,000
prominent programming languages in the

4076
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,040
world

4077
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:57,600
we half-ass some mitigations aslr um

4078
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:59,359
and uh

4079
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:01,600
we just keep on rolling uh if we really

4080
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,319
gave a about security we probably

4081
02:43:04,319 --> 02:43:06,640
wouldn't use c anymore like

4082
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:09,600
hot take um

4083
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:10,399
uh

4084
02:43:10,399 --> 02:43:12,399
and again like i need to

4085
02:43:12,399 --> 02:43:14,240
make a point of saying like credit words

4086
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:17,040
do like these are it is very difficult

4087
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:19,680
to go the extra mile here um or at least

4088
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,439
in the way that i'm asking i

4089
02:43:21,439 --> 02:43:22,960
move some goal posts

4090
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,960
uh they really don't have the tools or

4091
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:26,720
the incentives to prevent oday from

4092
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:29,760
being developed in the first place

4093
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:31,760
stuff like heuristics are okay at

4094
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,760
catching low hanging fruit and if you're

4095
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,120
very very lucky they might catch some

4096
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:36,640
innocuous threat that when pulled on

4097
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,399
dumps a ton of uh

4098
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:40,479
sophisticated oday on your head

4099
02:43:40,479 --> 02:43:41,600
but

4100
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:43,120
it's unreliable

4101
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,560
and again it doesn't really mitigate the

4102
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:46,479
truth rat um the oda is still being

4103
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:49,040
developed it's still getting thrown

4104
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:51,439
um and i i really don't mean for this

4105
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:53,840
talk to just be about abusing uh through

4106
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:56,000
intelligence um i've actually discussed

4107
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,319
a lot of these issues with uh honestly

4108
02:43:58,319 --> 02:43:59,920
some of the most highly skilled

4109
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:02,160
technical and intelligent people in the

4110
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:04,800
industry many of whom are in this room

4111
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:06,319
and uh

4112
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:08,160
a lot of people kind of share very

4113
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:09,600
similar grievances but they're not

4114
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:11,760
necessarily in positions where they can

4115
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:14,560
affect changes

4116
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:17,040
and again like i need to get project

4117
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:18,720
there uh i need to give credit to

4118
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:21,040
project zero for honestly being way too

4119
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:23,680
humble in their uh yearly reports

4120
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,080
um it's like i said it's very difficult

4121
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:28,960
to have any visibility of what's going

4122
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:29,840
on

4123
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:32,479
and as a result it becomes very almost

4124
02:44:32,479 --> 02:44:34,240
impossible to get a positive feedback

4125
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,040
loop on any mitigations you're making to

4126
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,920
the inherently opaque industry like oda

4127
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:41,279
development

4128
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:43,120
and i have this

4129
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:45,439
 post i designed

4130
02:44:45,439 --> 02:44:47,279
which i think kind of illustrates it i

4131
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:49,200
put this as sort of a subtweet as a

4132
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:51,920
reply to an actual tweet um

4133
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:55,520
to like maddie stone or something um

4134
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:56,720
where it

4135
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:58,479
kind of highlights the

4136
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:00,399
weird inefficiencies everyone ends up

4137
02:45:00,399 --> 02:45:02,160
with these very different perspectives

4138
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:03,359
on where

4139
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:05,040
uh compromises are happening and it

4140
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:06,640
makes it difficult to have a holistic

4141
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:09,279
understanding of what the is going

4142
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:12,000
on in the first place

4143
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,520
um

4144
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:15,279
so let's talk about like some of the

4145
02:45:15,279 --> 02:45:17,439
ways you might actually be able to uh

4146
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:19,920
like quote discover odays in the wild

4147
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:20,270
um

4148
02:45:20,270 --> 02:45:22,560
[Music]

4149
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:26,240
yeah i love a sled um

4150
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:28,399
can you like interpret what like three

4151
02:45:28,399 --> 02:45:32,240
of these options are just from this

4152
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:33,920
um well i mean two of them are the same

4153
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:36,000
one

4154
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,319
but uh

4155
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:40,000
for one thing i mean i i think like in

4156
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,160
the wild is immediately a pretty stupid

4157
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:44,560
uh term to use

4158
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:46,080
if all the compromises happen in the

4159
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,240
wild we should simply

4160
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:50,720
take computers out of the wild

4161
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,080
hot take

4162
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:53,920
i think uh perry

4163
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:56,640
and some of we have this uh funny

4164
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:57,439
uh

4165
02:45:57,439 --> 02:46:00,240
we're all we're on one big wham you know

4166
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:02,240
everything's connected

4167
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:05,600
it's a small win after all

4168
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,359
um

4169
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:08,640
but uh

4170
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:10,319
yeah let's talk about like how do you

4171
02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:12,319
actually find malware um

4172
02:46:12,319 --> 02:46:13,359
so

4173
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:15,520
a huge problem i have is that

4174
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,439
a lot of these conversations tend to

4175
02:46:17,439 --> 02:46:19,760
dive into very deep analysis of the

4176
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:22,319
complicated inner workings of malware

4177
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:23,920
but they tend to ignore the major

4178
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:25,439
question of how you found that malware

4179
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:26,800
in the first place

4180
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:29,359
um which is maybe an important thread to

4181
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:31,200
pull on if i had more time to talk about

4182
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,560
it uh

4183
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:36,000
but here's a couple options um

4184
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,640
the my mouse there you are um

4185
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:40,880
let's say your heuristics were able to

4186
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,640
catch a straight part of a chain that

4187
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:45,439
went investigated yielded uh several

4188
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:47,359
sophisticated exploits

4189
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:48,319
um

4190
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,880
this probably happens i doubt it happens

4191
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:53,920
that often relatively speaking

4192
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,399
and if you ask any internal red teamer

4193
02:46:56,399 --> 02:46:58,080
about how difficult it is to modify a

4194
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:00,960
payload to qualify as evasive they'll

4195
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:03,200
communicate to you how unreliable this

4196
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:05,439
mechanism is

4197
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:07,439
that's not to like on it too much i

4198
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:08,960
think like these sorts of approaches

4199
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:11,279
absolutely qualify as due diligence

4200
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:13,040
um

4201
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:15,840
but uh it's not necessarily again an

4202
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,439
effort to really solve the problem in

4203
02:47:17,439 --> 02:47:18,720
the first place

4204
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:21,680
um another option uh let's say you are

4205
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:23,520
researching zero-day vulnerabilities and

4206
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:25,439
when you discover it you write analysis

4207
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:27,600
tooling that looks for instances of it

4208
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,439
in the wild

4209
02:47:29,439 --> 02:47:31,680
this is kind of the project zero

4210
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:32,640
approach

4211
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:33,600
uh

4212
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:35,439
once you do this you

4213
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:37,279
generally need to disclose the

4214
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:39,279
vulnerabilities to the vendor which

4215
02:47:39,279 --> 02:47:41,200
again is what p0 does

4216
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:42,080
um

4217
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:44,319
and but in order to do this it relies on

4218
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:46,640
some of the most highly skilled hackers

4219
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:48,720
in the world

4220
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:50,160
and it

4221
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:53,279
puts you in a direct arms race with

4222
02:47:53,279 --> 02:47:55,200
nation states that have near unlimited

4223
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,120
budgets

4224
02:47:57,120 --> 02:47:58,240
so the

4225
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:01,279
it really doesn't scale effectively it

4226
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:03,359
also doesn't make you any money

4227
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:05,120
um which is maybe the more important

4228
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:07,279
point here uh you could also go out

4229
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:09,680
hunting for malware um let's say you're

4230
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:11,600
very good at leveraging honey pots you

4231
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:12,800
can go to places where you think

4232
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:14,880
exploitation might be happening and then

4233
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:16,640
you reverse what you find there

4234
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:18,240
uh this would probably require some

4235
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:20,000
heuristics to even know that something

4236
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,319
sketchy is happening in the first place

4237
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:23,359
um

4238
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:25,200
but let's say like your ram gets maxed

4239
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:27,600
when you like visit a sketchy website

4240
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,680
because you're just getting heap

4241
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:30,720
sprayed

4242
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:31,840
um

4243
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:33,040
you might be able to assume that

4244
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:35,760
something's happening but even then uh

4245
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:37,760
being able to evaluate what happened and

4246
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:39,439
capture a sample is a technical

4247
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:41,439
nightmare um

4248
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:46,160
another option uh someone snitched um

4249
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:50,000
some of y'all i know tonight i bet

4250
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,760
um i can't tell you how many times that

4251
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,760
i personally have been out at a bar and

4252
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,680
someone was just like oh my god dude i

4253
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,760
found this really cool

4254
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,920
exploit in this thing no one knows about

4255
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:01,520
it yet but i'm telling you and i'm like

4256
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,520
oh that's neat dude like how's

4257
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:05,200
it work

4258
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:07,040
um

4259
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,399
uh

4260
02:49:08,399 --> 02:49:10,720
it's valid it works um

4261
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:13,120
when yeah actually

4262
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:14,640
um

4263
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:17,359
let's say uh another option spicier

4264
02:49:17,359 --> 02:49:19,680
option uh you know who's writing it and

4265
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:22,319
you uh show up outside their door you

4266
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:24,640
kick in that door and you find the

4267
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:27,600
volumes and the devs red-handed

4268
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:30,000
bass cool

4269
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
let's say you then conduct reverse

4270
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,600
engineering of those findings by

4271
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,680
reversing the engineer's fingers until

4272
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:38,880
they tell you everything that they know

4273
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:42,000
this is uh you know again kind of

4274
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,840
 baller but uh probably not an

4275
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:45,760
option to you unless you're a jsoc black

4276
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:47,279
ops like team

4277
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:49,040
um

4278
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:50,560
uh it's probably not in the cards for

4279
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:52,479
you but again like this isn't really

4280
02:49:52,479 --> 02:49:54,319
like a comfy precedent that i would like

4281
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:56,240
to advocate for or set

4282
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:58,960
um for a variety of reasons

4283
02:49:58,960 --> 02:49:59,920
um

4284
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:01,840
but like what about like maybe a

4285
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,920
non-kinetic version of the above right

4286
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:06,399
uh you literally like they operate on

4287
02:50:06,399 --> 02:50:08,160
infrastructure if they operate in the

4288
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:10,000
21st century

4289
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,080
let's say you hack into that system and

4290
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:13,439
poke around a bit

4291
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,520
uh this has the same ethical problems of

4292
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:16,880
okay now you know about the vaughan but

4293
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:18,080
you don't want to smoke your access

4294
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:19,520
which can be a very difficult place to

4295
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:21,279
find yourself in

4296
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:23,359
but it would still be very interesting

4297
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:25,439
uh if these sorts of things were

4298
02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:27,200
happening uh could

4299
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:30,080
create a lot of options um

4300
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:32,080
but like what happens next like let's

4301
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:34,000
say i'm able to leverage

4302
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,080
one of these options and i'm actually

4303
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:38,399
able to find something cool

4304
02:50:38,399 --> 02:50:39,279
um

4305
02:50:39,279 --> 02:50:41,359
so i i've been accused as larping as

4306
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:43,279
threatened fell before so i figured i'd

4307
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:45,439
throw a bone to the haters and uh just

4308
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:46,880
do it

4309
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:50,000
um i ranted earlier about how i can't

4310
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,600
stand that we're not able to be more

4311
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:54,080
proactive in tackling threats

4312
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:56,479
uh that we all know are out there but

4313
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:58,080
like again like let's say i am

4314
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,000
threatened el and i decide to take some

4315
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:03,279
of my own advice to heart and you know

4316
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:05,120
be more proactive

4317
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,640
um

4318
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:07,520
so

4319
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:09,680
i'm just gonna like let's assume i find

4320
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,520
a vulnerability one way or the other

4321
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:14,240
from that whole list i just gave you

4322
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:15,120
um

4323
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,640
and it's

4324
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:19,359
pretty good uh i find a very nasty

4325
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:21,680
exploitable vulnerability and a major

4326
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,279
software vendor

4327
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:25,359
named like uh

4328
02:51:25,359 --> 02:51:29,840
macro soft or uh micro hard or

4329
02:51:29,840 --> 02:51:32,319
maybe not that one

4330
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:33,359
um

4331
02:51:33,359 --> 02:51:35,520
but what are my options now

4332
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:37,520
uh okay so let's just say i found this

4333
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:39,279
vulnerability through through uh

4334
02:51:39,279 --> 02:51:42,319
somewhat illicit means

4335
02:51:42,319 --> 02:51:45,520
if i disclose it to a software vendor

4336
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:47,680
i am no longer the cutting edge threat

4337
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:49,120
intel platform

4338
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:51,359
it's a very important

4339
02:51:51,359 --> 02:51:53,520
thing to realize here um

4340
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,160
sure now everyone is secure but my

4341
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:58,800
customers are now paying a premium

4342
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:00,479
for what everyone else has already been

4343
02:52:00,479 --> 02:52:02,800
inoculated against so that's a negative

4344
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:04,560
incentive structure right there

4345
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:05,600
um

4346
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,200
also uh there might actually be some

4347
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:09,279
operational incentives just sitting on

4348
02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:10,960
the bug as well

4349
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:12,880
it could possibly inflict more damage to

4350
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:15,439
the adversary by disabling it after it

4351
02:52:15,439 --> 02:52:18,210
hits the mythical land of in the wild

4352
02:52:18,210 --> 02:52:20,240
[Music]

4353
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:22,479
again that assumes that uh one you can

4354
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:24,960
catch it again and it has been rewritten

4355
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:27,040
or modified to suit

4356
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,120
operational requirements of whoever is

4357
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:30,720
actually throwing it

4358
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:31,680
um

4359
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:33,760
but yeah like it's you can kind of see

4360
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:36,319
this introduces like a very complex

4361
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:38,560
process and like if you thought like vep

4362
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,240
in the public sector was difficult just

4363
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:42,720
imagine that for private sector it's a

4364
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:44,319
 nightmare that just hasn't

4365
02:52:44,319 --> 02:52:46,000
really been tackled yet

4366
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:46,310
um

4367
02:52:46,310 --> 02:52:47,600
[Music]

4368
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:49,920
but yeah i mean it's it's kind of

4369
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:52,160
up right um it means that you had

4370
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,319
knowledge of a vulnerability that you

4371
02:52:54,319 --> 02:52:56,160
knew could disrupt people's lives and

4372
02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:58,399
rather than patch it away you decided to

4373
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:00,319
leverage it to suit your own product

4374
02:53:00,319 --> 02:53:02,800
which is maybe a screwy thing to do

4375
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,760
um

4376
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,560
but

4377
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:06,319
again to kind of hedge that i think

4378
02:53:06,319 --> 02:53:08,720
cyber is maybe not as dangerous as we

4379
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:11,520
like to pretend it is um barring

4380
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,680
nightmares in the brains of people that

4381
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,600
work at dragos

4382
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:17,600
hopefully we're just not there yet but

4383
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:20,240
you know we'll see

4384
02:53:20,319 --> 02:53:22,720
but again this also tends to create a

4385
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:25,040
pay-to-play model that ends up leading

4386
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:26,720
or leaving some of the most vulnerable

4387
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,800
people out to dry and i think that's

4388
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:29,600
also

4389
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:31,920
kind of an unacceptable precedent to

4390
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:34,240
accept

4391
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:35,120
um

4392
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:36,319
so i mean

4393
02:53:36,319 --> 02:53:38,479
i hate to come up here and just all

4394
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:40,000
over an industry

4395
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,240
without offering any ideas on how we

4396
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:44,319
might be able to like

4397
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:47,040
solve the problem

4398
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,279
so

4399
02:53:51,359 --> 02:53:53,520
tasty like

4400
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:54,880
it really does look like i'm drinking

4401
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,720
his brains too it's wild

4402
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:58,560
um

4403
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,160
but i think we really need to critically

4404
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:02,160
re-evaluate the incentive structures

4405
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:04,399
that we can offer through intelligence

4406
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:06,240
companies in order to take steps to

4407
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:08,800
mitigate uh offensive cyber capabilities

4408
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:10,640
uh particularly abroad

4409
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:11,600
um

4410
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:15,120
so one option that uh

4411
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:17,680
my team at margin research recently uh

4412
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:20,399
kind of leaned into a little bit was we

4413
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:22,720
found and compiled a

4414
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:24,160
list of

4415
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:26,560
every private sector offensive threat

4416
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,080
capability

4417
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:30,080
ode shop

4418
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,399
developer in china

4419
02:54:32,399 --> 02:54:33,120
and

4420
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,359
then we published the list

4421
02:54:35,359 --> 02:54:37,120
it's on our blog you can see it it's

4422
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:38,800
great um

4423
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:40,560
and there's a couple reasons why i think

4424
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:42,000
this is actually

4425
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,680
kind of valuable and it might actually

4426
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:44,960
be able to move the ball forward a

4427
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:46,319
little bit um

4428
02:54:46,319 --> 02:54:49,120
as i'm sure all of us are aware uh very

4429
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,319
recently

4430
02:54:50,319 --> 02:54:53,840
um nso group got uh sanctioned out the

4431
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:54,640
ass

4432
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:55,840
um

4433
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:56,720
they

4434
02:54:56,720 --> 02:54:58,960
um i don't think the actual like

4435
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:00,800
development process really stopped i

4436
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:02,240
think they maybe plugged the computers

4437
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:03,680
and across the hall and then kind of

4438
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:05,920
kept going and like

4439
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,760
pet theories um

4440
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:10,000
but this set a very important precedent

4441
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:11,359
it meant that

4442
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:12,880
we were able to leverage one of the most

4443
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:15,520
powerful tools that you need that the

4444
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:17,279
united states has in its arsenal and

4445
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:19,359
that is we are the largest economy in

4446
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:20,479
the world

4447
02:55:20,479 --> 02:55:22,000
and if we say you're no longer allowed

4448
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,520
to deal with the largest economy in the

4449
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:26,399
world you're gonna eat immediately

4450
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:28,080
um

4451
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:30,479
now uh the thing i i didn't mention in

4452
02:55:30,479 --> 02:55:32,080
this list was what we did a bit

4453
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:33,520
differently because a lot of people knew

4454
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:35,760
about these groups already um

4455
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:38,080
there's this interesting uh competition

4456
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:40,560
in china called tianfoo cup and tianfoo

4457
02:55:40,560 --> 02:55:42,240
cup is basically

4458
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:44,880
oda competition in order to

4459
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:47,279
uh where you find something and then you

4460
02:55:47,279 --> 02:55:48,800
give it to the vendor and it's like okay

4461
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:50,080
fix it

4462
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:52,880
it's also a copy of pawn to own which is

4463
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:54,880
a american competition and it was

4464
02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:57,279
created because the chinese government

4465
02:55:57,279 --> 02:55:59,439
decided that

4466
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:01,359
you need to go through a prior

4467
02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:03,680
disclosure process with the government

4468
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:05,520
before you actually disclose any

4469
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:08,000
vulnerabilities now there's a lot of

4470
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,439
reasons why you could assume that might

4471
02:56:09,439 --> 02:56:10,560
happen

4472
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:13,439
alibaba recently got slapped hard on the

4473
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:15,840
wrist for not abiding by this process

4474
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:18,240
with the whole log for j fiasco

4475
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:19,120
um

4476
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:20,880
but this creates another interesting

4477
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:22,000
precedent

4478
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,279
uh which means that if you are

4479
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:26,479
building these capabilities and

4480
02:56:26,479 --> 02:56:28,080
demonstrating these capabilities on

4481
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:30,720
behalf of the chinese government uh you

4482
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:32,560
now have um

4483
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:35,439
a duty to report it ahead of time

4484
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:37,439
um so we can just assume they're

4485
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:39,200
skimming off the top i think it makes

4486
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:42,640
sense to if they're not doing it like

4487
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:44,479
do it i don't know like are you

4488
02:56:44,479 --> 02:56:46,160
stupid what like

4489
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:47,040
um

4490
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:48,880
it makes sense

4491
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:50,000
uh

4492
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,640
but as a result

4493
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:57,520
uh as a result um you can conclude that

4494
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:59,920
uh okay so these companies are actually

4495
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:02,800
building this sort of stuff

4496
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:04,160
okay so

4497
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:05,840
none of these companies like i said

4498
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:07,439
their private sector they don't really

4499
02:57:07,439 --> 02:57:09,200
want to just be like government

4500
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:11,600
contractors or oda developers they have

4501
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:12,880
a whole like

4502
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:14,640
private sector goal in mind they want to

4503
02:57:14,640 --> 02:57:16,640
be like blockchain companies all kinds

4504
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:18,560
of things like that

4505
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:20,560
they want to do like actual security in

4506
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:22,399
some capacity

4507
02:57:22,399 --> 02:57:23,520
and they all

4508
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:26,160
have private equity invested in them so

4509
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:28,560
what we did was we

4510
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:30,960
said which private equity was invested

4511
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:33,200
in them and then also said like oh by

4512
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,640
the way they're also they might get

4513
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:37,840
sanctioned soon i don't know like

4514
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:40,160
we all know it's very public because you

4515
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:42,000
kind of up and decided to clone a

4516
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:45,120
competition out of greed or whatever

4517
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:46,240
um

4518
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:47,840
and i i think it's gonna bite them in

4519
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:49,439
the ass hopefully

4520
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:50,960
um

4521
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:52,640
but that could

4522
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,800
very possibly work i don't know i mean

4523
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:56,399
i'm not holding my breath in any

4524
02:57:56,399 --> 02:57:58,319
capacity

4525
02:57:58,319 --> 02:57:59,600
but um

4526
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:02,560
yeah it's an interesting approach um but

4527
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:04,880
like as i mentioned earlier like

4528
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:06,560
you know there really are like perverse

4529
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,240
incentives that play that make uh

4530
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:10,080
disclosing findings really not a

4531
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:12,080
straightforward proposition

4532
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:13,680
and um

4533
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:15,359
that's assuming that you can even find

4534
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:16,720
any of these vulnerabilities in the

4535
02:58:16,720 --> 02:58:19,840
first place uh like i i came from the ad

4536
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:21,600
tech world and i think if people

4537
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:23,120
understood

4538
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:24,560
uh

4539
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:27,680
like how much ad tech data brokers can

4540
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:29,680
literally dox you they would probably

4541
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:32,000
like ron swanson their computer

4542
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,520
into a dumpster

4543
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:34,800
um

4544
02:58:34,800 --> 02:58:37,040
but uh there there might be another

4545
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,960
option here that we're not really

4546
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:41,920
necessarily acknowledging um and i'm

4547
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:44,080
kind of excited for the next slide it's

4548
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:45,600
my favorite i love it

4549
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:47,279
and it's

4550
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:50,000
you're gonna hate it

4551
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:52,560
all right so

4552
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:52,920
um

4553
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:55,840
[Music]

4554
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:58,080
this is this is a very interesting idea

4555
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:00,800
that i think has gotten a partially bad

4556
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:02,560
rap

4557
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:03,279
in

4558
02:59:03,279 --> 02:59:04,800
the very like policy oriented

4559
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:07,680
discussions around it um for those that

4560
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:09,040
aren't in the know

4561
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,279
cyber letters of mark

4562
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:12,479
are

4563
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,640
in the constitution it's old as it

4564
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:17,120
was originally a license that allowed

4565
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:21,600
people to be uh privateers like

4566
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:25,200
the actual letters of art

4567
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:26,640
if cyber letters and mark let people

4568
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:28,240
conduct piracy that'd be really

4569
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:31,039
cool but um

4570
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:33,920
hot takes that i'm not saying right now

4571
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:34,880
um

4572
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:36,240
hear me out all right i can't actually

4573
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:37,680
read with this thing but it's funny

4574
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:38,720
right

4575
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,720
thanks sophia

4576
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:42,479
um

4577
02:59:42,479 --> 02:59:43,920
but i mean like this the modern

4578
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:45,359
iteration of this gets called uh

4579
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:47,359
hackbacks pretty often right

4580
02:59:47,359 --> 02:59:49,439
uh in my mind i mean

4581
02:59:49,439 --> 02:59:51,359
haters are like yeah it's a bad idea to

4582
02:59:51,359 --> 02:59:52,399
hack back

4583
02:59:52,399 --> 02:59:54,080
um it's

4584
02:59:54,080 --> 02:59:55,279
hear me out

4585
02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:57,760
it's everything it's not hacking back if

4586
02:59:57,760 --> 02:59:59,200
you're hacking first

4587
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:01,439
that's it

4588
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:04,399
that it's that simple like um

4589
03:00:04,399 --> 03:00:06,880
the uh

4590
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:09,359
i i have to like call out people that

4591
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:10,960
get like kind of impulsively worked up

4592
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:12,319
over this um

4593
03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:14,720
it's like i said it gets a very bad rap

4594
03:00:14,720 --> 03:00:16,960
in terms of like the way it's described

4595
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:20,720
or defended um it would inherently like

4596
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:22,000
a lot of people think it would end up

4597
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,080
manifesting as like carte blanche like

4598
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:26,000
oh now you can hack anything you want

4599
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,720
with no repercussions that's obviously

4600
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:30,560
completely idiotic no one would ever

4601
03:00:30,560 --> 03:00:32,319
suggest that

4602
03:00:32,319 --> 03:00:34,960
any kind of implementation of this would

4603
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:36,720
require some sort of like governing

4604
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:38,560
authority you might not want that

4605
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:40,640
governing authority to be

4606
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:42,720
in line with the original

4607
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:44,000
like

4608
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,520
like the way this law is actually

4609
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:47,279
written which is that congress has to

4610
03:00:47,279 --> 03:00:49,359
authorize like give the authority to it

4611
03:00:49,359 --> 03:00:51,279
like we would not might not want the

4612
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:52,880
executive branch to be the one that gets

4613
03:00:52,880 --> 03:00:55,120
to say yes hack into that company and

4614
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:57,120
own the out of it please because i

4615
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:58,960
could it's a very slippery slope and it

4616
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:01,760
can go in like very bad directions um

4617
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:03,600
i like this idea because it kind of

4618
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:05,840
highlights a capability that we're not

4619
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,359
really leaning into

4620
03:01:07,359 --> 03:01:10,240
um i don't necessarily think that this

4621
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:11,840
is the

4622
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:13,920
fully featured like this document from

4623
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:15,920
the 18th century is the fully

4624
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:17,920
featured version of how we should

4625
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:20,080
conduct private sector cyber offensive

4626
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:20,960
action

4627
03:01:20,960 --> 03:01:23,279
but i think we should conduct private

4628
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:25,279
sector offensive action

4629
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:27,600
all right

4630
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:29,760
um

4631
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:31,359
so

4632
03:01:31,359 --> 03:01:32,720
you're right yeah like this needs a

4633
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:34,319
coordinating entity you need someone to

4634
03:01:34,319 --> 03:01:36,319
say like hey these guys are bastards go

4635
03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:38,479
hack like if you want to hack into them

4636
03:01:38,479 --> 03:01:39,600
and figure out like what you need to

4637
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,439
protect against

4638
03:01:41,439 --> 03:01:45,840
go hog wild so it's all you go for it um

4639
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:47,279
there's also a lot of like people

4640
03:01:47,279 --> 03:01:49,439
worried about retaliation

4641
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:51,680
um and this is really kind of the most

4642
03:01:51,680 --> 03:01:53,760
important part of this in my mind which

4643
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:54,720
is that

4644
03:01:54,720 --> 03:01:55,520
um

4645
03:01:55,520 --> 03:01:56,319
you're

4646
03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:57,760
what i'm talking about here is targeting

4647
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:00,240
groups that uh build oday for hostile

4648
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:02,720
regimes that commit

4649
03:02:02,720 --> 03:02:05,279
massive atrocities against

4650
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:09,359
humanity like globally um

4651
03:02:09,359 --> 03:02:10,399
you're

4652
03:02:10,399 --> 03:02:12,160
it

4653
03:02:12,160 --> 03:02:14,000
it's sort of a foregone conclusion right

4654
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,479
like you're already a target i'm not

4655
03:02:16,479 --> 03:02:19,120
talking about escalatory behavior i'm

4656
03:02:19,120 --> 03:02:20,640
only talking about leveling a playing

4657
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,960
field people abroad like these

4658
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:24,640


4659
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,560
don't have these misgivings about

4660
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:28,640
hacking into all of you

4661
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:30,399
um the crowd strikes out there the

4662
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:32,640
mandiants the googles like

4663
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:34,560
they're not going to think twice and say

4664
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:36,319
like oh wait are they building offensive

4665
03:02:36,319 --> 03:02:37,600
capabilities that i need to be worried

4666
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:39,760
about or maybe there's like a private

4667
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:41,359
sector oda company

4668
03:02:41,359 --> 03:02:43,040
in the west um

4669
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:45,760
like they're target number one if

4670
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:47,600
they're paying any attention

4671
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:49,279
um

4672
03:02:49,279 --> 03:02:51,680
they're not going to think twice it's

4673
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:54,800
it's it's really putting us on at least

4674
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:56,319
equal footing

4675
03:02:56,319 --> 03:02:58,399
um but really like what i'm kind of

4676
03:02:58,399 --> 03:03:00,080
trying to get at here is i want to be

4677
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:01,840
able to empower the groups that we're

4678
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:04,160
relying on in order to mitigate some of

4679
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:06,800
these uh really nasty capabilities that

4680
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:07,920
are happening

4681
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,439
um they're

4682
03:03:09,439 --> 03:03:12,000
currently doing some really arcane

4683
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:15,359
with what they've got access to

4684
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:17,120
and i think this would help push them

4685
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:19,359
over the edge in a way that could

4686
03:03:19,359 --> 03:03:22,800
possibly be controlled and directed

4687
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,399
by people who have decent targeting

4688
03:03:24,399 --> 03:03:26,640
capability and can affect proper

4689
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:27,920
attribution

4690
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:31,279
and in my mind this is how we're able to

4691
03:03:31,279 --> 03:03:33,359
kind of move the ball forward

4692
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:36,399
stop being reactive and start

4693
03:03:36,399 --> 03:03:39,760
applying a proactive approach to solving

4694
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:41,520
uh the security problem that we all kind

4695
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:42,640
of deal with

4696
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:43,680
so

4697
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:47,120
that's it that's what i got

4698
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:51,760
thank you

4699

part of me doesn't want to take

4700
03:03:53,200 --> 03:03:54,319
questions because i don't want to get

4701
03:03:54,319 --> 03:03:56,479
