63
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
and we would like for kovit to go away

64
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,560

65
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,639
extraordinarily contagious and terrible

66
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,199

70
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
the year of covid has had some

71
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
operational impacts on us including not

72
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
getting our act together on grants for

73
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
the third year which we're very sorry

74
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
about but next year

75
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
we'll be back to issuing grants and we

76
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
will also begin using

77
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,279
the cfp process for speakers so

78
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
if you have ideas if there are things

79
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,279
that you would like to uh to present or

80
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
if you just happen to have a machine

81
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,479
learning algorithm for producing

82
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,279
cfp abstracts

83
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,040
we're looking forward to uh what it is

84
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,199
that you give to us

85
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
uh we are streaming on on youtube

86
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
um the link for that just went out over

87
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,600
twitter a couple of minutes ago

88
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
so uh hi to everybody who is uh joining

89
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
us from uh the internet um hiram or uh

90
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
and his crew are figuring out how to

91
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
make all this work

92
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,279
um

93
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,199
definitely not as cool as being here in

94
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,920
person live with uh this august and

95
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
noisy

96
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
group of people

97
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
um

98
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
the the live stream also is subject to

99
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
youtube just like crashing it at any

100
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
time because they decide that like music

101
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,959
that we're using isn't cleared or

102
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,320
whatever they have done that to us in

103
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
the past we will do our best to avoid

104
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
that problem this year

105
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,880
but thank you for rolling with the

106
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,959
punches with us

107
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
all right

108
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
it is important that i mention

109
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,920
that we have a code of conduct

110
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
and um i am i would be remiss if i did

111
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,240
not tell you

112
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,079
that we do not tolerate harassment of

113
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,720
conference participants in any form

114
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,399
um if you

115
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
violate our very simple code of conduct

116
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,440
we will remove you

117
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
we will remove you without a refund we

118
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320

there is a conduct-related issue that

124
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
you would like for the the conference

125
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120

about any conduct issues um if you do

132
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
not feel comfortable talking to a member

call

136
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,199
our

137
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,519
conduct hotline

138
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
720

139
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,519
586 hack

140
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
and speak with a

141
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,040
a

142
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
member of our team who will attempt to

143
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
address your concern right away

144
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,079
all right

145
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,120
now

146
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
perfect timing john

147
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,920
john is here

148
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,439
it wouldn't be an intervention

149
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,799
yes exactly all right

150
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,520
why do we talk about the money john uh

151
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,400
because we want to present transparency

152
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,839
and because we think everybody else

153
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
should do it and no one does yeah

154
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,119
everybody should be doing this why don't

155
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
more conferences start out with people

156
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,880
talking about the money i would say that

157
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
we we have to talk about the money in

158
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
embarrassing ways

159
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
because we did not bring in a lot of

160
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,679
money this year

161
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
we we did drop the ball a little bit

162
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
between my midlife crisis and you

163
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
traveling yeah

164
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,080

i kind of was concerned actually uh i

172
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,520
really didn't think we'd have enough

speakers to to fill the alignment 48

174

all right anyway so um we we do uh if

177
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
you if you like hearing about um

178
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,080
transparent uh finances for conferences

179
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
demand that other conferences do it too

180
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,080
we say this every year you know ask

181
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,480
people to write on the on the on the on

182
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
the side of the box what you're what

183
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
you're paying for and what what what

184
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,320
they're spending

185
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,679
uh

186
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
or don't i'm not your mother

187
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
anyway uh okay so just very we are

188
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
always looking for more sponsors just in

189
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
case you have to have an employer that

190
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,679
feels generous or wants to support the

191
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,960
cost

192
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
or just you know like to give us money

193
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
yeah you know just full of sweaty money

194
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
we'll take it any way you want i you

195
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
know i'm i'm not proud all right so um

196
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
income is how much comes in

197
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
expenses how much goes out um our our

198
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,360
profit and loss is um you know revenue

199
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
minus expenses is profit or or

200
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
loss if if revenue is higher than

201
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
that or lower than our expenses and the

202
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
endowment

203
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,559
which just to be clear a couple years

204
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,919
ago we

205
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
did a great job in raising a lot of

206
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,440
extra money because we knew we were

207
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
going to have

208
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,280
uh some kind of new financial crisis we

209
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
didn't realize it would be a pandemic

210
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
multi-year global pandemic who had that

211
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,400
on their bingo card i mean it was close

212
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
so it's like there's going to be an

213
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
event yeah um

214
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
but we were able to raise some extra

215
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,080
money to smooth out when we have some

216
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
down years this is a down year

217
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
fortunately

218
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
these

219
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
normally aren't things that persist

220
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
more than two or three years

221
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
so we're hoping by next year we should

222
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,679
be able to get back back in the block or

223
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
we will have everybody will be here with

224
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
machetes and uh you know they'll be

225
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,919
wearing their you know their leather you

226
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,400
know and the mad max stuff sure yeah

227
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
sure it's gonna look a lot less like

228
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
this yeah this may not be that yeah

229
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
anyway it's gonna go one of two ways is

230
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,760
what i'm saying

231
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
let's see how those november elections

232
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,760
go all right so the endowment is

233
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,080
basically any money that we don't spend

234
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
gets parked there for us to use in the

235
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,039
future

236
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,600
which also has not been invested

237
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
uh we'll probably start to invest it

238
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
later on this year

239
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,080
we did that and i should say i did that

240
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,559
because we were being very conservative

241
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,480
being concerned on

242
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
the what happens next we know there's

243
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,600
this kind of looming uncertainty and

244
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,640
that was a thing so yes yeah so you can

245
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
see that sponsorship revenues have been

246
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,159
low

247
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
uh in part because there is an ongoing

248
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,159
global pandemic in 2020 we we raised

249
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
zero sponsorship dollars we also um

250
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,480
um

251
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
crucially uh ran that event entirely

252
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,559
virtually so like it was a very

253
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,559
inexpensive year for us overall

254
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,520
but

255
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,080
yeah this year our our income between

256
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,520
attendees

257
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
thank you for paying for your tickets

258
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,320
everyone

259
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
and sponsorship was a little more than

260
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,280
32 grand

261
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,400
we spent the lion's share on this on the

262
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,679
various fees people like um our

263
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,200
our video village over there that are

264
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,440
that are broadcasting the event

265
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,320
production team um the people who are

266
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
responsible for uh some of the the the

267
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
uh

268
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,320
the tech that makes the thing operate

269
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,280
that was the the largest piece of our of

270
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,880
our spend uh after that it's t-shirts

271
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
it's incredibly expensive yeah sure for

272
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,960
some reason i don't know like who knew

273
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,640
that inflation was going to hit

274
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
t-shirts incredible yeah but there you

275
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
have it make sure you get your t-shirts

276
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,559
and just just to be clear mark and i

277
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,520
have never received a dime so

278
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
that's just not a thing we don't get

279
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
paid yeah we have the goodness of our

280
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
heart and

281
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
uh we seem to enjoy it i just like

282
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
having an excuse to wear this jacket

283
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,039
frankly and it's a wonderful job

284
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,000
[Applause]

285
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
so anyway breakdown of expenses over the

286
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
past few years you know you can

287
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
pause this on the youtube or whatever

288
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,000
and like you know and analyze it

289
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
carefully get your forensic accounting

290
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,480
going

291
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,919
all right uh this year we are um on a

292
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
razor's edge between

293
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,919
um how much we brought in and how much

294
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
we spent we are um

295
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,360
we are losing 150 this year

296
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
that could be so much worse it really

297
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
could be yes

298
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
yeah yeah and you can see that like you

299
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
know we

300
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,799
just getting through the past few years

301
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
has been kind of an astounding thing so

302
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
um

303
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
cool uh maybe maybe buy john a cocktail

304
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,799
uh to help make up for that that 150

305
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,080
that he's not going to be able to afford

306
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,360
at the bar you're going to definitely be

307
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
able to afford 150 at that point i think

308
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,679
he'll be fine yeah okay

309
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
so here we go

310
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,960
all right

311
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,159
uh and our endowment

312
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,280
to uh prophecy has grown because we had

313
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
about 11 000 go into it from last year

314
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
um

315
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
as john said we will we will begin more

316
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
aggressively investing this money

317
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,240
between this and our our grants process

318
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,520
and then just having a cushion for

319
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
the next global pandemic

320
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
people thought monkey pox was funny

321
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
because there's a funny sounding name

322
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,520
but it's not that funny so

323
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,360
don't don't get monkey pucks in anyone i

324
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
mean you you kind of have to

325
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,440
intentionally do something to get it

326
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
so

327
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,799
i'll see in the green room

328
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,440
it's not airborne yet all right so okay

329
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,039
so um

330
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
we are a 501c3

331
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,720
uh that basically means that um we

332
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,400
put the money that we don't spend into

333
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,279
our endowment uh and also uh as an

334
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,720
important note

335
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
these numbers

336
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
are as good as they can be right now

337
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,919
um i do know that we just issued a

338
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
refund to someone who tested positive

339
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
for covid so whoever you are out there

340
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
who said i can't come because i have

341
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,080
coveted you did the right thing thank

342
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400

yeah so like you know these numbers

346
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,360
could move around a little bit but we

347
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
feel pretty good about this also like a

348
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,720
sponsor could just be like yeah we'll

349
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
you know pay you and they never do yeah

350
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
that's that's never happened though

351
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
because our sponsors are the greatest

352
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,679
all right hang on i gotta just make sure

353
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,159
we're on on schedule here okay we are

354
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,640
how about that okay uh all right so

355
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
speaking of money

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,600
um

357
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,679
it does take money to make this happen

358
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
and i always say the companies who

359
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
sponsor summercon the goods and services

360
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,640
of those companies are remarkably better

361
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
than the goods and services companies

362
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,880
that do not sponsor summercon

363
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,679

engage with them right now because they

370
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240

371
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
faceless and we we hope that they will

372

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
the time we talked about hazards we

512
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
talked about reducing risk we talked

513
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,559
about

514
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,799
saving lives basically because in

515
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,240
engineering

516
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,039
when you make a mistake when you make a

517
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,760
when you design something badly

518
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,799
and

519
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,960
when disaster happens

520
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,039
people can die

521
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,440
and

522
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,159
thankfully in cyber security for the

523
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
most part we don't have to deal with

524
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
that risk though there are certain

525
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,159
situations like you know the medical

526
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,720
field uh critical infrastructure and so

527
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
on where lives are indeed at risk in

528
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
cyber security uh

529
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
there are still nonetheless a lot of

530
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,360
parallels between the two because uh

531
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,159
as defenders i'm i'm a defender uh for

532
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,919
anyone else who's a defender we deal

533
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,240
with risk we deal with managing risks

534
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,720
and as a result of that

535
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
we try to do that as best we can and in

536
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,720
cyber security this field is pretty new

537
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
it's not that developed so uh

538
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
so maybe we can take some lessons from

539
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
uh

540
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,399
from traditional engineering you know

541
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,480
mechanical chemical industrial who've

542
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
been dealing with these kinds of risks

543
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
and hazards for

544
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,519
far far longer than we have

545
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,279
before we get going

546
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,640
i just wanted to give a content warning

547
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
we are going to be talking about you

548
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
know engineering disasters engineering

549
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,679
failures

550
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,919
uh in some cases people have been

551
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,240
injured in some cases people have died

552
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,360
these are

553
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,080
real events that have actually happened

554
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
so you know if you need to step out or

555
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
you want to skip the talk i completely

556
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,919
understand uh

557
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,159
no problem here uh take care of yourself

558
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
and yeah i won't be showing anything

559
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,000
graphic though but again i will be

560
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
talking about situations in which

561
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
people have died

562
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,080
so with without any further ado let me

563
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,720
start with a classic example i'm sure

564
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,799
all of you have heard of this

565
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,559
the october 21st 2016 accident at the

566
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,279
mgpi processing facility in atchison

567
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,320
kansas

568
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,039
no

569
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
no no one heard of this uh actually i'm

570
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,919
willing to bet that at least one or two

571
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,720
of you have heard of this because uh

572
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,279
these accidents are investigated by the

573
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,000
u.s chemical safety board who is this

574
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,559
government body that has a youtube

575
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,640
channel and like they post about these

576
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,399
kinds of disasters all the time on their

577
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,120
channel so uh shameless plug if you want

578
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,960
to hear more about these kinds of things

579
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,159
uh

580
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,760
check out their youtube channel

581
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,799
so basically this is some uh

582
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,960
processing chemical processing facility

583
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,519
it's not actually processing mgpi mgpi

584
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
is the brand name and they're here in

585
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
kansas and they do all sorts of like

586
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,919
stuff with like really gnarly chemicals

587
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,559
uh you have like a lot of you know big

588
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,240
massive facilities but the thing that's

589
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
relevant right here whoop i i seem to be

590
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,360
tethered to this area is that mod b

591
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,600
building over there

592
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
oh thank you so much thanks for feeding

593
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
me additional line on my leash uh so the

594
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,600
mod b building over there uh that tiny

595
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,679
facility is the one that we're going to

596
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
be talking about uh this is what it

597
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,039
looks like

598
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,080
and

599
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,399
this deals with actually makes food

600
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,559
related stuff you know spirits wheat

601
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,080
protein sort of like all sorts of like

602
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
wheat and

603
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,799
wheat adjacent uh food

604
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,919
stuffs

605
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,519
uh if you're not familiar with these

606
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,200
kinds of facilities you'd think that you

607
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
know they're processing something that

608
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,559
ends up being food you'd think that you

609
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,919
know it's not that bad it's not that

610
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,719
gnarly but no they're using like really

611
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,040
nasty gnarly chemicals

612
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
uh and in fact if we take a look at the

613
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,480
floor plan which is like really crappily

614
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
you'll see that over there is that

615
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
loading area that i showed earlier and

616
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
you got two big massive chemical tanks

617
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,879
one of them has sodium hypochlorite or

618
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,199
also known as bleach and the other one

619
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,839
has sulfuric acid now they always tell

620
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,399
you not to mix ammonia in bleach but

621
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,239
actually if you mix sulfuric acid and

622
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,000
bleach it's just as bad what happens is

623
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,359
uh you get basically uh chlorine gas

624
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,280
like like massive massive waves of

625
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
chlorine gas that's you know really

626
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,639
[ __ ] toxic

627
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,399
uh and obviously they have these you

628
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,480
know you get a truck over there truck

629
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,800
comes in uh loads up the chemicals the

630
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
chemicals get uh fed into a processing

631
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,359
area where they like do whatever

632
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,200
chemical reactions they need to do

633
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,560
and after that that's that's about it uh

634
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,440
that that's that's kind of the process

635
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,040
so uh

636
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
at the at the day on the day of the

637
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
event

638
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,640
what happened was

639
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
that

640
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
the the loading truck came in

641
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
and was supposed to load uh this big

642
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,599
tank of like this this you know like

643
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,440
truck sized uh amount of sulfuric acid

644
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,520
and you got the sulfuric acid a

645
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
container you got the the bleach

646
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,800
container uh and you know the guy was

647
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,000
supposed to uh come in load up the

648
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
correct fill line over here to put it in

649
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
the sulfuric acid tank and uh

650
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
and and yeah so basically you know you

651
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
got you got a whole bunch of loading

652
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
lines that's the sulfuric acid over

653
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,040
there this one's the bleach and uh you

654
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,599
know the guy who oversaw the facility

655
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
and oversaw the loading process came to

656
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,760
the truck driver

657
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,640
uh he told him okay that's that right

658
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,880
over there is the sulfuric acid line uh

659
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
loaded up over there uh i'm gonna head

660
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
out now you make sure you know you're on

661
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,079
the connections you turn on the pumps

662
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,119
and so on

663
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,400
so uh

664
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,119
so yeah the dude had to load acid in the

665
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,800
correct pipe

666
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,079
uh and

667
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,520
he well if he [ __ ] up he poured acid

668
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
into the bleach container uh and like

669
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,040
lots and lots of like uh chlorine would

670
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
would get out so uh

671
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,359
before i talk about what happened i'm

672
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,280
gonna ask a question it's a rhetorical

673
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,320
question have you ever almost [ __ ] up

674
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
you know like

675
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
almost type the wrong command in the

676
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
command line and like

677
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
wipe the database or something just

678
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
almost like like almost press enter like

679
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,560
oh [ __ ] i shouldn't have done that

680
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,079
oh no

681
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,079
you know maybe you

682
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
almost pushed the credential to

683
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
to to a public repository

684
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
maybe you actually did that and you

685
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
caught yourself right

686
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,079
right after you know maybe you committed

687
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,920
it but you you realized it before you

688
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
pushed or you forgot to push you know

689
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,680
you just got super lucky

690
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,800
you know i'm sure a lot of us here have

691
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
that story

692
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,680
now remember

693
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,839
how you felt

694
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
when you when that happened when you

695
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
almost did that

696
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,839
when you almost [ __ ] up

697
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,119
like

698
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,560
did it scare you

699
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
did you feel that like sinking feeling

700
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
in your heart

701
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,000
maybe

702
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,599
you kind of sat there and disbelief is

703
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,560
like

704
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
that was close

705
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,880
maybe it jolted you awake maybe you know

706
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,560
it was like 2 a.m you needed to get this

707
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,359
done

708
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,880
and uh

709
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
you're like okay

710
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
i promise i'm going to pay attention now

711
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
i almost [ __ ] up but it's fine i

712
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
caught myself i'm going to pay attention

713
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
in the future

714
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,200
and uh and and yeah i'm just going to be

715
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
super careful from now on

716
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
now how many of you instead of doing

717
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,720
that actually stopped everything that

718
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,839
you were doing and changed the process

719
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
changed the way you work

720
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,839
added guard

721
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,960
rails uh

722
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,160
in uh

723
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,400
to prevent you from making that kind of

724
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,760
mistake

725
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
uh

726
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
or how many of you were like i'm just

727
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,839
gonna pay attention and uh

728
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,119
and and i won't [ __ ] up i promise uh

729
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,960
i cannot [ __ ] up if i if i just pay

730
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
attention you know i'll never have an

731
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
attention lapse

732
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,480
anyway i've uh i've built that up long

733
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,359
enough

734
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,400
all right so uh i am the overseer of the

735
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,560
facility um you are the truck driver

736
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,960
i told you which one is the sulfuric

737
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
acid

738
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,160
do you remember do you remember which

739
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
one of them it is

740
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
are you sure are you 100 sure are you

741
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,640
willing to stake lives on that

742
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
uh well

743
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,680
in this particular instance

744
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
uh the

745
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
the truck driver

746
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,640
loaded up the sulfuric acid over here

747
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
which was the bleach line uh the

748
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,119
yeah the bleach line

749
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
and this is what happened

750
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,640
massive

751
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,119
massive release of chlorine gas

752
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,320
uh

753
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,280
this was humongous uh

754
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
around a hundred over a hundred people

755
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,359
needed medical attention some were

756
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,200
hospitalized

757
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,960
over ten thousand people had to evacuate

758
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,839
or shelter in place

759
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,520
through sheer luck

760
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,560
you know nobody died everyone was fine

761
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
uh there were not really any long-term

762
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,079
injuries and so on

763
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,160
but oh boy

764
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,920
and you know

765
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
like you're all familiar with

766
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
postmortems right

767
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
you probably have like a thousand and

768
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,640
one questions and objections you're

769
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
screaming at the screen like like you're

770
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
over there is like why the [ __ ] didn't

771
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,359
the guy like tell the

772
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,359
stay there to tell him okay that's no no

773
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,800
you're loading the wrong one load that

774
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
one load that one why didn't why didn't

775
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,160
he do that

776
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,839
why were the why were the lines

777
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,680
compatible like in what world would you

778
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,079
want to load sulfuric acid into a bleach

779
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,200
tank never like why could he physically

780
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,240
connect the two together now i actually

781
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,480
have an answer for the first one i mean

782
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
the second one is just poor design and

783
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,119
like like poor safety but the first one

784
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,280
is actually really interesting like why

785
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
did the guy who knew which line was

786
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,440
which

787
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,079
why didn't he stay there to make sure

788
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,920
that the ones were connected properly

789
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,200
well it turns out that the truck driver

790
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
has personal protective equipment has

791
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,359
like a nice like like like mask and

792
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,480
everything and he figured that it would

793
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,960
be safer if he wasn't there because he

794
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
didn't have safety equipment and let the

795
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,880
guy with the safety equipment handle the

796
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,920
dangerous task

797
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
so it was done

798
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,079
like the procedure

799
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,720
said you have to watch him like load the

800
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,480
uh like like connect the things you have

801
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,720
to physically watch him and he deviated

802
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,599
from that procedure because he thought

803
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,119
it was gonna be safer now and how many

804
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,720
situations

805
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,680
have you done a post-mortem and one of

806
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,599
the root causes

807
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,200
was that the people who were involved

808
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,760
did not properly understand the risks

809
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,079
and hazards

810
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,880
think about it as security people we

811
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,720
kind of have this understanding this

812
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,760
knowledge

813
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,119
of

814
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,760
you know what the risks are what happens

815
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,359
if you do this what happens if you do

816
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,160
that but like oftentimes at least

817
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
what i i'm just gonna talk for myself

818
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,160
i'm not gonna talk for anyone else but a

819
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,480
lot of times i see security people tell

820
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,359
okay you need to do things this way

821
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,560
but they never explain why

822
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,440
what the risk isn't doing that way and

823
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,920
and and what are the problems if you

824
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,000
deviate what actually happens like how

825
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,800
many engineers actually understand

826
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,040
how like escalation works and and why

827
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,480
you can't just like oh this thing

828
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,640
doesn't access personal information yeah

829
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,079
but it could

830
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,760
but like that

831
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,160
mentality that that way of like figuring

832
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,560
out ways then which things can go wrong

833
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
is not necessarily ingrained

834
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
in you know it's it's our job like

835
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,119
that's what we do we we train for that

836
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,920
like the average engineer isn't gonna

837
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
know that unless the they're taught

838
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,520
they're told unless you know they're

839
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,240
trained in that

840
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,200
so uh i'm gonna tell you a story about

841
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,440
something that happened uh at one of my

842
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,920
companies

843
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,720
in terms of security

844
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
and uh

845
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,119
we had an engineer who had an emacs

846
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,359
configuration file

847
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,400
and

848
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,119
he had to he had it on his computer and

849
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,520
he wanted to sync it with his with his

850
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,720
dev box

851
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,560
uh unfortunately the kind of

852
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,359
synchronization process was a bit janky

853
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,520
and like it was kind of annoying so what

854
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,079
he did was he put the imax configuration

855
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,240
file on github on a public repository

856
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,319
you know it's fine it's public no one no

857
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,240
one cares it's just some configs and so

858
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,760
on and then he would download that

859
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,440
config file to his dev box and one day

860
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,800
he was uh

861
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,440
troubleshooting uh something completely

862
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,480
unrelated and he had taken a machine

863
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,160
credential to do that

864
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,760
he didn't have access to the thing to

865
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
troubleshoot it and like he was going to

866
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,240
talk to the infrastructure team but like

867
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,079
to get the access but like they weren't

868
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,760
very responsive so it was like i have

869
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,880
this this machine credential that i can

870
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,000
like join and like use it for debugging

871
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,720
for troubleshooting so i'm gonna do that

872
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,520
and he did that and as part of that he

873
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,319
had to load that credential into his max

874
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,839
config file

875
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,359
and

876
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,480
he forgot about it and he pushed it and

877
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,040
we got an aws credential

878
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,000
with

879
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,359
wide access to swaths of pii

880
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
uh up on the uh

881
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,240
up on the internet now thankfully aws

882
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,079
does have crawlers and they lock that

883
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,480
stuff down immediately if they see a

884
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,720
published credential to github and we

885
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,280
ran the uh

886
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
and we ran the

887
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,560
root cause analysis and we you know we

888
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,839
checked the logs and everything like

889
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,000
that and uh you know nothing bad

890
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
happened but oh boy that was uh that was

891
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,760
close you know

892
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,720
and

893
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,960
uh the point here

894
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
is not that oh the guy [ __ ] up it was

895
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,319
inevitable it was bound to happen

896
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,560
the process processes the way in which

897
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,920
people work the way in which the

898
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,880
organization was set up made it

899
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,480
inevitable for someone to mess up

900
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,760
eventually

901
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
like it's not the guy's fault uh

902
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,599
it was gonna happen like

903
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,280
it was gonna happen

904
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
and you know a good root cause analysis

905
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,680
will suss that out it'll say okay the

906
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,920
processes were bad like the machine

907
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,520
credential had too much access or

908
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,480
whatever like uh the troubleshooting

909
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,400
steps were not were not good the

910
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,920
engineers didn't have proper access when

911
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,160
they needed it and so on and so forth

912
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,800
like a goods you know post-mortem like

913
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,280
i've seen like a lot of them they all

914
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
come to the same conclusions they all

915
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,839
give great recommendations those

916
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,359
recommendations hopefully get

917
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,040
implemented uh

918
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,760
it

919
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,599
doesn't always happen in my experience

920
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,800
but you know

921
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,640
uh but all of this stuff is after the

922
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,839
fact like something happened and then

923
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,520
you run a root cause analysis like is

924
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
there a way to get kind of get in front

925
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,400
of that

926
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,720
and uh and and that leads me to my next

927
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,000
question how do you actually control

928
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,720
risk how do you control risk before it

929
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,119
happens and i've seen

930
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,640
a lot of approaches in security on this

931
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,599
uh you know i've seen people talk about

932
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,880
human factors like a lot of my friends

933
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,720
talk about human products i'm a big

934
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,280
proponent of human factors analysis in

935
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,400
uh

936
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
in in engineering and in in determining

937
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,400
risk but some people say you need

938
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
alerting and visibility uh if something

939
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,760
bad happens you need to know about it

940
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,119
now you need to have like automated

941
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,119
guard rails shut it down uh to prevent

942
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,800
something bad from happening you know

943
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,400
you need to move security to the left

944
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,760
like all of you have heard this move

945
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,680
security to the left like like bring it

946
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,760
earlier in the life cycle and so on make

947
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,000
inherently safer processes and so on but

948
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
i've heard about all these philosophies

949
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,560
but

950
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,000
there's not really any unified

951
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,560
philosophy right uh you know we got

952
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,119
standards we got the oauth top 10 to to

953
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,359
see like what we want to take a look at

954
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,359
we we have like sans recommendations we

955
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,160
have nist standards and so on but we

956
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
don't really have like anything like

957
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,599
super uh

958
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,040
super standardized right like if you

959
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,160
think about like if you search for a

960
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
risk reduction model in cyber security

961
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
you're going to find like 10 google

962
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,240
search results and probably eight

963
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,839
different methods in the just on the

964
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,960
first page

965
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,280
so uh you know and and just food for

966
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,040
thought like if we're talking about an

967
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,200
industry that's growing so fast and

968
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,160
that's that's so big and

969
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,079
that that starts to carry with it more

970
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,440
and more risk

971
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,720
like it would be nice to have some

972
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,319
regulation right like the chemical

973
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,560
industry is highly regulated

974
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,920
uh

975
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
why not us like why not have those

976
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,920
regulations because there's a lot of

977
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,760
similarities there's a lot of parallels

978
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,720
between

979
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,599
cyber security and and risk in terms of

980
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,440
you know traditional engineering just

981
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,839
some food for thought over there so

982
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,200
let's see

983
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,439
how

984
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,240
how they did it how the united states

985
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,640
chemical safety board what are their

986
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,319
recommendations how did they conduct

987
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,559
this this root cause analysis

988
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,359
and i'm gonna pull out a paragraph and

989
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,359
i'm just gonna read off of the slide

990
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,640
like a great presenter

991
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
when the risk associated with hazardous

992
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,480
chemicals cannot be eliminated through

993
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,800
substitution or other inherently safer

994
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,200
approaches the next best approach is to

995
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,720
design a system that meets the

996
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,400
limitations of human and machine

997
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,480
interactions and provides additional

998
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,520
layers of protection like that's like

999
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,839
really like sort of like government

1000
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,400
speak for like oh you know reduce the

1001
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,559
risks add guard rails right

1002
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,880
like uh like it's like this this highly

1003
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,480
sophisticated government speak about

1004
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
like oh substitution inherently safer

1005
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
approaches but no actually they're

1006
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,960
talking about something really really

1007
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,119
specific they're talking about a very

1008
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
specific framework that they're using

1009
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,680
that they're using all over the place in

1010
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,520
industry and that is called the

1011
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,160
hierarchy of controls this is what they

1012
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,640
point to all the time this is what i use

1013
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,079
i've implemented in security this is

1014
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,640
what they point to all the time whenever

1015
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,160
an industrial accident happened whenever

1016
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,040
a chemical accident happened

1017
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,319
this has this diagram is is just copy

1018
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,400
pasted from the website of the national

1019
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,599
institute of occupational and safety

1020
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,480
hazards which is part of the cdc this

1021
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,599
thing is is like a government uh

1022
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,319
model that they've sort of implemented

1023
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,640
and enforced and sort of regulated

1024
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,559
across the industry so let's talk a

1025
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,559
little bit about what we're looking at

1026
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,839
right here this is these are various

1027
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,559
types of controls that you can implement

1028
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,440
in order to control for hazards

1029
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,520
so let's talk a little bit about it uh

1030
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,000
personal protective equipment this is

1031
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,960
protecting the worker with ppe now in

1032
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,040
that particular case the the truck

1033
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,640
driver who loaded up the uh

1034
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,680
the the the the sulfuric acid into the

1035
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,079
bleach line actually had ppe but

1036
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,400
unfortunately the ppe was not enough so

1037
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,040
he actually succumbed to the chlorine

1038
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,119
gas as well now if he had proper ppe the

1039
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
accident would still have happened but

1040
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,800
he would have been able to reach the

1041
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,680
emergency shutoff valve and turn off the

1042
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,400
flow of chemicals but because he didn't

1043
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,480
have the proper ppe

1044
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,720
he was unable to do that

1045
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,559
now let's talk about administrative

1046
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,760
controls right like like uh changing the

1047
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,079
way people work this is slightly more

1048
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,680
effective but you can see that still in

1049
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,440
kind of the red zone not very effective

1050
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,040
there were some administrative controls

1051
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
in place here uh one of them said uh you

1052
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,319
gotta watch the guy load up the

1053
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,000
fill lines and make sure that the

1054
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,920
correct fill line is uh

1055
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,040
is loaded up and there's other controls

1056
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
that say like hey you need to actually

1057
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,640
verify that these controls are working

1058
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,400
you know if anyone's ever done sock 2

1059
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,240
there's a lot of that going on like

1060
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,160
making sure your controls are working in

1061
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,599
this particular case the administrative

1062
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,599
controls didn't work as because the

1063
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,280
process wasn't followed they thought it

1064
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,559
was safer but uh actually was worse

1065
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,480
uh now we move on to more effective

1066
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,240
controls and engineering controls is

1067
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,079
like kind of a big one right like these

1068
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,599
are the guardrails that we keep talking

1069
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,599
about these are the you know the safety

1070
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,680
measures like like a mechanism to

1071
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,280
prevent you from committing a credential

1072
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,800
to code like something that checks

1073
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,559
before you commit and so on you know

1074
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,760
that's the sort of stuff that's an

1075
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,960
engineering control and

1076
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,200
and specifically this engineering

1077
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,880
control would be

1078
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,680
make the lines incompatible like make it

1079
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,520
physically impossible like make them

1080
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,960
keto or something make it physically

1081
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,839
impossible for the for the lines to

1082
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,680
physically connect to each other

1083
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,280
now we're talking about now we're

1084
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
getting into fantasyland right like

1085
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,839
substitution uh you know use different

1086
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,280
chemicals like maybe you can use

1087
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
something else instead of bleach that

1088
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,319
you know is still gnarly maybe you can

1089
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,359
use like

1090
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,559
uh

1091
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,119
i don't know like a

1092
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,079
lie or something and uh you know it's

1093
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,079
still a gnarly chemical but it doesn't

1094
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,040
uh

1095
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,839
react with sulfuric acid that badly

1096
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,400
and uh and and over there at the top is

1097
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,640
illumination like these people are

1098
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,640
making these kinds of you know these

1099
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,480
these chemicals these foodstuffs can can

1100
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,200
they

1101
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,920
use an inherently safer process

1102
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
and you know these kind these things are

1103
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,280
not realistic like the plants already

1104
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,800
built they're not going to change the

1105
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,599
whole goddamn process even if

1106
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,119
such a process even exists

1107
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,880
so let's talk a little bit about how it

1108
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,640
would look like in a security event and

1109
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,920
i'm going to use that same example with

1110
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,440
a leak credential

1111
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,319
uh

1112
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,319
you know ppe

1113
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,680
we had ppe it's basically like automated

1114
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,440
response and other preventive tooling

1115
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,720
aws

1116
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,160
shut off that credential as soon as it

1117
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,760
went on github like within minutes and

1118
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,480
we got an alert that was the last line

1119
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,400
of defense and it worked

1120
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,720
it worked because of that

1121
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,599
we didn't get any pii exposed

1122
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,280
you know uh you can talk about

1123
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,040
administrative controls like have a

1124
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,680
different synchronization mechanism

1125
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,119
put in a process to check for

1126
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,359
credentials and so on like like there's

1127
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,520
lots of things you can do to

1128
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,680
make it so that the person works

1129
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,880
differently

1130
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,319
so that it makes it a bit safer

1131
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,520
to

1132
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,079
to do these processes like when we can

1133
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,680
talk about engineering controls engine

1134
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,319
controls are like like that credential

1135
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,800
was needed to do some troubleshooting

1136
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,160
like could that troubleshooting have

1137
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
been done automatically could have that

1138
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,640
credential being loaded up on a machine

1139
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,480
and the engineer sends commands to that

1140
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,119
machine to use the credential and

1141
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,480
basically never has access to the

1142
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,079
credential itself

1143
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
like like isolating the engineer

1144
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,480
from the risk

1145
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,960
of exposing that credential by putting

1146
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,200
like a buffer where a machine

1147
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,720
does the job instead of the human

1148
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,640
and now

1149
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,319
once again we're going into fantasyland

1150
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,800
we can use a weaker credential maybe a

1151
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,160
credential that doesn't have access to

1152
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
pii but like how realistic is that once

1153
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,000
the system's already being built

1154
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,040
and like elimination it was an aws

1155
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,280
credential aws has a thing called roles

1156
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
that don't have passwords or keys or

1157
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,200
anything like that why not use a role

1158
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,000
why use a credential why not use a role

1159
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,319
well it turns out that

1160
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,440
the higher up uh controls are definitely

1161
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,760
more effective right like you're

1162
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,520
basically designing a system without the

1163
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,200
risk there's no risk if you do

1164
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,599
elimination there's no more risk

1165
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,720
but like

1166
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,520
in order to get those

1167
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,400
ones that are high up you need to move

1168
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
security to the left like you've all

1169
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,200
heard that but like this is why because

1170
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,319
these

1171
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,200
high

1172
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,960
controls over there these highly

1173
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,760
effective controls are only possible if

1174
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,839
you get in early enough on the design

1175
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,280
stage in order to to help engineers

1176
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,920
design a safer system

1177
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,880
and

1178
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,799
and and you know you can get to all of

1179
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:39,680
this

1180
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,079
using a root cause analysis you can do

1181
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,640
like a risk analysis to to get to like

1182
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,240
similar recommendations about inherently

1183
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
safer design and so on but this is an

1184
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,200
instant heuristic you can like keep that

1185
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,880
in your mind in the back of your mind at

1186
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,480
all times and you're like oh that's an

1187
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,520
engineering control oh that's an

1188
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,119
administrative control oh that's a

1189
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,720
process to prevent people from [ __ ]

1190
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,839
up well it's a process and

1191
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,960
administrative control is not good

1192
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,240
enough we want engineering controls we

1193
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,599
want substitution

1194
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,760
so you can use that as an instant

1195
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,200
heuristic

1196
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,439
to

1197
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,559
to design better systems without having

1198
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,200
to run through a lengthy analysis

1199
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,240
process all the time

1200
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,119
all right enough with the super abstract

1201
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,680
like kind of highly uh

1202
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,319
highly like you know like boring stuff

1203
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,119
let's talk about another example this

1204
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,280
one is that the siebels

1205
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,079
yes can be net in uh the ussr this

1206
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,000
happened in on december 13th of 1978

1207
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,359
this is the siberian chemical combine

1208
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,400
and

1209
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,359
they

1210
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,240
are

1211
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,200
handling certain chemicals

1212
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
uh plutonium they're handling plutonium

1213
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,599
all right no one knows what they could

1214
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,920
have possibly be doing with all that

1215
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,240
plutonium doing during the cold war it's

1216
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,920
a complete mystery

1217
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
they were using it to build nukes but

1218
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,920
anyway um

1219
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,640
so they were working at the uh at the

1220
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,720
siberian chemical combine

1221
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,880
and they had

1222
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,799
uh they were basically having these

1223
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
plutonium ingots

1224
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,799
that they were kind of moving around it

1225
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,400
was like almost pure plutonium they were

1226
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,559
doing some experiments of purity on them

1227
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,000
and so on

1228
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,520
and and basically they had these like

1229
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,520
little containers that were like

1230
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,280
radiation shielded and they could put

1231
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,520
the plutonium ingots in them

1232
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,359
and uh

1233
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,960
they were actually radiation shielded on

1234
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,040
all sides so you couldn't actually see

1235
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,559
inside them

1236
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,640
to tell you know where's the plutonium

1237
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,480
how many ingots there are like like i'm

1238
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,160
already saying that and like it's a

1239
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,839
recipe for disaster isn't it like you

1240
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,440
can't see the

1241
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,520
the plutonium anyway they had like

1242
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,799
very specific very effective checklists

1243
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,280
steps steps that they had to follow

1244
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,760
exactly in order to make sure that they

1245
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,599
didn't put too much plutonium in one of

1246
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,680
these uh

1247
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,240
in one of these containers

1248
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,200
uh

1249
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,640
now let's take a

1250
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,040
step and and think about like how nuts

1251
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,079
is it that we have this amount of detail

1252
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,119
on some top-secret process

1253
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,079
in russia in the cold war like i have no

1254
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,240
idea how the los alamos national

1255
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,760
laboratory got their hold of that the

1256
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,839
nuclear regulatory commission like like

1257
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:22,880
like

1258
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,839
what

1259
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,839
why did the soviets even share this

1260
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,520
stuff like

1261
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,359
but anyway we know about it and we know

1262
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,040
exactly what happened so we know what

1263
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,640
the process was you know like you had to

1264
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,559
move those ingots over there like they

1265
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,200
were like a huge you know piles of glove

1266
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,680
boxes imagine and and they kept moving

1267
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,119
plutonium between them so all right so

1268
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,440
they had to load eight and nine over

1269
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,839
there in this particular sequence and

1270
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,240
anyway in this particular situation

1271
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,240
they moved the this one was supposed to

1272
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,640
be empty by the way so what happened uh

1273
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,000
a guy uh had this process that he was

1274
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,359
supposed to follow

1275
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,559
and

1276
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,920
he

1277
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,880
got up in the middle of doing all this

1278
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,839
process

1279
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,920
and went to help someone else and then

1280
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,240
he called and is like hey hey can you

1281
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,079
help me out like like can you follow

1282
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,680
these process remove these ingots from

1283
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,559
over here uh to some other guy

1284
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,280
and then he like did his stuff came back

1285
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,359
to his workstation and never checked

1286
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,240
that the other guy like actually did the

1287
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,920
steps of the checklist that that he

1288
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,079
assumed were done so he just assumed

1289
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,480
that there was no plutonium over there

1290
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,440
so uh anyway uh so he moved another

1291
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,200
plutonium ingot so now there's two of

1292
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,359
them in this like vessel that's the

1293
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,799
administrative limit by the way that's

1294
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:37,839
an administrative control an

1295
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,280
administrative control says you cannot

1296
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,559
have more than two ingots in in one

1297
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,319
thingy thingamabob

1298
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,160
right but the guy didn't actually

1299
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,880
couldn't see well inside so uh you know

1300
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,599
like uh he didn't know

1301
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,960
uh

1302
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,680
so now there's two of them in there uh

1303
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,440
loading up another one from this process

1304
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,400
over here and uh

1305
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
and this is a good time to say that like

1306
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,839
what happens when you get so much

1307
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,680
plutonium in close proximity to each

1308
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,720
other like uh plutonium is uh highly

1309
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,880
radioactive but what happens is

1310
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
as you put more and more plutonium next

1311
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,359
to each other the

1312
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,559
the

1313
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,280
the little neutrons kind of kind of flop

1314
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,599
about and like hit these like

1315
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,960
uh

1316
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,359
hit the atoms of plutonium and they

1317
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,000
break the atoms apart releasing more

1318
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,480
neutrons that break apart more atoms and

1319
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
so on so basically the more plutonium

1320
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,799
you got in a confined space the more

1321
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,839
reactive it is the more dangerous it is

1322
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,960
and if you have too much it

1323
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,599
spontaneously explodes

1324
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,440
releasing a massive shock wave of

1325
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,520
radiation

1326
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,880
anyway

1327
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,680
uh

1328
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,559
guy

1329
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,599
uh got confused because he stepped away

1330
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,760
in the middle of his checklist

1331
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,319
and loaded up a third one over there

1332
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,480
they're only supposed to really be one

1333
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,240
maximum of two but like a third one's

1334
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,280
coming in

1335
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,440
don't put too many if you put too many

1336
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,680
they're gonna explode

1337
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,559
and uh and yeah you know like you can't

1338
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,400
see over the top you don't know how many

1339
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,160
they're in there and like uh [ __ ] uh

1340
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,440
dude loaded up the fourth ingot as soon

1341
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,680
as he did that the whole thing exploded

1342
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,680
like just exploded it was not a full-on

1343
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,079
nuclear explosion because the thing just

1344
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,520
just broke apart before that could

1345
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,599
happen but he put the ingot over there

1346
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,799
and boom

1347
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,040
like no warning no nothing

1348
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,200
eight people got irradiated

1349
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,359
some of them had uh

1350
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,200
long-term issues

1351
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,799
and uh and yeah it was it was nasty it

1352
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,480
was gnarly it was ugly and uh

1353
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,480
and it was all

1354
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,640
coming down to that checklist that

1355
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,400
wasn't followed exactly

1356
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,319
how many of you have seen such a

1357
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,400
checklist in security like how many of

1358
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,640
you have uh worked with a checklist like

1359
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,200
that that uh you know you have to follow

1360
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,960
these steps exactly and like if you

1361
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,040
deviate like bad things happen

1362
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,119
i i've seen that thing everywhere here's

1363
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,640
the checklist that i wrote yeah i wrote

1364
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,680
this piece of [ __ ] so you need to add uh

1365
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,520
the mutually contradictory rules i'm not

1366
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,880
gonna go into detail but like that

1367
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,640
sounds already like the first step in

1368
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,160
the checklist is something that sounds

1369
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,160
like absurd and out there so anyway you

1370
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
need to add something to a file you need

1371
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,960
to commit you need to deploy you need to

1372
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,000
manually run the thing then you need to

1373
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,040
remove the thing that you just added

1374
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,599
you commit again you push again you

1375
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,480
deploy again you run it again and then

1376
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,599
you like a pr and merge so like this is

1377
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,680
like a recipe for disaster because like

1378
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,599
an engineer's gonna come in

1379
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,000
and they're gonna be like why do you

1380
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,760
need to add this thing

1381
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,839
deploy and run and then remove the thing

1382
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,359
that you just added and deploy and run

1383
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,280
again why don't you just skip to like

1384
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,880
step five

1385
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,839
and actually an engineer came to me and

1386
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,160
and saw this saw this checklist

1387
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,880
in the documentation and asked me

1388
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,359
uh hey so i saw these this checklist

1389
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,359
like some of these steps seem redundant

1390
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,200
do you need to do we actually need to

1391
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
run all these steps yes run all the

1392
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,920
steps don't skip any and the guy was

1393
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,520
like what happens if i skip some of the

1394
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,400
steps

1395
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,319
well worst case scenario everyone gets

1396
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,119
admin access that's what happens

1397
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,280
this is a disaster this is a piece of

1398
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,119
[ __ ] process that's bound to fail

1399
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,799
that is absolutely bound to fail we're

1400
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,520
we're deprecating this by the way uh so

1401
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,400
uh this is like you know i'm i'm putting

1402
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,240
this out there like

1403
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,240
like like i'm sure we've all seen this

1404
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,880
or i hope i hope i'm the only one who's

1405
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,400
ever done something like this like i

1406
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,920
hope i'm the only one but i don't think

1407
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,680
i am

1408
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,359
so anyway like

1409
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,760
that's just like like having a checklist

1410
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,880
like that that you have to follow

1411
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,720
exactly that's like a recipe for

1412
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,400
disaster because like

1413
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,920
not everyone's a hundred percent

1414
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,280
perfectly attentive all the time

1415
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,000
and uh and if a [ __ ] up like results in

1416
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,599
disaster like

1417
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,760
like like what the hell so this gets me

1418
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,000
to the my next point which is the [ __ ]

1419
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,160
up factory this is not actually

1420
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,640
something that they use in industry but

1421
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,640
anyway like there's got to be a term for

1422
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,880
this so basically

1423
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,799
you know what i listed out over there

1424
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,680
with the plutonium accident with the

1425
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,359
little like checklist that you had to

1426
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,599
run and deploy in a specific order that

1427
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,240
means that there's no margin for error

1428
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,839
and you know there's

1429
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,680
inevitably there's going to be a [ __ ] up

1430
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,960
that's going to happen

1431
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,839
but like it gets even worse because the

1432
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,720
procedure itself can be really trolly it

1433
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,280
can like trick you into [ __ ] up like

1434
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,039
that thing with like remove and then

1435
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,200
that is like it just begs for someone to

1436
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,640
come in it's like i don't need these

1437
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,960
steps and you know i have like a lot of

1438
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,559
examples of [ __ ] up factories like uh

1439
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,920
like i was auditing our users in npm in

1440
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,720
our npm organization a while ago

1441
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,400
and uh

1442
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,839
we had a bunch of years that it was

1443
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,760
really confusing we had a

1444
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,960
user

1445
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,039
called j-o-h

1446
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,119
and then j and another user called

1447
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,799
j-o-h-n

1448
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,319
and they use another user called

1449
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,240
g-o-h-n-n

1450
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,359
and a user called johnny and i'm like

1451
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,440
what's going on why are they what's

1452
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,520
going on and it turns out that i wish i

1453
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,960
had a screenshot of this this was a

1454
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,799
while ago i hope they fixed it but

1455
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,960
basically you had your list of users and

1456
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,440
up at the top was a massive search box

1457
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,680
to be able to search for your users

1458
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,599
except that search box didn't search

1459
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,000
your user it just added a user to your

1460
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,760
organization with no confirmation no

1461
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,599
nothing so there was someone who was

1462
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,599
searching for johnny and type johs okay

1463
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,839
this guy isn't showing up g-o-h and guys

1464
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,000
why isn't the guy showing up and like

1465
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,240
and like he added like like like three

1466
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,480
four like five people to the

1467
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,920
organization

1468
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,240
without realizing because the thing was

1469
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,799
like design was a [ __ ] up factory it was

1470
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,880
it was it was very trolly it like

1471
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,359
trolled you into [ __ ] up

1472
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,640
so uh you know

1473
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,440
the

1474
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,520
one of the symptoms of a fuck-up factory

1475
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,119
one of the one of the things is is

1476
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,119
confusion it's like

1477
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,960
i didn't expect that like like i can't

1478
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,960
find that i was i'm sure the guy was in

1479
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,200
our organization why can't i find him

1480
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,000
and

1481
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,280
and that's like

1482
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,280
i keep that in mind all the time because

1483
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,440
that's like your radar for detecting bad

1484
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,119
processes for detecting checklists where

1485
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,720
someone's gonna [ __ ] up and so on where

1486
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,160
you're confused about the steps you're

1487
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,920
like which step was i had again like

1488
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,000
like what was i doing and so on like if

1489
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,839
you see that if you get a whiff of that

1490
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,960
confusion that means that there's a bad

1491
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,440
process there somewhere that can be

1492
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,119
fixed

1493
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,920
uh and uh and yeah that's like a big

1494
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,799
thing i i do think it's important to

1495
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,039
to keep that in mind

1496
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,400
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

1497
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,559
management pressures because uh there's

1498
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,720
another reason i brought up the siberian

1499
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,880
chemical combine and this example that i

1500
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,559
just had there were management pressures

1501
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,319
to get things done real fast you know it

1502
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,920
was the cold war like we needed those

1503
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,760
nukes and we needed them now

1504
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,640
uh

1505
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,920
you know

1506
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,280
move fast

1507
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,559
and uh same with with our situation move

1508
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,480
fast and

1509
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,400
what's the thing

1510
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,920
that

1511
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,520
breaks

1512
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,440
the quickest

1513
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,680
when you're talking about management

1514
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,200
pressures and that is your

1515
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,799
administrative controls change the way

1516
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,880
people work because people are going to

1517
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,280
instinctively optimize

1518
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,480
when they're under pressure they're

1519
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,400
going to instinctively optimize for

1520
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,960
speed and efficiency

1521
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,440
and that may come at the cost of

1522
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,119
security

1523
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,480
uh so that's what happens a lot of times

1524
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,640
like i'm sure the

1525
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,039
you know the the people who were like

1526
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,960
working at the siberian chemical combine

1527
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,839
like

1528
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,480
didn't follow the steps like exactly all

1529
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,400
the time and nothing bad happened you

1530
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,000
know like i see people all the time

1531
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,680
sharing credentials in slack they're not

1532
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,440
supposed to but it's very convenient and

1533
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,119
nothing bad happens

1534
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,440
and and you know like people are

1535
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,520
deviating from these like safe and

1536
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,400
secure processes and like

1537
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,480
and like nothing bad happens

1538
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,480
like nothing bad happens they do that

1539
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,240
once you know they put a credential in

1540
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,079
slack nothing bad happens they like

1541
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,440
yoink a machine credential from

1542
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,720
somewhere to use in troubleshooting

1543
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,880
nothing bad happens and

1544
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,680
you know nothing bad

1545
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,240
happens like keeps happening like like

1546
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,200
like like it's fine it's safe you know

1547
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,039
quote-unquote it seems safe

1548
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,760
and and and soon these processes get

1549
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,440
entrenched and these deviant behaviors

1550
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,359
that deviate from the proper safe

1551
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,160
behaviors like become the norm

1552
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,160
and this is actually

1553
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,240
has a term it's called normalization of

1554
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,799
deviance this is a big problem in

1555
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,039
industry which is you know people [ __ ]

1556
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,760
up people like cut corners and nothing

1557
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,960
bad happens

1558
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,640
you know nothing bad happens the first

1559
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,039
time the second time you know it can

1560
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,760
last for years

1561
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,760
then this leads me to my final two

1562
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,359
examples

1563
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,799
did you know

1564
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:13,680
that

1565
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,599
when the space shuttle challenger

1566
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:16,799
exploded

1567
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,120
the things that actually caused the

1568
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,359
disaster in the space shuttle challenger

1569
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,359
there were some o-ring seals that held

1570
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,439
the rocket boosters together did you

1571
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,839
know that those failed before

1572
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,479
they had a failure in 1981

1573
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,439
they had another failure in 1984. they

1574
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,759
had a failure in 1985.

1575
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,600
like all of those situations came really

1576
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,359
close to disaster you know they were

1577
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,799
brought up to management and they're

1578
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,479
like okay we're going to fix it

1579
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,479
eventually it's it's fine or whatever

1580
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,359
and then in 1986

1581
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,158
disaster struck you know all seven

1582
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,158
people who were on board of the shuttle

1583
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,960
died and this could have easily been

1584
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,439
prevented because they had three near

1585
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,920
misses they came close to disaster

1586
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,880
three

1587
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,839
separate times and they didn't do

1588
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,640
[ __ ]

1589
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,399
and here's another example and this is

1590
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,479
my final example this is a cable car in

1591
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,880
northern italy uh it's actually really

1592
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,560
picturesque there's like mountains over

1593
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,799
there and there's a lake and

1594
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,960
and the way these cable cars work that

1595
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,560
they have two cables there's one cable

1596
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,279
to actually keep the cable car like up

1597
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,279
and there's another one to actually pull

1598
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,439
it up the mountain

1599
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,158
uh and obviously they have like these

1600
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:31,600
things are very safe they have a lot of

1601
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,359
safety features and one of their main

1602
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,759
safety feature was the emergency brake

1603
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,839
uh when uh if the if the cable snaps and

1604
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,158
the thing starts rolling downhill

1605
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,479
there's an emergency brake that uh that

1606
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,198
that trips that that stops the car and

1607
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,799
everyone's safe

1608
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,640
but in this particular situation the

1609
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,238
emergency brake kept engaging like uh

1610
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,640
incorrectly you know the the thing would

1611
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,480
stop working they had to go in they had

1612
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,320
to fix it they had to

1613
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,840
to reset the emergency brake on a

1614
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,679
regular basis so

1615
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,280
they started turning it off they like

1616
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,280
disabled the emergency brake

1617
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,120
in order to

1618
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,760
make uh you know in order to make

1619
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,440
basically

1620
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,760
make it more efficient make it

1621
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,159
you know more convenient

1622
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:19,760
make it so that this thing actually

1623
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,520
works like there's a lot of pressure to

1624
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,960
make things work

1625
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,880
uh you need to

1626
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,480
keep things

1627
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,320
you need to keep things working and they

1628
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,679
keep telling you that like it's broken

1629
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,600
fix it fix it now fix it now fix it now

1630
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,199
and while the fix is you know the

1631
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,880
easiest fix is to disable the emergency

1632
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,679
brake

1633
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:36,960
and you know these cables are supposed

1634
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,320
to never snap

1635
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,080
like like they're really strong they

1636
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,880
never snap these cables never snap

1637
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,800
and yet

1638
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,159
by the way they've been doing this since

1639
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,080
2014 at least

1640
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,600
they've been disengaging the emergency

1641
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,760
brakes since 2014 and they were gonna

1642
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,960
get around to it eventually

1643
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,040
to properly fixing it but they never had

1644
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,480
the budget they never had the time and

1645
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,280
so on and the fix worked so for seven

1646
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,920
years they operated without a reliable

1647
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,840
working emergency break

1648
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
and then in 2021

1649
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,360
after seven years of nothing bad

1650
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,480
happening

1651
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
after this

1652
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
problematic

1653
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,440
process got entrenched

1654
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,800
the cable finally snapped

1655
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,400
the emergency brake didn't engage

1656
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,080
because it was disabled because everyone

1657
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,760
thought it was fine it had been fine for

1658
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,320
seven years after all why not

1659
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,080
and the cable car started sliding

1660
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,360
downwards

1661
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,120
and it crashed at the bottom of the

1662
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,400
mountain

1663
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,519
and 14 people died

1664
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,800
i'm going to stop the examples here

1665
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,920
you

1666
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,760
you get the picture

1667
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,320
and you know we we talk about these and

1668
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,520
in hindsight it's also obvious why did

1669
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,920
they disable the emergency brake it's so

1670
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,679
obvious that

1671
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,159
that something bad was going to happen

1672
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,600
uh you know

1673
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,480
why

1674
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,920
didn't the guy

1675
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,400
like watch the loading and unloading

1676
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,080
process why didn't

1677
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,560
they fix the problems with the o-rings

1678
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,440
in space shuttle challenger in hindsight

1679
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,239
it's also obvious it's painfully obvious

1680
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,480
it's painfully obvious

1681
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,600
and yet

1682
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,440
these things keep

1683
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,440
happening

1684
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,719
and that's

1685
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,400
why we need

1686
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,159
those controls

1687
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,080
that's why we need that strong security

1688
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,600
culture that's why we need that strong

1689
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,560
safety culture because when something is

1690
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,600
bad

1691
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,600
you don't want that to get entrenched

1692
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,159
you want people to pay attention and to

1693
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,560
speak up and you want to give people the

1694
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,800
freedom and the latitude and relieve the

1695
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,800
management pressures so that they can

1696
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,280
actually spend some time fixing their

1697
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,080
processes and prevent things from

1698
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,800
reaching disaster that's why you need a

1699
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
framework like that hierarchy of

1700
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,880
controls framework is great because you

1701
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,960
have something concrete to point out to

1702
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,400
management that actually no a checklist

1703
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,600
isn't like [ __ ] enough like a policy

1704
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,520
isn't enough you need like proper guard

1705
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,040
leads you need proper engineering

1706
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,080
controls you need security to be in at

1707
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,400
the design stage rather than coming in

1708
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,520
later

1709
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,440
and you know when you see a problem when

1710
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,960
you get a whiff

1711
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,440
of a problem pounce on it it's the right

1712
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,840
thing to do use this opportunity to make

1713
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,480
real change and prevent disaster in your

1714
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,080
enterprises

1715
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,560
and this leads me back

1716
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,600
to my final point

1717
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,480
which is near misses

1718
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,800
almost all of these situations have

1719
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,719
encountered a near miss at some point or

1720
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,000
another

1721
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,480
and you've had near misses as well maybe

1722
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,800
you almost like nuked that database

1723
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,400
maybe you you know

1724
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,360
you were in the wrong aws region and

1725
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,760
accidentally like almost opened up the

1726
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,000
wrong security group to the public

1727
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,920
maybe you know maybe these examples are

1728
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,840
like uh oddly specific maybe you wrote a

1729
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,440
command that were you were gonna run in

1730
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,760
prod uh it was gonna wipe out something

1731
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,600
bad but like you made a typo and like

1732
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,880
that type will save you and then you

1733
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,040
realize oh crap like those are near

1734
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,880
misses

1735
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,679
that thing with the credential that that

1736
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,080
got leaked we had a situation with

1737
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,239
an s3 bucket that was made public you

1738
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,000
know nothing was accessed these are all

1739
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,360
near misses

1740
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,040
and

1741
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,120
and and somehow

1742
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,199
like near misses mean that all of your

1743
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,640
controls failed

1744
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,679
like

1745
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,719
everything went bad and through sheer

1746
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,679
dumb [ __ ] luck the technology gods

1747
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,760
pulled you back from the brain and saved

1748
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,120
you this one time and you gotta treat

1749
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,440
near misses as if they actually happen

1750
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,360
because i see at a lot of organization

1751
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,600
they have an ear miss and they put it on

1752
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,440
the backlog they run the postmortem they

1753
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,880
put it on the back we're gonna deal with

1754
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,679
it eventually no the situation that

1755
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,320
caused that nearness to happen is still

1756
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,920
there those conditions are still present

1757
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,280
and that means that it will happen again

1758
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,440
guaranteed and next time you aren't

1759
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,440
going to get so lucky next time

1760
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,800
something bad will actually happen

1761
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,679
and you know you won't get so lucky

1762
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:16,880
and

1763
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,640
you know when when something like this

1764
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,600
happen

1765
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,000
telling people to you know just don't

1766
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,120
[ __ ] up

1767
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,280
that's that won't cut it

1768
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,239
you know just don't [ __ ] up is not an

1769
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:31,199
effective control

1770
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,880

1792
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,440
all right um so we begin again in just a

1793
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,600
couple of minutes i i did have at least

1794
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,239
one announcement while we figure out how

1795
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,920
to um

1796
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,080
bring our next presenter in who is going

1797
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,840
to be joining us remotely via

1798
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,199
science and technology

1799
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,120
um

1800
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,640
what was the announcement that i had

1801
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,679
okay yeah so uh park life will open

1802
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,640
for small items like you know

1803
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,280
chips and guac and tacos and stuff at 1

1804

you can

1807
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,320
crucially you can bring outside food

1808
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,800
into park life

1809
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,280
uh into the courtyard over there

1810
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,960
until 5 pm when when park life

1811
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,320
transforms back into a restaurant

1812
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,320
um

1813
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,000

approach you can like use your own

1816
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,840
device and watch summer con from the

1817
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,840
courtyard over there if you wish

1818

so the next thing that we got to do is

1825
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,760
figure out how to get

1826
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,280
audio

1827
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,120
from

1828
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,440

01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,440
um put up your slides or whatever the

1840
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,159
the case may be

1841
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,360
i'm glad we have a little extra time

1842
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,560
built in here for some of this

01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,280
i can i can definitely

1845
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,320
see you we now just need to get

1846
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,880
my system as a source of audio

1847
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,519
can you hear him

1848
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,520
yep

1849
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,480
yes

[Music]

1854
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,440
you would think after three years of um

1855
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,000
of of using zoom during a pandemic we

1856
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,239
would like this would be on on rails but

1857
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:03,040
uh i believe we are ready for you okay

1858
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,280
can you do me a favor and just play the

1859
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,639
test audio

1860
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,400
out of the zoom

1861
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,280
sure

1862
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,639
so he seems to be speaking

1863
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,320
can you pl yeah

1864
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,159
just make sure your audio is coming out

1865
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:26,320
of the headphone jack

1866
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,719
your settings

1867
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,639
it

1868
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,960
can you talk stanley

1869
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:06,239
how about now stanley

1870
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,839
we almost heard

1871
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:37,199
[Music]

1872
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,120
i'll use my computer for the audio if

1873
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,719
you send me the zoom link that we were

1874
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:42,000
not getting

1875
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
feedback

1876
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:01,320
have if you do it this way

1877
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,040

[Music]

1886
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,360
okay so um we believe that we can now we

1887
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,440
will now be able to hear

1888
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,960
dr barr

1889
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,360
if he is talking now

1890
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,120
over the pa and on the stream

1891
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,440
okay so

1892
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,239
let's let's see if i can't hear him but

1893
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:05,090
i also have bad hearing

1894
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:08,229
[Music]

1895
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,280
he's talking

1896
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,320
he's he's yes

1897
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,800
yeah so he's definitely talking and i

1898
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,000
don't hear him over the pa

1899
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,480
if you turn your volume back on and i'll

1900
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,400
mute your mic and then we'll be set

1901
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,760
okay

1902
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,000
my volume is on

1903
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but mute your input

1904
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,960
my zoom is muted

1905
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,920
yes

1906
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,560
i'm

1907
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,800
recording and engage it's a new

1908
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,440
framework that mighter is is pushing and

1909
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,000
offering to the community and it is

1910
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,199
really about

1911
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,320
helping us

1912
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,040
in those bad moments when bad things

1913
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,440
happen to us so i'm going to continue on

1914
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,199
i don't see any um

1915
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,800
any messages so i'm going to assume that

1916
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,159
you guys can see

1917
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,840
so the first thing i'm going to do is

1918
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,920
i'm going to start by framing how we

1919
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,880
um you know when we try and deny all

1920
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,560
those different things

1921
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,400
but there is another opera there's

1922
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,159
another opportunity that we're offered

1923
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,960
right cyber deception is the idea of how

1924
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,560
do we reveal and conceal deceptive facts

1925
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,639
and fictions to mislead or confuse our

1926
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,600
adversary so having a a set of

1927
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,440
credentials in prod

1928
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,400
that uh no one should know about um and

1929
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,280
if someone uses those credentials could

1930
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,639
uh alert us now that's that's uh that's

1931
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,199
that's playing the game right and so um

1932
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,800
the other thing that it does is it

1933
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,119
offers you plausible deniability right

1934
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,119
it's having a couple fake sets of creds

1935
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,639
and maybe a real one that gets popped

1936
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,320
every once in a while you can say oh i

1937
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,480
have fake preds and uh i'm not going to

1938
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,320
tell you but this uh this may have been

1939
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,119
a whole deception operation right and so

1940
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:21,199
the idea of of deception is to misflee

1941
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,600
and we think about these things together

1942
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,920
in adversary engagement and we put all

1943
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,679
those things together using planning and

1944
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:28,960
analysis and i'm going to talk to you

1945
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,719
about the mitre framework that we've

1946
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,800
developed to start thinking about this

1947
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,920
to to help use denial and deception and

1948
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,800
engage with our adversaries

1949
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,239
so i'm going to start over here's how

1950
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,400
i'm going to give my talk today i'm

1951
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,840
going to talk about things that we've

1952
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,840
learned at mitre um how we have uh we're

1953
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,080
sharing what we learned uh what's going

1954
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,239
on in the community and what

1955
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,360
opportunities there are out in the world

1956
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,440
uh so what have we learned so let me

1957
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,600
just tell you uh when i started with

1958
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,400
this

1959
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,960
i started with this in 2005 i was

1960
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,040
working on uh miters uh infosec team and

1961
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,840
i was looking at how to deal with our

1962
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,679
apt response right that's the advanced

1963
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,440
persistent threat the people who come

1964
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,840
back again and again and let me just

1965
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,679
tell you what i learned then and i think

1966
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,320
is still true true today is that we

1967
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,679
spent way too much time on indicators

1968
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,000
that other people gave us right and when

1969
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,560
other people's give you indicators

1970
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,239
they're their indicators they're what's

1971
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:33,679
happening on their network and that has

1972
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,880
relative uh value to you because maybe

1973
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,639
they're using the same tools maybe

1974
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:41,280
they're using the same c2s maybe they're

1975
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,360
using the same mexfill channels but

1976
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,520
maybe they're not right and so that made

1977
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,760
it difficult to discover much on our

1978
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,440
production network

1979
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,520
and you know with a limited

1980
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,600
understanding of how all these ttps

1981
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,440
worked it it gave us very few options uh

1982
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,800
for post compromise incident response

1983
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,560
and so we wanted to stay we want to

1984
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,639
change this game we want to stop

1985
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,719
worrying about you know the individual

1986
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,119
exploits today what can we do to change

1987
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,440
that game how do we interact with our

1988
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,280
adversary how do we start putting

1989
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,679
together an asymmetric advantage that

1990
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,159
the defender has

1991
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:19,920
so let me just tell you this this is a

1992
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,159
long-term study uh this isn't a great

1993
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,159
book that some of my um

1994
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:25,440
my uh

1995
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,199
you know my betters at miter i don't

1996
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,880
wanna i was about to call them my peers

1997
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
maybe my colleagues but definitely

1998
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,800
people smarter than me put together in

1999
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,520
mitre and in 2010 to 2012 we did a long

2000
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,400
term uh analysis of a of a particular

2001
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,600
adversary and what we learned is um in

2002
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,480
2000 in 2008 2010

2003
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,159
everyone was afraid of the next cve

2004
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:53,840
right and what we found is that the cves

2005
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,280
are ephemeral

2006
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,159
every time that they try and exploit us

2007
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,800
they get they those things get rolled up

2008
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,440
right a patch tuesday fixes that and the

2009
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,000
next release of whatever fixes whatever

2010
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,639
it was but what we learned this doing a

2011
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,360
lot of analysis and running a lot of

2012
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,840
malware from a particular group that we

2013
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,000
were looking at is we found out that

2014
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,480
they had very few

2015
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,040
post compromise tools the way they

2016
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,119
actually did their command and control

2017
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,360
the way they executed their mission and

2018
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,600
the way maintain the way they maintain

2019
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,960
their presence

2020
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,239
was much smaller and and

2021
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,080
more reused

2022
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,199
uh than any of the cves and so we also

2023
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,800
learned is through running these pieces

2024
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,960
of malware and understanding them we

2025
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,639
started to understand how they did their

2026
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,239
reconnaissance how they weaponized

2027
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,880
things and how they delivered them and

2028
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,159
this is sort of was a big uh eye-opening

2029
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:52,880
moment for us i think we all knew these

2030
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,480
things uh

2031
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,000
natively or intrinsically but we never

2032
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,920
stop to consider

2033
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,600
if they only have a small amount of

2034
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,119
implants that they can use later on

2035
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,360
than trying to understand

2036
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,440
how they use their tools when they get

2037
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,480
access

2038
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,239
can provide you

2039
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,679
an idea and some comfort when you're not

2040
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,480
sure if you have covered

2041
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:24,400
all those cves right because you can

2042
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,560
start thinking about what are they going

2043
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,400
to use what's their host-based thing

2044
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,840
what's their host-based signatures going

2045
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,199
to look like what's their network

2046
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,199
signatures going to look like and and

2047
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:34,800
this sort of allows you to think about

2048
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,600
this in a different way and feel a lot

2049
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,520
more confidence that you can cover

2050
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,360
things when you know

2051
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,679
what comes next

2052
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,280
so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this uh

2053
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,040
this uh this was supposed to be a build

2054
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,920
and i uh somehow i made him as i screwed

2055
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,360
this briefing up this is supposed to be

2056
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,199
a build right here and it's supposed to

2057
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,119
start off with talking about initial

2058
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,280
intelligence and initial intelligence of

2059
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,119
the things that you get from a partner

2060
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:01,440
right oh we saw this hash if you see

2061
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,280
this hash come in through whatever

2062
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,400
mechanism uh it's bad uh oh you see this

2063
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,119
domain it's bad or or this ip address

2064
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,760
it's bad um and so this right here we

2065
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,679
took a um

2066
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,440
10 different

2067
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,560
um encounters we had and we we labeled

2068
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,760
them out we're not going to talk about

2069
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,600
who they were we don't talk about who we

2070
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,119
interact with uh for bad guys uh but we

2071
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,840
started out with a couple indicators of

2072
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,480
compromise and then from there when we

2073
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:34,719
ran their malware we learned a ton more

2074
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,960
we learned about um you know what their

2075
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,280
domains were what their what their ip

2076
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,600
addresses were all sorts of different

2077
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,760
things that that we found out and in

2078
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,400
running those malware campaigns

2079
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,119
we found out that our adversaries uh use

2080
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:52,639
on average six to nine tools um there

2081
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,560
were some over here g

2082
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,119
seem to just have a pile of different

2083
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,320
tools they wanted to try out or use

2084
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,679
so we uh we collected uh all those tools

2085
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,080
that they they built and they ran on our

2086
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,080
network right from there we built some

2087
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,600
signatures uh for detecting those tools

2088
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,520
some of them are host-based some of them

2089
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,080
are network-based but we uh we focused

2090
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,080
on that and the last thing we did was we

2091
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,800
built a lot of decoders and so we use

2092
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,920
decoders to look inside uh traffic uh

2093
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,159
some some crypto makes it harder to do

2094
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,480
with other types of crypto but you know

2095
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,800
where we can we build the coders because

2096
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,520
that allows us something to do in our uh

2097
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,080
in our response to look at uh what might

2098
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,639
have happened hopefully that makes sense

2099
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,520
uh if anyone has questions by the way

2100
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,199
put them in the chat and we'll address

2101
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,520
them at the end of the time i'm just

2102
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,000
gonna move on um and by the way this is

2103
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,840
a little rough because i don't even have

2104
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
hear any of the the background noise

2105
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,760
down there i'm i'm completely hoping

2106
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,440
that i'm talking and that i'm connected

2107
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,760
to zoom because i get no feedback

2108
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,880
whatsoever right so what did mitre do

2109
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,639
right so miter has collected uh

2110
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,320
roughly 12 years now of

2111
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,840
of analysis 12 14 years of analytics of

2112
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,000
what we learned from bad guys we

2113
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,679
encountered with them and we put

2114
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,000
together a framework and our framework

2115
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,920
is about how to deal with your

2116
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,239
adversaries right so mitre engage is

2117
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,719
about it's a framework it's for planning

2118
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,800
and discussing how you do these

2119
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,880
activities you know what happens when

2120
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,880
things go bump in the night and miter

2121
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,000
really is is is invested in these type

2122
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,880
of things we want to help more people

2123
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,040
and more organizations

2124
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,480
do operations uh within and across the

2125
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,239
public private sectors right we want to

2126
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:45,920
work with government we want to work

2127
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,000
with private industry we want to work

2128
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,760
with academics we want to work with

2129
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,800
anyone who wants to unravel what is

2130
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,840
going on with our

2131
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,280
adversaries um i will say that you know

2132
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,520
this is in some ways this is a plug for

2133
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,679
our framework but more i want to talk to

2134
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,440
you about sort of the things that went

2135
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,880
into this right so we put together a

2136
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,719
matrix which we're going to explore we

2137
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,560
have a bunch of stuff about uh

2138
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,400
actionable playbook you can go download

2139
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,560
this for free everything that mitre does

2140
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,760
is open and available for anyone else we

2141
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,119
put together a process which we're going

2142
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,600
to talk about um we have a community of

2143
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,600
people that we work to do operations

2144
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,600
with and if you are interested in

2145
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,760
working in a community of people who are

2146
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,480
doing operations uh reach out to engage

2147
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,880
at mitre.org uh it should be on the

2148
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,520
front and last page of this briefing

2149
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,440
um and we're trying to actually help

2150
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,840
more people create that mindset so i'm

2151
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,159
going to give you a a an in-depth sort

2152
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:42,480
of view of our mindset and hopefully you

2153
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,480
guys find this interesting right so

2154
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,480
let's start off with the engage matrix

2155
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,440
um

2156
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,920
so i'm interested and i i wish i could

2157
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,480
see your hands who here has ever heard

2158
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,560
of barton whaley if you're online and

2159
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,639
you've heard of barton whaley

2160
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,920
let me know in the in the chat um but

2161
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,159
barton whaley is the 20th century's uh

2162
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:08,159
premier expert on on uh putting together

2163
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,719
the art and science of military

2164
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,639
deception so he has a tome it's like 750

2165
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,040
pages of of

2166
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:21,280
of 20th century um uh deception

2167
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,280
operations that government have taken on

2168
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,000
and so barton whaley put together uh a

2169
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,040
process for how you go about doing

2170
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,360
deception operations so uh

2171
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,199
we at mitre we looked at that we tried

2172
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,600
to figure out what's important what what

2173
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,639
in the physical world transcends to the

2174
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,960
cyber world and how do we take a

2175
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,960
framework and an understanding that

2176
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,440
people have done over time and bring

2177
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,960
that into the cyber game so um what we

2178
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,280
did is we looked at uh barton whaley's

2179
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,080
uh seven step process uh i too am a

2180
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,159
doctor like barton was so i felt like

2181
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,760
i'll take your seven steps i'll add

2182
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,080
three steps presto magic i've uh i've

2183
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,560
added to the body of knowledge right so

2184
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,639
um so here's here's how barton uh uh

2185
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,600
started off this he said step one right

2186
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,600
assess your knowledge of your

2187
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,719
adversaries and yourself right son

2188
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,960
told us a long time ago

2189
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,920
know yourself and know your adversaries

2190
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,920
and you don't have to fear

2191
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,639
the outcome of a thousand battles right

2192
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,600
and that that really is it is start with

2193
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,679
what you know about who your adversary

2194
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,920
is and what you know about your

2195
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,000
vulnerabilities your strength and your

2196
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,320
organization and so that that's a way to

2197
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,880
start and you may not know a lot about

2198
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,280
your adversaries you may not even know a

2199
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,360
lot about your organization

2200
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,119
having done a lot of deception

2201
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,840
operations having run a lot of malware

2202
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,080
um in my time i have seen things that um

2203
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:55,360
i wish i didn't see uh uh that i that i

2204
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,920
didn't expect to happen uh that my

2205
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,159
adversary did and sort of things that i

2206
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,480
didn't think would be revealed about

2207
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,920
what i was doing because i hadn't

2208
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,920
planned right so the first thing you

2209
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,760
start doing in here is you start looking

2210
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,560
at your operational objectives what are

2211
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,119
you trying to accomplish what one nugget

2212
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:15,360
would you like to pull on that will help

2213
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,040
you understand yourself or your

2214
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,520
adversary a little better right and so

2215
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,639
you lay this plan out and you help your

2216
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,400
just determine what you want your

2217
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,239
adversary how they want how you want

2218
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,480
them to react right what do you want

2219
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,400
your adversary to do

2220
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,560
and you may start there and you may go

2221
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,239
well you know we have an apt abc problem

2222
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,560
and i know that that particular

2223
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,159
adversary uses meaning cats okay so if

2224
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,159
they use mimic cats then you probably

2225
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,760
want to have some credentials for them

2226
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,920
to pull right so you start figuring out

2227
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,600
what do you want them to do i'd like

2228
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,840
them to pull and use fake credentials

2229
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,520
okay step you know the next step step

2230
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,679
four what do you want them to perceive

2231
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,760
what do you want um what do you want

2232
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,760
them to think there are credentials here

2233
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,920
to harvest me me cats would be a great

2234
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,800
tool to use right you know determine

2235
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,480
how you engage with your adversary

2236
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,320
determine what channels they see you

2237
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,119
through are you pretending to be a

2238
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:15,600
fortune 10 company well you should

2239
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,440
probably have a big network unless

2240
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,600
you're a remote user right are you

2241
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,480
claiming that you're uh that your domain

2242
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,119
is uh some sort of company well you

2243
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,679
better make sure that you have uh bought

2244
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:31,760
a used uh domain on on one of the uh the

2245
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,000
services there so you actually have that

2246
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,480
craft that that shows a legacy right

2247
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,960
proves your legend of of who you are

2248
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,440
right what is it the next step is you

2249
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,360
determine what is your success what is

2250
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,320
your dating right and and the idea is

2251
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,119
when do i call this successful

2252
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,360
when do i decide i want an adversary to

2253
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,920
do this and when i get that i'm gonna do

2254
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,960
that or an other thing or a final thing

2255
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,360
and when do i pull the plug and this

2256
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,320
whole idea of deception and adversary

2257
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,440
engagement

2258
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,679
you notice that that is the preparing

2259
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,159
step and this is where i think a lot of

2260
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,920
people think i'm just gonna run some

2261
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,520
malware on a machine and see what

2262
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,520
happens right and you can do that and

2263
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,199
you will learn something

2264
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:17,280
but actually having a preparation

2265
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,960
process and actually figuring out what

2266
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,119
your gating criteria are and all these

2267
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:23,520
other things will help you execute your

2268
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,400
operation or your operations right the

2269
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,840
next thing you do is during your

2270
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,080
operation and once it's commenced you

2271
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,080
start turning your raw data that you're

2272
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,199
collecting into uh intelligence it's

2273
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,880
actionable intelligence

2274
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,560
feedback data intelligence who are your

2275
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,800
stakeholders if you're an infosec guy

2276
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,119
you know your stakeholders are both um

2277
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,400
the cso and the cio right the cso is

2278
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,480
making sure that you're secure but the

2279
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,560
cio wants to know am i buying the right

2280
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,159
stuff are we getting the right things in

2281
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:53,679
place um

2282
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,080
analyze your successes and failures

2283
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,440
i have learned so much more

2284
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,840
through my failures and through the

2285
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,480
things i broke and through the things i

2286
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:07,199
didn't figure out before than i have

2287
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,760
ever learned through actually working a

2288
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,119
problem through and actually having

2289
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,960
success early on and i think that's

2290
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,440
that's true of us all so don't don't

2291
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,920
think about failure as bad think about

2292
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,400
failure as feedback

2293
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,320
um so miter put together another

2294
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,159
framework uh this is the engage

2295
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,880
framework um so you see here that what

2296
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,159
we've tried to do is help people think

2297
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:31,440
about

2298
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,840
preparing the battlefield

2299
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,760
for by planning

2300
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,960
and understanding uh what happens during

2301
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,360
the battle and then in the middle you

2302
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,960
have different things that you might

2303
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,480
want to achieve right so the way we

2304
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:48,000
broke this down is we have um we have

2305
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,040
goals

2306
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,679
activities and approaches so the very

2307
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,760
top things are your goals i want to

2308
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,480
prepare i want to expose an adversary i

2309
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,040
want to have an effect on an adversary i

2310
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,119
want to elicit things from my adversary

2311
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:04,080
or i want to understand right and within

2312
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,280
those particular goals you start going

2313
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,159
to approaches well uh one approach for

2314
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:11,679
preparing is to plan we don't have

2315
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,239
another one but we have one right the

2316
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,400
things that you might do and expose an

2317
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,159
adversary is you might do some

2318
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,119
collection or detection and and i'm not

2319
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,119
going to go all the way across but

2320
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,360
anyone who i i will take mention it

2321
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,679
listen right so illicit is probably one

2322
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,440
of the ones that people have the most

2323
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,679
trouble with so in sometimes we want to

2324
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,000
reassure our adversary we want to make

2325
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
sure that when our adversary is running

2326
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,480
in a particular part of our uh

2327
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,679
environment

2328
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:42,719
that they feel comfortable running there

2329
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,679
and uh the goal is to get them to to use

2330
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,080
more tool we want to motivate them we

2331
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,159
want to motivate them so they they do

2332
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,639
more things where they are right and so

2333
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,520
if we reassure them and we motivate them

2334
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,320
we can actually start figuring out what

2335
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,719
can they do what would they do right

2336
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,719
this is like a giant rat maze where

2337
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,800
we're trying to get them to move through

2338
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,800
and we're trying to get them to do uh

2339
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,440
things and then the exact opposite is

2340
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,840
the effect right and so you sometimes

2341
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,679
want to make them more comfortable you

2342
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,599
want to make them feel like they're in

2343
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:18,960
charge uh and sometimes you want to uh

2344
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,480
make them feel that they're not in

2345
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,960
charge and that you want to uh

2346
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,880
you know do things that make them

2347
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,199
fearful like for instance if you can't

2348
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:30,320
defend a machine on your network run tcp

2349
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,880
dump on it write it to a network share

2350
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,639
even if you delete all the files after

2351
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,800
it after a day maybe they look at it and

2352
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,800
they go oh my god this thing has got tcp

2353
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,920
dump running on it and they're

2354
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,920
collecting right now you know put put

2355
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,280
idle

2356
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,280
on there put put wireshark on there if

2357
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,639
you don't want them to run there because

2358
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,199
maybe they run away right and so we're

2359
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:51,599
your weak appear strong and where you're

2360
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,159
strong appear weak another another thing

2361
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:57,119
from uh from sun tzu

2362
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,360
as i said we talk about these strategic

2363
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,599
actions we're book ending them

2364
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:03,520
we put these things in the middle as we

2365
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,960
said i got a little ahead of myself i

2366
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,800
got excited sorry about that

2367
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,280
um we're talking about our goals we talk

2368
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,119
about the approaches by which we do

2369
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,239
things and ultimately the uh these

2370
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,960
activities allow us accomplished

2371
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:18,159
approaches right and i'm going to get

2372
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:20,400
into this in the next slide a little

2373
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,840
more depth in depth so um you probably

2374
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,880
are familiar with attack tactics and

2375
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,080
techniques

2376
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,280
and we decided to change our wording so

2377
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,880
that we didn't have

2378
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,440
uh techniques and tactics so that you

2379
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,159
could talk about engage and attack in

2380
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,280
the same sentence so where um where

2381
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,880
attack has tactics and techniques we map

2382
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,800
a technique

2383
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,360
to an activity right and so we are going

2384
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,960
to show you how that happens in the next

2385
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,520
couple slides right so here's how we do

2386
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,040
things with um with miter attack

2387
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:00,480
um so there's a the way attack works is

2388
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,159
they have a technique right when a

2389
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,639
specific adversary performs a specific

2390
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,920
action uh that's an attack technique we

2391
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,639
map it to an adversary vulnerability and

2392
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,400
that is uh what what are they vulnerable

2393
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:17,199
to when they ask that question and

2394
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,520
ultimately an engage activity so what

2395
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,679
what does that mean right so here's what

2396
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:24,400
you learned during cyber operations that

2397
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,599
your adversary asks a question

2398
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,520
to drive down ambiguity that they have

2399
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,159
about what's going on the reason why

2400
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,599
they're operating is they're trying to

2401
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:37,679
steal data they're trying to make sure

2402
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,360
they're in the right place they're

2403
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,080
trying to you know uh persist or

2404
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,199
whatever

2405
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:46,800
when they ask you a question they expose

2406
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,560
something that they want an answer to

2407
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,800
and that's their vulnerability and so

2408
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,239
when you understand what their

2409
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:56,159
vulnerability is

2410
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,800
you can create an activity

2411
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,560
that um that exploits their

2412
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:01,679
vulnerability and let's go into

2413
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:04,159
something a very uh reveal their uh

2414
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,560
vulnerabilities uh so the defender can

2415
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,040
take an advantage for your defensive

2416
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,880
purpose right exactly

2417
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,800
so let's talk about this very specific

2418
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:16,719
one so there is a attack uh technique uh

2419
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:19,520
1018 which is remote system discovery

2420
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,800
right so when your adversary scans a

2421
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,159
network

2422
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:28,960
to find uh lateral movement targets

2423
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,360
that's because they don't feel

2424
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,760
they're on the right place or they want

2425
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,800
to find more juicy places or they want

2426
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,599
to do something else right and so that's

2427
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,599
their vulnerability is they're asking

2428
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:44,159
where else can i go

2429
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,480
and that's why we have an engagement

2430
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,040
activity called laws

2431
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,520
and this helps them when they try and do

2432
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,880
their ninja thing of moving using a

2433
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:58,480
attack technique 1018 you have lures on

2434
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:01,119
the network that makes them

2435
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:02,960
have to really think about one they

2436
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,639
either do it and they don't know they've

2437
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,960
been caught or they think that uh

2438
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,960
deception is in play and they have to

2439
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,119
make deliberate decisions about how they

2440
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,840
move and so this is one example for

2441
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,280
everything you see in the engaged matrix

2442
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,599
um and i'll just go back here for

2443
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,480
everything you see here like lures um

2444
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,920
there is a

2445
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,560
uh a particular there is a set

2446
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,679
of

2447
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,520
attack mappings

2448
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,560
that

2449
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,119
result in these these particular

2450
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,159
um activities being being useful so for

2451
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:38,320
we have mapped every single attack

2452
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:41,440
technique to one of these and we have

2453
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,199
mapped them to multiple of these

2454
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:46,080
depending on which uh particular attack

2455
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,719
techniques some of them are very limited

2456
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:51,199
some of them are are uh

2457
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:53,760
some activities that an adversaries have

2458
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,560
are susceptible to multiple different

2459
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:59,520
types of deception but we uh i i love

2460
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,199
you guys to go through this through the

2461
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,440
matrix if you go to engage.micro.org and

2462
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,360
you double uh click on any of these

2463
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:08,400
things you will find that um and feel

2464
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,000
free to wander through if you find

2465
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,159
anything that's uh that's missing that

2466
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:16,000
you think is uh needs more uh exposition

2467
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,320
feel free to send an email to to engage

2468
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:21,280
at mitre.org we are looking to uh to

2469
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,719
collaborate with more people

2470
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,599
so um so how do we operationalize this

2471
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:29,840
right so what we're trying to do what we

2472
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,080
do it might or what i do at mitre what

2473
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,679
my team does it might or what other

2474
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,080
people do um is that you know we have

2475
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,320
this idea of uh of doing these

2476
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:41,679
operations right we have one operation

2477
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,840
it doesn't matter i will tell you that

2478
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,880
the very first operation i did

2479
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,400
was uh this was a long time ago it was

2480
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:54,159
just uh a bare bones window xp machine

2481
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:57,280
that's right windows xp and it had a

2482
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,880
mifi and uh it had peak cap collection

2483
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,520
and so i took a a sample that someone

2484
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,760
gave me called uh you know whatever it

2485
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:08,719
was dot exe i double clicked on it and i

2486
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,960
think in that case it opened up a

2487
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,679
powerpoint and presto magic it was off

2488
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:16,800
to the races so i had some i had taken a

2489
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,119
snapshot of the file system before i'd

2490
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:20,960
taken a snapshot of the file system

2491
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,440
after and i actually just did some pcap

2492
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,400
analysis

2493
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:27,599
and presto magic i learned what they did

2494
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,560
uh and and we started going gee they're

2495
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,880
going to use registry keys to to to

2496
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,199
install persistence back in the day oh

2497
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:37,840
here is their network dump here's where

2498
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,000
they're going so now i could actually

2499
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,880
start telling my uh my friends put these

2500
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,159
iocs in your in your scene uh and you'll

2501
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:47,760
start collecting right so we analyze

2502
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,199
those behaviors

2503
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,199
then from that we started identifying

2504
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,280
other opportunities it's like boy i

2505
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,920
don't really know exactly

2506
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,440
what's going on

2507
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:01,679
in uh the host system so we start um we

2508
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,400
start identifying opportunities for

2509
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,599
research

2510
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,239
right what can we do

2511
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:12,480
that will help us um analyze or identify

2512
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,840
what's going on

2513
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,639
in our bad guy operations uh much

2514
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:17,520
quicker

2515
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,360
and a lot easier and so we took all

2516
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,199
those things that we learned from those

2517
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,760
adversary behaviors and we then

2518
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,800
implemented them into other operations

2519
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,719
right and so this is a cycle it's a

2520
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,520
virtuous cycle do whatever you have

2521
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,560
today

2522
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,080
make sure and and by the way i'm going

2523
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,920
to put in a point right here i'll i'll

2524
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:40,080
put in a plug um you hear a lot of

2525
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,639
deception vendors say things to you like

2526
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,119
uh buy our appliance and then take your

2527
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,440
organization's gold disk put it into our

2528
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,040
appliance and then when an adversary

2529
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:52,320
runs on your uh runs in your vm um

2530
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,000
they'll think they're in your real

2531
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,119
network and um and and you'll be able to

2532
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,599
collect on them that's great and all but

2533
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,840
do we really want to train our

2534
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:04,400
adversaries to operate on our networks

2535
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,639
right so one of the things that we we

2536
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:09,040
learned early on is and there's some

2537
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,800
there were some things once or twice

2538
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,280
that i wish uh i had i had done

2539
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,360
differently um they learned things that

2540
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,599
i didn't want them to know right so we

2541
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,599
we we um we develop these engagements we

2542
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,159
see what they do we learn that we should

2543
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,520
not use your gold image uh we we make

2544
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,320
our our images custom you make your your

2545
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,199
engagement custom so that you have a

2546
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:36,320
tell that you might be able to use later

2547
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,040
on another operation to see if they come

2548
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,760
back and i won't talk about a number of

2549
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,480
things that we did here but um if if

2550
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,480
you're interested in this kind of thing

2551
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,320
uh in in private uh private

2552
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,480
conversations mitre has a slack channel

2553
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,199
a slack workspace where we uh where we

2554
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:55,199
work with people and we exchange ideas

2555
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:58,400
with people let me know and we can um

2556
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,320
and we can exchange uh

2557
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:03,679
uh war stories and uh ideas on how to

2558
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,560
improve this stuff

2559
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,920
um so i want to talk a little bit about

2560
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:13,920
this um you know we we built a a starter

2561
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,000
kit and so if you want to come to mitre

2562
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,480
engage and look at our starter kit on

2563
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,719
how you can get started in adversary

2564
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:23,360
engagement um we would love you to come

2565
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,760
and look at it download it uh start

2566
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:29,119
thinking about is this right for you

2567
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,440
um and and i think that we we want to

2568
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,040
find out you know

2569
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,199
is this working for you if if you want

2570
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,280
to try and do start if you really want

2571
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,280
to try and start adversary engagements

2572
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,280
mitre wants to help you miter wants to

2573
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,760
work with you we are interested in

2574
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,520
helping everyone

2575
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,040
sort of uh

2576
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,040
you know get through this

2577
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,520
uh and get um

2578
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,800
and get

2579
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:55,280
get these operations going help more

2580
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,119
people do things we also have a

2581
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,360
practical guide as well so we're trying

2582
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,719
to put forth and put out materials

2583
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:05,040
that will help us all

2584
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,840
um

2585
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,880
do this better the the way meyer really

2586
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,679
believes that the utility of this is if

2587
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,320
we can get more people doing this if we

2588
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,480
can get more defenders

2589
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,360
doing deception experiments than there

2590
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,520
are bad guys and i think there are more

2591
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:24,000
defenders than there really are bad guys

2592
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,760
we can slow them down

2593
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,599
we can negatively impact their

2594
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,320
operations you know we can make it so

2595
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:34,639
that cyber is just as perilous as

2596
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,719
doing human or doing other types of

2597
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,480
things and we want to make our

2598
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,199
adversaries uncomfortable so i i hope

2599
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,360
that i can encourage you to to reach out

2600
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,920
after this send us an email at mitre

2601
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,840
engage.migrate.org

2602
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,679
um and and we want to work with other

2603
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,760
people

2604
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,920
so i i i thought it would be good for

2605
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,920
you guys to figure out what is going on

2606
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,320
in the community right so this is miters

2607
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:02,159
uh miters um you know talk on deception

2608
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:04,400
and but it's not just us mitre is not

2609
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,480
the only one talking about deception in

2610
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,440
the world

2611
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,080
why is deception important um i don't

2612
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:13,119
know i in the room how many uh people

2613
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:15,840
here uh i wish i could see their hands

2614
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,239
right now how many people are stuck with

2615
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:21,360
uh 853 where they work right and anyone

2616
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:25,280
in the chat uh feel free to to pipe in

2617
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,119
if your organization

2618
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:30,400
is is stuck dealing with 853 right so

2619
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:33,520
853 for those who don't know

2620
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,679
is in this document that puts out

2621
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:38,239
security and privacy controls for

2622
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:40,080
information systems and organization

2623
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,159
right that's the name of it a lot of

2624
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,159
great work in there it is the risk

2625
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:47,280
mitigation framework um

2626
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:50,159
deception is now a control

2627
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:54,400
that is in 853 so nist is starting to

2628
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:57,199
come around and starting to see that we

2629
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:59,840
can't keep our adversaries out of our

2630
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,480
networks we're never going to keep them

2631
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,719
out of our networks and why is that why

2632
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:06,080
are we never going to keep them out of

2633
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,239
our networks because as the last speaker

2634
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:10,080
was talking about

2635
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,560
human beings write code human beings

2636
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,599
configure networks human beings test all

2637
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,560
these things and um you know we have our

2638
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,560
own tests we have you know what we think

2639
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,119
is right but our adversaries you know

2640
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:25,360
they're motivated to get in and they are

2641
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:27,840
not going to quit if they have a mission

2642
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,159
so the only thing we can really do is we

2643
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:33,360
can uh change the calculus that makes

2644
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,880
them uncomfortable when they get to

2645
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,639
their network like this is the seventh

2646
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:38,480
time i've been here and i always get a

2647
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,400
shell what is going on here i don't

2648
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,639
think this is right or uh putting

2649
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:44,080
something up that tells them you're in a

2650
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,520
deception environment you're in a

2651
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,800
honeypot right is maybe every production

2652
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,599
machine should have the word honeypot as

2653
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,760
the background screen right what would

2654
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:55,280
that tell an adversary if they were

2655
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,400
looking at it right

2656
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,679
so this idea of using controls is is

2657
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,040
coming along

2658
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,239
um if for those uh who follow the other

2659
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,960
some more of nist's publications

2660
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,239
800 171 the enhanced security

2661
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:12,560
requirements for protecting unclassified

2662
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,280
information another nist document and

2663
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,960
they are looking at using deception

2664
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,840
as a as an opportunity space for

2665
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,159
controlling our adversaries uh this is

2666
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:27,280
this is really great by the way i i i

2667
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,840
highly recommend everyone look out and

2668
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,280
look at this documentation if you go um

2669
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:34,639
if you google

2670
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,800
uh nsa deception research uh they put

2671
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,719
out um an uh a journal last year with a

2672
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:45,040
bunch of stuff in it and so you can see

2673
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,520
how nsa is starting to think about this

2674
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,599
and when nsa sort of says i think this

2675
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:52,480
is a good thing to do for for defense i

2676
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,560
think people start listening right and

2677
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,599
so i this is i think going to be

2678
02:04:57,599 --> 02:04:59,280
sort of the future

2679
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,480
uh

2680
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,960
of operations and the way we start doing

2681
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:05,440
deception so it's not just mitre who's

2682
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,760
looking at it it's not just even the

2683
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:08,960
government

2684
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,760
but um deception has got a place uh in

2685
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,480
even the gartner hype curve right and so

2686
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:21,119
gartner has been doing an analysis of um

2687
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:24,480
of of how this space works and what's

2688
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:27,040
important about it and so you can go to

2689
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,520
gartner and you can download their uh

2690
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,920
their document about applying deception

2691
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,960
technologies uh and their their idea is

2692
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:38,000
is more focused on detection and

2693
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,119
response

2694
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:43,199
uh but i think that's just the start of

2695
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:46,159
all of it it starts with detection it

2696
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,880
starts with thinking about response it's

2697
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,599
then it goes on to elicitation how do we

2698
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:53,679
make our adversaries give us more

2699
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:56,000
information about themselves uh and

2700
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
that's that's where we're where mitre is

2701
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,679
going

2702
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,440
i think the other thing is if you look

2703
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,440
out there in the community

2704
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:06,639
there's a lot going on uh there are a

2705
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:09,679
number of vendors out there who are

2706
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:13,520
selling uh deception appliances uh

2707
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,920
miter ingenuity just did an evaluation

2708
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:18,480
of a couple there are american companies

2709
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,040
there are russian companies there are uh

2710
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,599
companies across the spectrum who are

2711
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:25,040
looking at this and i'll tell you

2712
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,800
another interesting thing

2713
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,560
is um

2714
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,679
as we unders as as we talk about uh you

2715
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,760
know getting deception

2716
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,599
uh inculcated into network operations

2717
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:39,760
what you see now

2718
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,119
with a number of these uh companies is

2719
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,639
there being

2720
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:46,320
consumed

2721
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,960
for example smokescreen used to be its

2722
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,440
own company z scaler just bought

2723
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:55,199
smokescreen last year i can't remember

2724
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:58,320
what the um what the cost of that is but

2725
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,159
zeke scalar the people who are doing

2726
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:01,599
zero trust

2727
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,960
think that deception can be a value

2728
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,880
valuable proposition

2729
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:09,679
in putting together uh zero trust log on

2730
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:12,880
right uh you look up here ativo uh this

2731
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,280
one just they just got subsumed by uh

2732
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,560
another vendor a guardacore um they just

2733
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,639
got they just got uh picked up by

2734
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:22,880
another one uh and i think there's one

2735
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,800
other here that i'm not remembering who

2736
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,960
just got purchased and why is that

2737
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:27,920
important

2738
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,360
because as deception it's hard for a

2739
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,159
company to stay yay verily i just want

2740
02:07:34,159 --> 02:07:35,920
to add deception

2741
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,320
but as these deception companies are

2742
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:41,520
getting consumed into a large trapex was

2743
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:45,360
the other one they just got um

2744
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:47,840
consumed or i don't know acquired by an

2745
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,239
organization that does software as a

2746
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:52,239
service right and so what you're seeing

2747
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:55,119
here is that the companies might not buy

2748
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:58,560
deception as a uh as a tool

2749
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,639
but other companies believe that it can

2750
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:03,520
be a part of their answer and so now

2751
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:05,040
what we're seeing is this up taking

2752
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,040
where even the companies that weren't

2753
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,360
going to buy deception are going to

2754
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,920
start uh getting into the deception game

2755
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,400
and having those type of techniques

2756
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,280
employed on their network simply by

2757
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:21,280
using a bigger more well understood uh

2758
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:24,159
product offerings

2759
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:28,880
um so you know the the idea here is

2760
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,199
though that i will say that at the high

2761
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,760
level the vendors are focused on

2762
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,119
detection

2763
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:37,520
right and very few vendors and i think

2764
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,079
this is an opportunity for us

2765
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:44,400
uh i am by nature a researcher um i i've

2766
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,880
spent a lot of years right now um i used

2767
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,119
to be the um the what we call the

2768
02:08:49,119 --> 02:08:51,280
capability area leader for deception at

2769
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,840
mitre where it was my job to to build

2770
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,599
frame a framework like this put this

2771
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:58,400
framework out i transitioned that uh but

2772
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,800
now i'm i run uh our cyber uh internal

2773
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,920
research and development uh

2774
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:08,320
area and so my job is to look at all of

2775
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,880
cyber but you know what i see when i

2776
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:13,440
look across the marketplace

2777
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,679
is that the vendors are focused on

2778
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:18,639
detection everyone is terrified right

2779
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:20,800
now that they're missing something right

2780
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:23,040
this is this is where our concern is

2781
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,520
right now we're still looking just to

2782
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,840
find evidence of something on our

2783
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,280
networks

2784
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,280
few vendors are thinking about this

2785
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,679
affecting them other than just turning

2786
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:36,000
them off right other than i found this

2787
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,639
ip address that it's beginning to

2788
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:41,040
you know let's unplug that machine let's

2789
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,719
turn that machine off uh and and do st

2790
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:46,639
you know forensically analyze it or

2791
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:47,679
whatever

2792
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:50,079
uh most people are are are focused on

2793
02:09:50,079 --> 02:09:52,159
the descent on the detection piece but

2794
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:54,719
when we start thinking about affecting

2795
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,280
you know i i like to ask people

2796
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,480
so um

2797
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,800
you know someone called your company

2798
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,079
this morning

2799
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:05,920
and said this ip address is beaconing to

2800
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:08,400
the bad place wherever your particular

2801
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,639
bad place is i don't wanna i don't wanna

2802
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:11,760
you know

2803
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:13,280
everyone has their own what they think

2804
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,079
of as the bad place um

2805
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:18,320
what's your first reaction right so so

2806
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,119
many people's first reaction is

2807
02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:23,520
well go turn that machine off

2808
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,239
right so um and then in my little story

2809
02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:28,400
i go and he calls back two hours later

2810
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,880
and says i've done some digging and it's

2811
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,360
been beating out for eight months right

2812
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:34,800
and if you look at the dibber i don't

2813
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,840
know who here follows verizon's uh data

2814
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:41,199
breach uh uh investigations report i

2815
02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:43,119
think that's what it's called um they

2816
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:45,280
talk about how you know

2817
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,679
for for a lot of

2818
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:49,679
a lot of infections

2819
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:50,560
your

2820
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,079
your time to discovery can be measured

2821
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:57,840
either in days in hours to days but for

2822
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,960
a huge number of organizations

2823
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,920
it's weeks to months

2824
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,280
and so you know if you have an adversary

2825
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:10,320
that's beaconing from your machine they

2826
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,560
may have been there for months if you're

2827
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,639
able to prove that they just got there

2828
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:16,400
that's great you know

2829
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,639
prove to me that the la they didn't just

2830
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:20,079
laterally move from something that

2831
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:22,239
they've been sitting on for six months

2832
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:24,560
but what do you want to do

2833
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,880
how do you start thinking about if this

2834
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,440
has been beginning for six months

2835
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:32,239
unplugging this probably just means that

2836
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:34,400
the other places that they are on my

2837
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,679
network

2838
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:36,560
are

2839
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:38,480
are still in play

2840
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:40,960
uh hopefully they're using the same

2841
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,760
callback domains hopefully they're using

2842
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,079
the same implant on all those other

2843
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,440
machines

2844
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,760
and if they're not that can be really

2845
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,639
bad right so as researchers this is our

2846
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:54,880
place this is our chances infosec

2847
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,800
professionals to start thinking about

2848
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:59,360
how we poke at our adversaries how we

2849
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:02,159
elicit ttps from our adversaries how do

2850
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:05,440
we build things that allow us to do that

2851
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:06,719
right and so

2852
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,119
here's another big gap that i see in

2853
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:10,880
this whole area

2854
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,159
planning and analysis um you know at

2855
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:18,000
best people have white boards full of

2856
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,040
of plans and analyses and hopefully it

2857
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,360
all goes into a sim but people aren't

2858
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,520
thinking about how to plan i asked a

2859
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,119
friend of mine recently who does a lot

2860
02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:29,119
of fiction writing i said how do you

2861
02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:31,760
guys plan stories and they told me the

2862
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,199
horrible if my friend told me the

2863
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,280
horrible thing is we just use excel

2864
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,199
spreadsheet right we have characters in

2865
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:38,719
there and they have their back story

2866
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:40,719
then we make a timeline of events in

2867
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:43,119
excel and i'm like oh my god cti isn't

2868
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:45,920
any better right everyone everyone

2869
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,920
thinks that cti is about who's got a

2870
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:50,960
better uh excel spreadsheet right but

2871
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,800
where are we actually storyboarding uh

2872
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,880
what we would do with adversaries how do

2873
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:59,599
we actually start talking about it in

2874
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:02,079
planning in our thing how do we actually

2875
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:05,599
storyboard how we work our our workflows

2876
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:08,480
from planning through infosec operations

2877
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,960
rolling that analysis back in there and

2878
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,119
making sure that the planning we're

2879
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:14,000
doing

2880
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,400
is for the tools we have and the

2881
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:19,520
analysis that we're uh collecting can

2882
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,400
either drive requirements for new tools

2883
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,639
or fit into the tools we already have

2884
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,639
right and so these are important things

2885
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:29,360
um i think there's a huge opportunity

2886
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,599
for us to offer leadership in planning

2887
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,079
and analysis as infosec professionals

2888
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:36,159
and as researchers and affecting and

2889
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:38,639
elicitation or some other ones

2890
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:40,560
why does this matter right

2891
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,960
um

2892
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:45,199
why does it all matter

2893
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:48,320
because we believe that these vendors

2894
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,599
provide all significant opportunities

2895
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:54,800
um and we can and we can enable that as

2896
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,719
infosec community people we can start

2897
02:13:56,719 --> 02:13:58,400
with the the

2898
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,040
tools that they have and that lowers the

2899
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,679
barrier for them to get into it but it

2900
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:06,719
also provides those tools provide us all

2901
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:08,800
chances for the private sector and the

2902
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,480
united states government to work

2903
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,599
together at scale to actually defeat

2904
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:15,199
these bad guys and that's what mitre is

2905
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:17,679
all about is trying to find ways of

2906
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:18,960
putting our adversaries at a

2907
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,679
disadvantage

2908
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:25,280
um so i'm going to sort of uh i'm

2909
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,840
coming to closure on my slide deck

2910
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:30,560
uh you know miter miter is

2911
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,719
uh really trying to sit at that

2912
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:36,400
forefront of helping uh stop criminals

2913
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:39,119
uh help dod help the intelligence

2914
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,679
community uh do these things and the

2915
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:44,560
private sector right who owns that data

2916
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,159
miter engage is looking to find ways of

2917
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:51,599
helping everyone work together to defeat

2918
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:54,320
our adversaries and so uh if you if this

2919
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,719
sounds right to you if this sounds like

2920
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:58,239
something that you want to be involved

2921
02:14:58,239 --> 02:15:00,880
with reach out we are looking for

2922
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,639
collaboration opportunities so we have

2923
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:05,520
this idea of um you know how we're doing

2924
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,440
this what we're doing here at mitre how

2925
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,320
i grow my team is we're doing operations

2926
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,800
right so we have uh we have operations

2927
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:14,560
that we do that sometimes we share

2928
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:16,560
sometimes we don't and we have miter

2929
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,440
engage and so we're doing operations to

2930
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,840
grow and mature our talent pipeline

2931
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,560
within mitre so i'm i'm constantly

2932
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,920
trying to identify um young talent early

2933
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:31,280
career talent um and bring them into the

2934
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,159
infosec profession i think there's a lot

2935
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:37,360
of cool things we can do as infosec

2936
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:38,880
professionals right there are a lot of

2937
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,119
ninja things that we could be doing and

2938
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:43,360
i want to help mature those people

2939
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,079
we want to use engage in operations to

2940
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:48,320
lower the barrier right how do we teach

2941
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:51,520
people how to do this while being safe

2942
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,760
and we want to not only lower the

2943
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,400
barrier of entry but raise the ceiling

2944
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,360
of expertise how do we make more people

2945
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,000
more capable and put our adversaries at

2946
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,639
a greater asymmetric disadvantage

2947
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:07,280
uh and ultimately you know being a miter

2948
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:10,639
guy uh my go my goal is to evolve in

2949
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:12,960
mature uh methodologies and

2950
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,800
terminologies right i mean that's that's

2951
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,639
not something a lot of infosec people

2952
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:18,560
want to to do

2953
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,360
but it's it's sort of a miter role is to

2954
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:24,000
actually have mature standards and

2955
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,800
terminologies and ways that we can all

2956
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,679
communicate these things so that other

2957
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:32,240
people can develop uh technologies

2958
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:34,398
develop through research find

2959
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:37,439
opportunities to implant that research

2960
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,398
into uh into industry and into the

2961
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,240
government and that's um that's what

2962
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,318
we're doing here at miter

2963
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:46,080
and and i think this is also by the way

2964
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,398
my last slide i think i rushed through

2965
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:51,920
this or uh sorry about that but um i'm

2966
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,760
just gonna put out there

2967
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,840
if this sounds exciting

2968
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:58,318
if this sounds interesting send me an

2969
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:01,040
email at engage.myer.org

2970
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,959
not only do we partner with people we

2971
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:05,359
are looking to grow and mature our our

2972
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:07,920
own pipeline if you have an interest in

2973
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:10,240
coming to work at mitre we have lots of

2974
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,160

2997
02:18:06,398 --> 02:18:08,718
the end of my slides and hopefully we

02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:11,839
can get some questions

2999
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:21,840
anyone there

3000
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:25,840
whoa that's like uh

3001
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:30,000
how about that

3002
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:32,959
that is like infinite recursion right

3003
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:35,959
there

3004
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:40,160
[Laughter]

3005
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,280
okay q a we got some q a able to hear us

3006
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:45,519
uh

3007
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,280
let's see anonymous type dancer what's

3008
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,638
the difference between adversary

3009
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:52,799
engagement and continuous adversarial

3010
02:18:52,799 --> 02:18:54,080
emulation

3011
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:58,000
boy i should have a great answer for you

3012
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
and uh i'm just going to like garble my

3013
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
mic

3014
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,240
and uh and that's better than saying i

3015
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:07,120
have not heard the term but uh you have

3016
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,240
just inspired my googling so i will have

3017
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,840
uh not that's going to help you but i

3018
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,398
will have an answer uh for my next talk

3019
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:17,200
the next time you see me if i if i get

3020
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:19,200
so lucky as to have another opportunity

3021
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,599
to speak publicly i will have an answer

3022
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:22,478
for you

3023
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:23,679
um let's see

3024
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:26,478
i see mitre is a framework okay perfect

3025
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:28,799
uh should have read the second second

3026
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:31,120
comment as well does anyone have

3027
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,200
questions in the audience and if if

3028
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,200
anyone does hold on a second there is

3029
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,439
one more does mitre

3030
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:40,160
supplement

3031
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:43,280
to the diamond model does miter engage

3032
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:46,240
uh supplement to the diamond model i

3033
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:48,080
think miter engage and i talked about

3034
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,399
this uh their miter has a bunch of

3035
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:53,520
different frameworks um i would say that

3036
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:55,439
when i talk about mitre frameworks

3037
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:57,840
engage is about how we interact with our

3038
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,760
adversaries

3039
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:03,040
uh minor attack is how we document our

3040
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,399
findings

3041
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:07,920
and miter defend is how we build

3042
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,920
solutions to that

3043
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:11,120
that didn't answer your question about

3044
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,520
the diamond model but as i sort of think

3045
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:16,240
about that um engages about how you

3046
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,000
learn what's going on

3047
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,439
um and and so i think that that goes to

3048
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:23,840
understanding the infrastructure

3049
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,080
and the victimology

3050
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:28,720
and the type of technologies

3051
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:30,960
and so i think there's a lot that we can

3052
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:33,439
use to inform the diamond model

3053
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:34,960
so i think that's how i would answer

3054
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,160
that question

3055
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:37,840
hold on a second i need to put on my

3056
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,600
glasses here to read some more of these

3057
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,560
things

3058
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,479

03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:34,239
atms

3324
03:27:34,239 --> 03:27:35,920
which seems like a useful thing to know

3325
03:27:35,920 --> 03:27:38,160
how to do so please a warm summer calm

3326
03:27:38,160 --> 03:27:42,119
welcome for hector

3327
03:28:19,760 --> 03:28:22,760
okay

3328
03:28:24,479 --> 03:28:26,720
so thank you

3329
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:28,560
i'm going to talk about introduction to

3330
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:31,840
atm penetration testing

3331
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:33,920
first of all who am i

3332
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:35,600
i'm hector cuevas

3333
03:28:35,600 --> 03:28:38,080
i'm from mexico i work at bishop fox as

3334
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:40,720
a security consultant i have worked as

3335
03:28:40,720 --> 03:28:44,160
pentester in defensive side also on

3336
03:28:44,160 --> 03:28:46,640
in the defensive side i have worked as

3337
03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:48,720
forensic analyst in

3338
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:51,600
incident response also i have worked for

3339
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:54,080
a financial institution a bank a street

3340
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:55,279
hunter

3341
03:28:55,279 --> 03:28:57,200
and in all of these

3342
03:28:57,200 --> 03:29:00,880
sites offensive in the red blue purple

3343
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:04,720
teams i have worked in somehow with atms

3344
03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:06,160
so

3345
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:08,479
i have grabbed some of the knowledge on

3346
03:29:08,479 --> 03:29:11,120
all of those sites and tried to

3347
03:29:11,120 --> 03:29:13,600
learn something i have to

3348
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:14,800
develop

3349
03:29:14,800 --> 03:29:17,200
a kind of methodology because there is

3350
03:29:17,200 --> 03:29:18,880
not much information

3351
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:21,120
out there about atms

3352
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:23,600
if we look about

3353
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:25,120
atm's

3354
03:29:25,120 --> 03:29:27,040
information we're going to find

3355
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:30,160
really cool research and some advanced

3356
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:32,390
topics but when we try to

3357
03:29:32,390 --> 03:29:33,600
[Music]

3358
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:36,080
search for how to do specific things we

3359
03:29:36,080 --> 03:29:37,439
are not going to find a lot of

3360
03:29:37,439 --> 03:29:38,560
information

3361
03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:39,439
so

3362
03:29:39,439 --> 03:29:42,319
the reason exactly for this talk is

3363
03:29:42,319 --> 03:29:43,760
this because

3364
03:29:43,760 --> 03:29:46,000
i have found where i have speak with

3365
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,479
some consultants that they told me hey

3366
03:29:48,479 --> 03:29:49,520
you know

3367
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:50,720
it's a classic

3368
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:52,160
situation when they

3369
03:29:52,160 --> 03:29:54,800
uh the company say hey you are pentester

3370
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:56,720
you have been doing this

3371
03:29:56,720 --> 03:29:59,439
for several years and

3372
03:29:59,439 --> 03:30:00,640
you

3373
03:30:00,640 --> 03:30:03,120
i think that you know how to deal with

3374
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:04,479
any technology

3375
03:30:04,479 --> 03:30:06,000
uh so

3376
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,960
i have i have several uh

3377
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:12,720
sold uh an atm pen test and next week

3378
03:30:12,720 --> 03:30:15,120
it's the test so

3379
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:17,520
the pentester faces this situation and

3380
03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:20,479
then he says like hey what should i test

3381
03:30:20,479 --> 03:30:21,840
how should i do it

3382
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:24,000
what tools do i need how i'm going to

3383
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:25,520
report it so

3384
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:27,760
even what i'm looking for

3385
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:29,760
and many of the things when they look

3386
03:30:29,760 --> 03:30:31,920
for this information they are going to

3387
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:34,000
find about jackpoting and yeah

3388
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:36,640
jackpoting it's great it's the coolest

3389
03:30:36,640 --> 03:30:39,760
things uh i have done that and yeah it's

3390
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:42,720
really exciting you can wrote your own

3391
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:45,040
um code

3392
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:47,200
but at the end is that the goal of the

3393
03:30:47,200 --> 03:30:49,520
atm penetration test i'm not talking

3394
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:52,319
about hacking the team i'm not talking

3395
03:30:52,319 --> 03:30:54,640
also like in the cyber crime because i'm

3396
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,880
not talking about grabbing the money and

3397
03:30:56,880 --> 03:30:58,800
just

3398
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:01,600
i'm talking about doing a integral

3399
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:04,800
test about the atms to deliver a report

3400
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:06,720
to a financial institution

3401
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:08,880
and some of the lamest reports that i

3402
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:11,600
have seen they even say hey i just

3403
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:14,560
grabbed my usb i put kali in the

3404
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,479
in the machine and that's it i hacked

3405
03:31:16,479 --> 03:31:19,279
the atm but that doesn't mean anything

3406
03:31:19,279 --> 03:31:21,600
to to me so

3407
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:23,920
this is the reason why i'm trying to

3408
03:31:23,920 --> 03:31:26,160
give this talk and to talk about a

3409
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:28,880
little bit of the atms

3410
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:31,040
but first of all we are going to try to

3411
03:31:31,040 --> 03:31:32,239
see some

3412
03:31:32,239 --> 03:31:33,920
basic concepts about atms try to

3413
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:36,319
understand indeed we have an atm

3414
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:39,040
in the back i just saw one of those and

3415
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:40,399
we're going to

3416
03:31:40,399 --> 03:31:43,439
we're going to learn what it's this

3417
03:31:43,439 --> 03:31:47,040
so one of the basic components is that

3418
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:50,720
we have uh just a machine that we

3419
03:31:50,720 --> 03:31:53,279
it's a computer it has a computer inside

3420
03:31:53,279 --> 03:31:56,000
okay so it has the case and inside it

3421
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:57,279
has a computer

3422
03:31:57,279 --> 03:31:58,479
but

3423
03:31:58,479 --> 03:32:01,040
one of the most common uh

3424
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:03,120
conceptions out there is that all of the

3425
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:06,239
atms has windows xp so

3426
03:32:06,239 --> 03:32:09,120
that is going to depend uh

3427
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:10,720
for example

3428
03:32:10,720 --> 03:32:13,600
i'm coming from mexico and i have tested

3429
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:17,040
a lot of atms in latin america and in

3430
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:20,840
latin america is the atms are attracted

3431
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:24,000
um most common than for example here in

3432
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:25,760
the states and that's because of many

3433
03:32:25,760 --> 03:32:27,439
reasons

3434
03:32:27,439 --> 03:32:30,080
we can talk about reasons about

3435
03:32:30,080 --> 03:32:31,600
technical reasons

3436
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:33,359
security reasons

3437
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:35,520
political reasons indeed for example

3438
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:38,080
it's not the same that you attack an atm

3439
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:40,080
maybe here and

3440
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:41,520
police came

3441
03:32:41,520 --> 03:32:42,880
and then

3442
03:32:42,880 --> 03:32:45,520
maybe in mexico and in ecuador

3443
03:32:45,520 --> 03:32:47,840
police came you can deal with police

3444
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:50,399
because corruption and other stuff

3445
03:32:50,399 --> 03:32:52,239
so

3446
03:32:52,239 --> 03:32:53,840
because of that

3447
03:32:53,840 --> 03:32:57,279
atms are being attacked more common in

3448
03:32:57,279 --> 03:32:59,279
mexico in russia

3449
03:32:59,279 --> 03:33:02,080
and in brazil those are the three

3450
03:33:02,080 --> 03:33:03,760
countries that are

3451
03:33:03,760 --> 03:33:05,120
most attacked

3452
03:33:05,120 --> 03:33:07,680
and in those countries that

3453
03:33:07,680 --> 03:33:09,920
the atms are most attacked

3454
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:10,720
the

3455
03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:12,720
security is developed

3456
03:33:12,720 --> 03:33:13,600
so

3457
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:15,600
right now the windows xp is not

3458
03:33:15,600 --> 03:33:17,120
something that you're going to see

3459
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:18,479
indeed

3460
03:33:18,479 --> 03:33:20,160
the most common

3461
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:22,319
scenario that we are seeing now is that

3462
03:33:22,319 --> 03:33:24,399
we have windows 10

3463
03:33:24,399 --> 03:33:26,319
in most of the atms

3464
03:33:26,319 --> 03:33:28,800
so that's a misconception that we

3465
03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:30,840
found out there

3466
03:33:30,840 --> 03:33:33,920
but in the components that we found on

3467
03:33:33,920 --> 03:33:36,560
the atms we have the case we have a

3468
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:39,439
computer we have network equipment

3469
03:33:39,439 --> 03:33:42,239
because it needs to communicate

3470
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:44,720
we have the simple care reader

3471
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:47,200
where we are going to insert our car

3472
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:48,800
we have the cash dispenser where we are

3473
03:33:48,800 --> 03:33:50,160
going to

3474
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:52,800
grab the money and we have a safe where

3475
03:33:52,800 --> 03:33:56,399
the money is going to be stored

3476
03:33:56,399 --> 03:33:57,120
but

3477
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:59,840
we have different kind of atms and many

3478
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:02,000
of the atms have different type of

3479
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:04,000
components so

3480
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:06,560
those kind of components could be check

3481
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:08,160
scanner

3482
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:09,920
cache acceptor

3483
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:11,760
extra safeguards that depends on the

3484
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:14,720
financial institution many financial

3485
03:34:14,720 --> 03:34:16,160
institutions

3486
03:34:16,160 --> 03:34:18,479
put some extra safe words

3487
03:34:18,479 --> 03:34:20,720
that are expensive

3488
03:34:20,720 --> 03:34:22,319
but they are going to protect the

3489
03:34:22,319 --> 03:34:24,000
hardware

3490
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:26,800
we can have nfs reader

3491
03:34:26,800 --> 03:34:30,720
we have some um atms uh with vane

3492
03:34:30,720 --> 03:34:33,600
scanner for example that's

3493
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:36,640
really common in brazil

3494
03:34:36,640 --> 03:34:39,200
and we have a lot of atms with a lot of

3495
03:34:39,200 --> 03:34:41,359
components that is going to depend

3496
03:34:41,359 --> 03:34:44,800
between for example country i have seen

3497
03:34:44,800 --> 03:34:47,120
more simple atms here in the united

3498
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:49,279
states than for example in

3499
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:50,960
some other countries that

3500
03:34:50,960 --> 03:34:53,279
uh atms are going are being attacked

3501
03:34:53,279 --> 03:34:55,439
constantly

3502
03:34:55,439 --> 03:34:57,760
also we are going to divide the atms by

3503
03:34:57,760 --> 03:35:01,920
types so we have uh atms standalone

3504
03:35:01,920 --> 03:35:03,840
through wall and drive through for

3505
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:04,800
example

3506
03:35:04,800 --> 03:35:07,200
the atm that we have here

3507
03:35:07,200 --> 03:35:10,399
in the back it's an standalone so there

3508
03:35:10,399 --> 03:35:11,920
there is just

3509
03:35:11,920 --> 03:35:13,600
is this one

3510
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:17,680
uh we have just the atm and the safe is

3511
03:35:17,680 --> 03:35:19,120
down

3512
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:20,399
and

3513
03:35:20,399 --> 03:35:24,560
each of those atms can be served front

3514
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:26,720
or rear that means that when the country

3515
03:35:26,720 --> 03:35:27,920
transit

3516
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:30,399
or the an administrative

3517
03:35:30,399 --> 03:35:32,000
needs to

3518
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:34,880
do some tasks in the atm they are going

3519
03:35:34,880 --> 03:35:36,640
to open the atm

3520
03:35:36,640 --> 03:35:40,160
front or rear for example in the

3521
03:35:40,160 --> 03:35:42,399
in the banks we are going to find more

3522
03:35:42,399 --> 03:35:46,000
the through-wall atms and these

3523
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:48,880
atms are going to be served real we're

3524
03:35:48,880 --> 03:35:51,680
going to need to go through

3525
03:35:51,680 --> 03:35:53,359
a room

3526
03:35:53,359 --> 03:35:55,439
inside the financial institution

3527
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:58,720
access to that room and where they need

3528
03:35:58,720 --> 03:36:00,910
to the cash interest needs to

3529
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:02,239
[Music]

3530
03:36:02,239 --> 03:36:04,000
put the money

3531
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:05,680
through the wall

3532
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:06,560
so

3533
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:10,080
another type of um

3534
03:36:10,080 --> 03:36:13,359
we can divide the atms by another thing

3535
03:36:13,359 --> 03:36:14,880
that is between

3536
03:36:14,880 --> 03:36:17,920
network connections they can be uh least

3537
03:36:17,920 --> 03:36:21,520
online wireless and dialogue

3538
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:24,319
that is going to depend between the kind

3539
03:36:24,319 --> 03:36:27,279
of connection that they need

3540
03:36:27,279 --> 03:36:29,120
and that could be because of the

3541
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:31,680
localization for example

3542
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:35,840
if we are in a town that maybe

3543
03:36:35,840 --> 03:36:38,800
there is not really good bandwidth uh

3544
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:40,640
there is not a

3545
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:42,399
really good reception we are going to

3546
03:36:42,399 --> 03:36:44,479
have a satellite

3547
03:36:44,479 --> 03:36:46,160
connection

3548
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:49,840
and in those kinds of situations the atm

3549
03:36:49,840 --> 03:36:52,080
is not going to have really good uh

3550
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:55,680
bandwidth so if that's the case the atm

3551
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:58,640
is not going to have really good

3552
03:36:58,640 --> 03:37:01,439
connection to have another type of

3553
03:37:01,439 --> 03:37:02,399
software

3554
03:37:02,399 --> 03:37:04,640
and that means that i don't i can have

3555
03:37:04,640 --> 03:37:06,880
security for example in real time or

3556
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:09,040
monitoring in real time i can have an

3557
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:10,080
edr

3558
03:37:10,080 --> 03:37:12,720
i can have a monitoring of the journals

3559
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:14,800
and if the team is at check

3560
03:37:14,800 --> 03:37:17,520
and that happens a lot in many parts of

3561
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:19,279
the world

3562
03:37:19,279 --> 03:37:22,080
the financial institution doesn't know

3563
03:37:22,080 --> 03:37:24,560
until the cash transit came and they

3564
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:27,359
replenish the safe

3565
03:37:27,359 --> 03:37:29,439
then they

3566
03:37:29,439 --> 03:37:32,399
the the the count the counting of the of

3567
03:37:32,399 --> 03:37:34,560
the cash and they see that they miss

3568
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:37,520
money and that's the moment until the

3569
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:39,439
financial institution knows

3570
03:37:39,439 --> 03:37:41,520
that they are missing or that they will

3571
03:37:41,520 --> 03:37:43,680
attract and they are they are going to

3572
03:37:43,680 --> 03:37:44,479
trigger

3573
03:37:44,479 --> 03:37:46,640
their incident response

3574
03:37:46,640 --> 03:37:47,760
um

3575
03:37:47,760 --> 03:37:48,560
but

3576
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:50,640
that's the case because for example if

3577
03:37:50,640 --> 03:37:53,680
they are in just in a town uh they can

3578
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:55,279
have that connection because that is

3579
03:37:55,279 --> 03:37:57,840
going to be more expensive that they are

3580
03:37:57,840 --> 03:38:01,279
just attack once in a year and they know

3581
03:38:01,279 --> 03:38:04,880
and they take that risk

3582
03:38:05,200 --> 03:38:07,520
and finally we can have it but by

3583
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:10,399
functionality as i said before we have

3584
03:38:10,399 --> 03:38:13,200
different components and the atms can

3585
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:16,080
accept deposits can accept checks uh

3586
03:38:16,080 --> 03:38:19,040
kind can recycle cash and different kind

3587
03:38:19,040 --> 03:38:20,160
of things so

3588
03:38:20,160 --> 03:38:23,200
that's just like a general

3589
03:38:23,200 --> 03:38:26,960
overview of the atms how they divide uh

3590
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:28,399
how uh

3591
03:38:28,399 --> 03:38:30,720
how we can see if we

3592
03:38:30,720 --> 03:38:32,720
look in the atm of the back we are going

3593
03:38:32,720 --> 03:38:34,800
to see there is a standalone atm that

3594
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:38,000
it's going to be served up front

3595
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:39,120
and

3596
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:41,040
the

3597
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:43,680
connection i just saw a war

3598
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:46,160
that it's exposed over there

3599
03:38:46,160 --> 03:38:47,840
so

3600
03:38:47,840 --> 03:38:52,560
the current security posture of the atms

3601
03:38:52,560 --> 03:38:54,080
we're going to divide the attack

3602
03:38:54,080 --> 03:38:57,279
categories in three physical logical and

3603
03:38:57,279 --> 03:38:58,479
fro

3604
03:38:58,479 --> 03:39:01,439
in physical we're going to talk about uh

3605
03:39:01,439 --> 03:39:03,760
all those attacks that are going to

3606
03:39:03,760 --> 03:39:06,560
damage physically the atm for example a

3607
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:08,479
ram right where

3608
03:39:08,479 --> 03:39:10,239
they are going to grab a chain they are

3609
03:39:10,239 --> 03:39:12,960
going to wrap it up around the atm and

3610
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:15,920
they are going to rub it from

3611
03:39:15,920 --> 03:39:18,399
the ground and they just steal it they

3612
03:39:18,399 --> 03:39:21,920
they don't care about anything

3613
03:39:21,920 --> 03:39:24,640
as well as in with an explosive they can

3614
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:28,000
just put explosives to damage the safe

3615
03:39:28,000 --> 03:39:31,040
and they just want to access the money

3616
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:33,920
but for example if they steal the atm

3617
03:39:33,920 --> 03:39:36,080
not always is the case that they want to

3618
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:37,359
steal

3619
03:39:37,359 --> 03:39:39,359
because of the money sometimes they just

3620
03:39:39,359 --> 03:39:41,680
want to steal the atm because of the

3621
03:39:41,680 --> 03:39:43,680
computer because if they steal the

3622
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:46,560
computer they can analyze

3623
03:39:46,560 --> 03:39:50,479
what it's inside how it's configured

3624
03:39:50,479 --> 03:39:52,399
what is the multivendor that they are

3625
03:39:52,399 --> 03:39:54,000
using which is the

3626
03:39:54,000 --> 03:39:55,920
operative system that it

3627
03:39:55,920 --> 03:39:57,840
it's out there

3628
03:39:57,840 --> 03:39:59,279
which are the

3629
03:39:59,279 --> 03:40:00,800
software protections that they have if

3630
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:02,840
they have an antivirus if they have an

3631
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:05,600
edr all of those stuff

3632
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:07,840
they are going to use it because when

3633
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:10,239
they are going to prepare cyber crime is

3634
03:40:10,239 --> 03:40:12,399
going to prepare

3635
03:40:12,399 --> 03:40:15,520
an attack for that institution

3636
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:18,239
they need to know how to bypass all of

3637
03:40:18,239 --> 03:40:20,160
those controls

3638
03:40:20,160 --> 03:40:24,080
so sometimes it's really more uh

3639
03:40:24,080 --> 03:40:26,479
it's more worth to have the computer

3640
03:40:26,479 --> 03:40:28,000
than the money

3641
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,840
in the logical attacks we're going to

3642
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:32,479
have for example malware we have seen a

3643
03:40:32,479 --> 03:40:35,920
lot of examples like bluetooth

3644
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:38,160
that it's just this malware that they

3645
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:41,600
inserted via usb and the money the the

3646
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:46,560
atm just start to dispense the money um

3647
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:49,920
the malware are

3648
03:40:50,479 --> 03:40:51,199
are

3649
03:40:51,199 --> 03:40:54,080
a really different kind of my words but

3650
03:40:54,080 --> 03:40:56,800
at the end more many of them are in the

3651
03:40:56,800 --> 03:40:59,359
base the same we're going to talk about

3652
03:40:59,359 --> 03:41:00,399
that later

3653
03:41:00,399 --> 03:41:02,080
um

3654
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:04,640
and we have also in the logical uh for

3655
03:41:04,640 --> 03:41:07,279
example black box attacks uh

3656
03:41:07,279 --> 03:41:08,880
we are going to talk about also black

3657
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:11,680
box a little bit later

3658
03:41:11,680 --> 03:41:13,120
in the fraud

3659
03:41:13,120 --> 03:41:14,880
a category we have for example a

3660
03:41:14,880 --> 03:41:17,600
scheming or transaction records of roads

3661
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:21,439
this category is not um

3662
03:41:21,439 --> 03:41:23,680
it's a category where the attacks is not

3663
03:41:23,680 --> 03:41:25,760
going to be directly through the

3664
03:41:25,760 --> 03:41:27,120
to the atm

3665
03:41:27,120 --> 03:41:30,399
for example it's going to be for uh to

3666
03:41:30,399 --> 03:41:32,960
the customer for example in skimming

3667
03:41:32,960 --> 03:41:35,600
they are going to try to read to clone

3668
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:38,479
your card for for the customer and they

3669
03:41:38,479 --> 03:41:40,479
are not attacking exactly the atm they

3670
03:41:40,479 --> 03:41:41,840
are just putting something in the car

3671
03:41:41,840 --> 03:41:43,520
reader they are trying to grab the

3672
03:41:43,520 --> 03:41:45,600
information the data they are cloning

3673
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:49,040
and they are then trying to get into

3674
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:51,199
that phones in transaction reverse

3675
03:41:51,199 --> 03:41:52,640
offroads

3676
03:41:52,640 --> 03:41:55,040
they are trying to

3677
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:57,920
use it's it's a really fun attack

3678
03:41:57,920 --> 03:42:00,000
because um they are for example

3679
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:02,160
inserting a card into the atm they are

3680
03:42:02,160 --> 03:42:04,319
saying hey uh i just want to give me i

3681
03:42:04,319 --> 03:42:07,600
don't know 20 dollars uh when they are

3682
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:10,319
the atm is dispensing the 20 dollars uh

3683
03:42:10,319 --> 03:42:12,800
there are some uh things that an

3684
03:42:12,800 --> 03:42:15,439
attacker can do for example the

3685
03:42:15,439 --> 03:42:17,520
money can um

3686
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:21,840
go out of the dispenser and the

3687
03:42:21,840 --> 03:42:24,319
the between is going to be is going to

3688
03:42:24,319 --> 03:42:26,239
be there in the dispenser but if the

3689
03:42:26,239 --> 03:42:28,800
attacker doesn't grab the money

3690
03:42:28,800 --> 03:42:32,000
the atm some atms are going to uh

3691
03:42:32,000 --> 03:42:35,520
try to retrieve that dollar to the safe

3692
03:42:35,520 --> 03:42:37,520
well not to the safe to

3693
03:42:37,520 --> 03:42:39,439
the recycled bin but it's going to try

3694
03:42:39,439 --> 03:42:42,479
to retrieve that um

3695
03:42:42,479 --> 03:42:45,680
that that that that money

3696
03:42:45,680 --> 03:42:47,600
in that moment

3697
03:42:47,600 --> 03:42:50,560
the attackers can do several things they

3698
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:53,279
can for example um

3699
03:42:53,279 --> 03:42:56,319
when the atm are going to retrieve that

3700
03:42:56,319 --> 03:42:59,920
money they grab it and they just pull it

3701
03:42:59,920 --> 03:43:01,840
so the atm

3702
03:43:01,840 --> 03:43:04,880
knows that they retrieve it but indeed

3703
03:43:04,880 --> 03:43:07,439
by force the attacker just grabbed it

3704
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:11,279
so the atm just say hey something will

3705
03:43:11,279 --> 03:43:12,800
happen here i don't know what happened

3706
03:43:12,800 --> 03:43:16,800
to the money but i know that

3707
03:43:16,960 --> 03:43:17,840
i

3708
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:19,680
i guess that

3709
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:22,399
i have the money in the recycle bin and

3710
03:43:22,399 --> 03:43:25,279
as the money wasn't given to the

3711
03:43:25,279 --> 03:43:29,279
customer i should refund those to the to

3712
03:43:29,279 --> 03:43:30,399
the customer

3713
03:43:30,399 --> 03:43:31,920
so there are many

3714
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:33,439
ways to

3715
03:43:33,439 --> 03:43:35,840
play around with the money and with the

3716
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:38,160
car some atms

3717
03:43:38,160 --> 03:43:40,640
for example here is very common that the

3718
03:43:40,640 --> 03:43:44,399
car you just swipe it and that's it but

3719
03:43:44,399 --> 03:43:47,359
for example in other atms you just leave

3720
03:43:47,359 --> 03:43:50,239
the card and the atm is not going to

3721
03:43:50,239 --> 03:43:51,840
give you the car until you finish the

3722
03:43:51,840 --> 03:43:54,319
transaction and you play with all of

3723
03:43:54,319 --> 03:43:57,199
those scenarios so um

3724
03:43:57,199 --> 03:43:59,279
there is a conference that i gave in

3725
03:43:59,279 --> 03:44:01,760
devcon about all of those scenarios in

3726
03:44:01,760 --> 03:44:03,279
transaction reports of fraud if you want

3727
03:44:03,279 --> 03:44:05,439
to see uh all of those scenarios where

3728
03:44:05,439 --> 03:44:06,720
you can play with

3729
03:44:06,720 --> 03:44:08,640
all i'm not saying that you should do

3730
03:44:08,640 --> 03:44:09,439
that

3731
03:44:09,439 --> 03:44:11,920
uh but yeah i mean

3732
03:44:11,920 --> 03:44:15,600
there are a lot of uh ways that you can

3733
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:16,399
that

3734
03:44:16,399 --> 03:44:19,439
attackers can play with the cars with

3735
03:44:19,439 --> 03:44:23,199
the money and perform some frauds

3736
03:44:23,199 --> 03:44:25,199
in the atms or

3737
03:44:25,199 --> 03:44:29,680
frauds can be done to the customer

3738
03:44:29,680 --> 03:44:30,960
so

3739
03:44:30,960 --> 03:44:32,880
when i talk about which are the

3740
03:44:32,880 --> 03:44:35,520
resources uh out there

3741
03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:37,920
when when i'm not talking about research

3742
03:44:37,920 --> 03:44:39,439
of high level

3743
03:44:39,439 --> 03:44:40,239
uh

3744
03:44:40,239 --> 03:44:42,640
about atm hacking

3745
03:44:42,640 --> 03:44:45,680
i just found really

3746
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:48,239
not a lot of stuff i found that we have

3747
03:44:48,239 --> 03:44:50,160
pci for example

3748
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:53,279
pci have atm security guidelines uh you

3749
03:44:53,279 --> 03:44:54,640
can found this

3750
03:44:54,640 --> 03:44:58,239
pdf it's free it's accessible

3751
03:44:58,239 --> 03:45:02,640
nevertheless this is one of the lamest

3752
03:45:02,720 --> 03:45:04,880
pdfs that i have seen

3753
03:45:04,880 --> 03:45:06,960
i'm going to show you why

3754
03:45:06,960 --> 03:45:08,720
but we have another association for

3755
03:45:08,720 --> 03:45:12,800
example east or 80 mia

3756
03:45:12,800 --> 03:45:15,040
and all of these associations

3757
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:18,399
will require that you are part of this

3758
03:45:18,399 --> 03:45:20,960
and for being part of this you have to

3759
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:23,120
pay a fee and for paying the fee you

3760
03:45:23,120 --> 03:45:24,640
have to be part of a financial

3761
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:26,399
institution and for being part of that

3762
03:45:26,399 --> 03:45:28,319
finance institution

3763
03:45:28,319 --> 03:45:30,720
there are a lot of requirements

3764
03:45:30,720 --> 03:45:33,040
so it's not easy to access

3765
03:45:33,040 --> 03:45:35,040
into those associations

3766
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:36,560
to access that information that they

3767
03:45:36,560 --> 03:45:37,359
have

3768
03:45:37,359 --> 03:45:41,040
and i have access some of those and

3769
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:42,800
yeah they have a lot of information

3770
03:45:42,800 --> 03:45:44,800
about atms not about

3771
03:45:44,800 --> 03:45:46,720
cyber security indeed not about

3772
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:48,720
penetration tests not about

3773
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:50,880
they have a lot of information yeah but

3774
03:45:50,880 --> 03:45:53,120
it's not really good

3775
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:55,600
and the worst scenario is that it's not

3776
03:45:55,600 --> 03:45:57,680
public available and i understand why

3777
03:45:57,680 --> 03:46:00,160
because they can give it to everybody

3778
03:46:00,160 --> 03:46:01,439
but i

3779
03:46:01,439 --> 03:46:04,080
somehow i think that it's like at the

3780
03:46:04,080 --> 03:46:06,000
beginning with the scenario with windows

3781
03:46:06,000 --> 03:46:08,399
they didn't want to nobody

3782
03:46:08,399 --> 03:46:10,640
have information about there

3783
03:46:10,640 --> 03:46:13,840
and at the end we know where it leads

3784
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:16,800
also we have the vendor advisories ben

3785
03:46:16,800 --> 03:46:20,399
like devol ncr all of those and when

3786
03:46:20,399 --> 03:46:23,600
they found um a vulnerability or when

3787
03:46:23,600 --> 03:46:25,439
they are reported on vulnerability and

3788
03:46:25,439 --> 03:46:27,279
exploit or something like that they

3789
03:46:27,279 --> 03:46:30,560
report to their customers but

3790
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:33,439
there it ends they just report there and

3791
03:46:33,439 --> 03:46:35,680
it's not going to be public

3792
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:38,560
so for example this is one of the

3793
03:46:38,560 --> 03:46:42,319
examples that we have in that pdf of pci

3794
03:46:42,319 --> 03:46:44,800
where they are just going to say

3795
03:46:44,800 --> 03:46:47,199
uh how the pin pads

3796
03:46:47,199 --> 03:46:49,920
have to be placed so nobody can inspire

3797
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:50,640
you

3798
03:46:50,640 --> 03:46:52,880
or for example we have in this

3799
03:46:52,880 --> 03:46:55,438
binay

3800
03:46:55,520 --> 03:46:57,520
objective that you have to protect

3801
03:46:57,520 --> 03:46:59,680
against unauthorized remote control of

3802
03:46:59,680 --> 03:47:01,760
the application and that's it but they

3803
03:47:01,760 --> 03:47:03,120
don't tell you how

3804
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:04,560
so

3805
03:47:04,560 --> 03:47:06,239
it's not really

3806
03:47:06,239 --> 03:47:08,479
good information for you to protect the

3807
03:47:08,479 --> 03:47:10,319
atms

3808
03:47:10,319 --> 03:47:11,120
so

3809
03:47:11,120 --> 03:47:13,439
do we need more documentation yeah

3810
03:47:13,439 --> 03:47:15,520
if you are going to start a penetration

3811
03:47:15,520 --> 03:47:17,279
test

3812
03:47:17,279 --> 03:47:19,359
do we need more information there are

3813
03:47:19,359 --> 03:47:21,120
many consultants that doesn't know how

3814
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:22,800
to uh

3815
03:47:22,800 --> 03:47:25,120
perform this kind of penetration test

3816
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:29,199
indeed i found um like

3817
03:47:29,199 --> 03:47:31,439
uh one

3818
03:47:31,439 --> 03:47:33,439
uh

3819
03:47:33,439 --> 03:47:37,199
ago that this reddit uh threat that they

3820
03:47:37,199 --> 03:47:39,520
say that if it was possible to hack an

3821
03:47:39,520 --> 03:47:41,840
atm and they start to talk about

3822
03:47:41,840 --> 03:47:44,319
terminator and all of that and i was

3823
03:47:44,319 --> 03:47:45,600
like really

3824
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:47,840
it's

3825
03:47:47,840 --> 03:47:50,080
well okay

3826
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:53,120
it was really fun to to read that thread

3827
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:55,760
but yeah for example

3828
03:47:55,760 --> 03:47:57,520
i was speaking with some of the staff

3829
03:47:57,520 --> 03:48:01,439
here of summer con and they told me that

3830
03:48:01,439 --> 03:48:03,600
they did um

3831
03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:07,120
capture flag with an atm to jackpot all

3832
03:48:07,120 --> 03:48:09,199
of that stuff it's really great because

3833
03:48:09,199 --> 03:48:11,199
that is going to give you more

3834
03:48:11,199 --> 03:48:13,279
knowledge and an overview of how the

3835
03:48:13,279 --> 03:48:15,040
team is going to uh

3836
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:19,359
it works um but if we don't have that

3837
03:48:19,359 --> 03:48:21,199
those kind of

3838
03:48:21,199 --> 03:48:22,160
training

3839
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:24,720
we are not going to found anything about

3840
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:26,479
documentation

3841
03:48:26,479 --> 03:48:27,840
and at the end the cyber crime is going

3842
03:48:27,840 --> 03:48:28,640
to be

3843
03:48:28,640 --> 03:48:30,080
on the top of the mother because they

3844
03:48:30,080 --> 03:48:32,800
are going to do attack of like ram right

3845
03:48:32,800 --> 03:48:34,319
they are going to steal the atms and

3846
03:48:34,319 --> 03:48:36,720
they are going to know how the atms

3847
03:48:36,720 --> 03:48:37,600
works

3848
03:48:37,600 --> 03:48:39,840
so

3849
03:48:39,840 --> 03:48:42,080
just talk about the most common attacks

3850
03:48:42,080 --> 03:48:44,239
i have seen three attacks

3851
03:48:44,239 --> 03:48:46,399
for cyber crime first i'm going to talk

3852
03:48:46,399 --> 03:48:48,319
about cyber crime

3853
03:48:48,319 --> 03:48:50,960
it's going to be the physical access

3854
03:48:50,960 --> 03:48:52,479
as i told you

3855
03:48:52,479 --> 03:48:54,479
cyber crime is going to

3856
03:48:54,479 --> 03:48:57,120
steal atms they are going to study those

3857
03:48:57,120 --> 03:48:58,479
atms

3858
03:48:58,479 --> 03:49:00,399
by several months

3859
03:49:00,399 --> 03:49:03,680
and what they do they craft specific

3860
03:49:03,680 --> 03:49:05,199
tools

3861
03:49:05,199 --> 03:49:07,279
as you can see here for example those

3862
03:49:07,279 --> 03:49:08,640
shapes

3863
03:49:08,640 --> 03:49:10,880
these these are some tools that for

3864
03:49:10,880 --> 03:49:13,279
example in uh financial institution we

3865
03:49:13,279 --> 03:49:14,160
found

3866
03:49:14,160 --> 03:49:18,319
uh when they were robbing that that atm

3867
03:49:18,319 --> 03:49:20,880
they left these tools so

3868
03:49:20,880 --> 03:49:23,760
this shape was specifically made for

3869
03:49:23,760 --> 03:49:26,720
that atm for that specific model

3870
03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:29,359
uh so they just grabbed that tool they

3871
03:49:29,359 --> 03:49:32,960
just uh inserted and it was really easy

3872
03:49:32,960 --> 03:49:35,199
and they opened it and they just pulled

3873
03:49:35,199 --> 03:49:36,160
it

3874
03:49:36,160 --> 03:49:38,720
something that they needed as you can

3875
03:49:38,720 --> 03:49:41,279
see here even this one has a camera i

3876
03:49:41,279 --> 03:49:43,279
mean the camera that they needed to see

3877
03:49:43,279 --> 03:49:45,920
where it was the usb port

3878
03:49:45,920 --> 03:49:47,279
so

3879
03:49:47,279 --> 03:49:49,359
uh one of the most common attacks is

3880
03:49:49,359 --> 03:49:51,760
going to be physical access

3881
03:49:51,760 --> 03:49:53,359
and they are going to perf they are

3882
03:49:53,359 --> 03:49:56,960
going to make their custom tools

3883
03:49:56,960 --> 03:49:58,239
second

3884
03:49:58,239 --> 03:50:00,720
and it's

3885
03:50:01,120 --> 03:50:02,399
chained with the

3886
03:50:02,399 --> 03:50:06,640
uh previous one it's black box device

3887
03:50:06,640 --> 03:50:08,720
they are going to connect a black box

3888
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:12,000
device a black box device is just a

3889
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:13,520
computer

3890
03:50:13,520 --> 03:50:16,080
or something that they control

3891
03:50:16,080 --> 03:50:16,800
so

3892
03:50:16,800 --> 03:50:18,399
the atm

3893
03:50:18,399 --> 03:50:20,000
has a dispenser that dispenser is

3894
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:21,520
connected to the computer

3895
03:50:21,520 --> 03:50:22,479
so

3896
03:50:22,479 --> 03:50:24,399
the what they do is that they disconnect

3897
03:50:24,399 --> 03:50:26,479
the dispenser from the computer and they

3898
03:50:26,479 --> 03:50:28,880
connect the dispenser to their computer

3899
03:50:28,880 --> 03:50:31,279
and they have this computer programmed

3900
03:50:31,279 --> 03:50:32,880
to dispense money

3901
03:50:32,880 --> 03:50:34,479
uh this

3902
03:50:34,479 --> 03:50:37,040
blackboard device can be a cell phone a

3903
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:38,960
raspberry pi

3904
03:50:38,960 --> 03:50:41,120
whatever they want a laptop we have

3905
03:50:41,120 --> 03:50:43,760
phones inside the atm laptops and then

3906
03:50:43,760 --> 03:50:45,040
they just

3907
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:47,359
go to the atm and

3908
03:50:47,359 --> 03:50:49,760
put some code that they already

3909
03:50:49,760 --> 03:50:52,000
programmed and the atm started to

3910
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:54,640
dispense the money

3911
03:50:54,720 --> 03:50:55,840
so

3912
03:50:55,840 --> 03:50:57,920
the atms

3913
03:50:57,920 --> 03:50:59,840
community what they did they what did

3914
03:50:59,840 --> 03:51:00,840
they do

3915
03:51:00,840 --> 03:51:04,160
uh to

3916
03:51:04,319 --> 03:51:06,000
to prevent this

3917
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:08,800
they created like a kind of certificate

3918
03:51:08,800 --> 03:51:10,000
exchange

3919
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:12,239
between the dispenser of the computer so

3920
03:51:12,239 --> 03:51:14,239
they have a certificate in the computer

3921
03:51:14,239 --> 03:51:16,479
they have a certificate in the dispenser

3922
03:51:16,479 --> 03:51:18,160
and if this

3923
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:20,800
if the certificate doesn't match

3924
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:22,319
then

3925
03:51:22,319 --> 03:51:24,160
the dispensary will not

3926
03:51:24,160 --> 03:51:25,279
serve

3927
03:51:25,279 --> 03:51:28,640
so if we have a black box device attack

3928
03:51:28,640 --> 03:51:30,319
where the dispenser is disconnected from

3929
03:51:30,319 --> 03:51:32,319
the computer they connect it to

3930
03:51:32,319 --> 03:51:34,560
their black box device

3931
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:37,120
because this black box device doesn't

3932
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:39,840
have that certificate uh it will not

3933
03:51:39,840 --> 03:51:42,880
respond that's the theory nevertheless

3934
03:51:42,880 --> 03:51:46,560
last year we started to see

3935
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:47,920
that

3936
03:51:47,920 --> 03:51:50,960
cyber crime found a really fun way to

3937
03:51:50,960 --> 03:51:53,120
bypass this

3938
03:51:53,120 --> 03:51:54,560
it's

3939
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:55,680
it's like

3940
03:51:55,680 --> 03:51:56,170
the

3941
03:51:56,170 --> 03:51:57,600
[Music]

3942
03:51:57,600 --> 03:51:59,040
old

3943
03:51:59,040 --> 03:52:00,640
bios attack

3944
03:52:00,640 --> 03:52:03,120
when you forget about the video's

3945
03:52:03,120 --> 03:52:05,680
password and you

3946
03:52:05,680 --> 03:52:07,760
pull out the

3947
03:52:07,760 --> 03:52:11,359
the battery and you reset that the the

3948
03:52:11,359 --> 03:52:13,840
password they did something like that

3949
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:15,359
uh

3950
03:52:15,359 --> 03:52:18,080
with the dispenser they they found some

3951
03:52:18,080 --> 03:52:21,840
pins that they just uh born and

3952
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:24,399
the certificates were reset and they

3953
03:52:24,399 --> 03:52:28,560
were able to perform their attacks

3954
03:52:28,560 --> 03:52:29,920
and finally

3955
03:52:29,920 --> 03:52:32,720
the last one is going to be

3956
03:52:32,720 --> 03:52:35,760
about xfs and the malware

3957
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:39,359
but what is xfs xfs is confirmed by a

3958
03:52:39,359 --> 03:52:42,399
set of apis and spi's

3959
03:52:42,399 --> 03:52:46,160
the api just to put in an easy way it's

3960
03:52:46,160 --> 03:52:50,000
uh a way to tell xfs what we want to do

3961
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:52,239
so if we want to read a car if we want

3962
03:52:52,239 --> 03:52:54,560
to open the dispenser we want to read a

3963
03:52:54,560 --> 03:52:57,279
pin whatever we want the instruction

3964
03:52:57,279 --> 03:52:59,760
it's the easy way to tell

3965
03:52:59,760 --> 03:53:01,840
to the atm

3966
03:53:01,840 --> 03:53:05,439
all the atms have their own hardware

3967
03:53:05,439 --> 03:53:06,880
and between

3968
03:53:06,880 --> 03:53:09,839
models

3969
03:53:10,319 --> 03:53:12,479
and brands

3970
03:53:12,479 --> 03:53:15,359
all of those have their own name their

3971
03:53:15,359 --> 03:53:18,239
own codes and it's really difficult to

3972
03:53:18,239 --> 03:53:20,720
talk with each of them so

3973
03:53:20,720 --> 03:53:23,680
what they did is to create an api

3974
03:53:23,680 --> 03:53:27,439
and this api is accepts so with xfs

3975
03:53:27,439 --> 03:53:31,680
i can just put simple commands like wfs

3976
03:53:31,680 --> 03:53:37,840
startup wfs open wfs execute wfss close

3977
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:39,279
those are

3978
03:53:39,279 --> 03:53:41,600
really

3979
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:43,439
simple commands

3980
03:53:43,439 --> 03:53:46,640
where i can talk to the atm and the atm

3981
03:53:46,640 --> 03:53:48,080
will translate

3982
03:53:48,080 --> 03:53:50,800
xfs layer will translate

3983
03:53:50,800 --> 03:53:53,760
to the spi the spi are the service

3984
03:53:53,760 --> 03:53:56,080
provider interface the service provider

3985
03:53:56,080 --> 03:53:57,600
interface

3986
03:53:57,600 --> 03:54:01,840
will translate to the specific

3987
03:54:01,840 --> 03:54:05,040
dll and that dll will

3988
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:08,479
talk to the specific peripheral

3989
03:54:08,479 --> 03:54:10,560
peripheral

3990
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:13,680
to know how to deal with that

3991
03:54:13,680 --> 03:54:16,560
particular specific hardware

3992
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:19,359
so for example here we can see uh the

3993
03:54:19,359 --> 03:54:21,760
ledger of the

3994
03:54:21,760 --> 03:54:23,760
application for example that we have for

3995
03:54:23,760 --> 03:54:26,000
example that we see in the bank

3996
03:54:26,000 --> 03:54:28,720
application and that is going to be

3997
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:29,920
uh

3998
03:54:29,920 --> 03:54:31,920
that is going to talk to the middleware

3999
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:34,560
multivendor here we have for example uh

4000
03:54:34,560 --> 03:54:36,880
uptra

4001
03:54:36,880 --> 03:54:39,680
kaliknight uh all of those

4002
03:54:39,680 --> 03:54:43,040
middleweight multivendors that uh exist

4003
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:44,800
and at the end that is going to

4004
03:54:44,800 --> 03:54:48,319
translate to this spis to talk to those

4005
03:54:48,319 --> 03:54:51,840
specific dlls to talk to the hardware so

4006
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:54,319
that's the reason why

4007
03:54:54,319 --> 03:54:57,600
malware for example bluetooth

4008
03:54:57,600 --> 03:55:00,880
could talk to many of the atms now we

4009
03:55:00,880 --> 03:55:02,960
have a malware that

4010
03:55:02,960 --> 03:55:06,960
attacks dball ncr wincore and many of

4011
03:55:06,960 --> 03:55:09,040
the atms because at the end they are

4012
03:55:09,040 --> 03:55:10,720
using just an api

4013
03:55:10,720 --> 03:55:15,840
and the api is going to take care to

4014
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:16,720
be

4015
03:55:16,720 --> 03:55:18,800
multi-vendor

4016
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:20,640
so for example

4017
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:23,040
here's an example of a malware that i

4018
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:26,160
was doing a forensic analyst

4019
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:29,920
in an atm and what i did is that i i

4020
03:55:29,920 --> 03:55:31,840
didn't know what was happening to this

4021
03:55:31,840 --> 03:55:32,800
atm

4022
03:55:32,800 --> 03:55:35,439
but what i used it was

4023
03:55:35,439 --> 03:55:38,080
here you can see here you can see uh

4024
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:40,239
some of the xfs

4025
03:55:40,239 --> 03:55:41,600
commands

4026
03:55:41,600 --> 03:55:43,120
so i just

4027
03:55:43,120 --> 03:55:45,040
created a data rule

4028
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:47,600
and i say hey i just want to

4029
03:55:47,600 --> 03:55:49,600
look for those

4030
03:55:49,600 --> 03:55:52,960
executables inside atm and i want to see

4031
03:55:52,960 --> 03:55:54,479
if there are some

4032
03:55:54,479 --> 03:55:56,880
of those strings that i know that are

4033
03:55:56,880 --> 03:55:59,279
common in xfs for

4034
03:55:59,279 --> 03:56:02,479
for the malware for example op wfs open

4035
03:56:02,479 --> 03:56:06,080
wfs execute the full review start top

4036
03:56:06,080 --> 03:56:10,319
and i just uh run this java rule and i

4037
03:56:10,319 --> 03:56:11,359
found

4038
03:56:11,359 --> 03:56:13,520
here some

4039
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:15,840
matches

4040
03:56:15,840 --> 03:56:18,000
this this in this

4041
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:19,439
indeed this

4042
03:56:19,439 --> 03:56:22,000
malware

4043
03:56:22,239 --> 03:56:24,239
was found uh

4044
03:56:24,239 --> 03:56:27,359
like a year or year a half ago

4045
03:56:27,359 --> 03:56:29,600
uh was published even in crowdstrike

4046
03:56:29,600 --> 03:56:30,720
that it's

4047
03:56:30,720 --> 03:56:34,080
bluetooth is a new version of bluetooth

4048
03:56:34,080 --> 03:56:35,520
for oki

4049
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:37,199
atms

4050
03:56:37,199 --> 03:56:40,720
this malware was targeted for

4051
03:56:40,720 --> 03:56:44,880
a bank of brazil italtech

4052
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:47,760
and at the end i didn't know

4053
03:56:47,760 --> 03:56:49,600
when i was doing the forensic analysis

4054
03:56:49,600 --> 03:56:52,080
what i was looking for but as you can

4055
03:56:52,080 --> 03:56:55,199
see it was as simple as they used this

4056
03:56:55,199 --> 03:56:58,160
api so it was really simple

4057
03:56:58,160 --> 03:57:00,319
uh at the back for example you can see

4058
03:57:00,319 --> 03:57:02,800
another type of malware where is not

4059
03:57:02,800 --> 03:57:04,720
using

4060
03:57:04,720 --> 03:57:06,640
the xfs api

4061
03:57:06,640 --> 03:57:09,600
it's using for example another type

4062
03:57:09,600 --> 03:57:12,399
of attack that is for example dealer

4063
03:57:12,399 --> 03:57:13,600
loading

4064
03:57:13,600 --> 03:57:16,000
what they are doing is that that malware

4065
03:57:16,000 --> 03:57:17,520
instead of

4066
03:57:17,520 --> 03:57:20,560
using xfs and creating their

4067
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:22,000
own code

4068
03:57:22,000 --> 03:57:24,560
they just said hey i just came to the

4069
03:57:24,560 --> 03:57:27,840
atm i infect the atm and i know that

4070
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:30,720
that atm already spends money

4071
03:57:30,720 --> 03:57:31,580
with some

4072
03:57:31,580 --> 03:57:32,720
[Music]

4073
03:57:32,720 --> 03:57:35,359
dlls with some executables already

4074
03:57:35,359 --> 03:57:38,000
does that so i'm going to reuse that for

4075
03:57:38,000 --> 03:57:41,040
example this was a win called atm with

4076
03:57:41,040 --> 03:57:44,239
this csw cng

4077
03:57:44,239 --> 03:57:49,120
and that dll specific was the one that

4078
03:57:49,120 --> 03:57:51,120
is this

4079
03:57:51,120 --> 03:57:53,600
is the one in charge to dispense money

4080
03:57:53,600 --> 03:57:55,920
so the malware just

4081
03:57:55,920 --> 03:57:59,279
loaded that dll and just passed the

4082
03:57:59,279 --> 03:58:02,399
commands to the dll and the dll just

4083
03:58:02,399 --> 03:58:04,640
dispenses the money so this for example

4084
03:58:04,640 --> 03:58:06,319
are two simple ways

4085
03:58:06,319 --> 03:58:10,800
that malware works like multi-vendor in

4086
03:58:10,800 --> 03:58:12,479
atms

4087
03:58:12,479 --> 03:58:13,279
so

4088
03:58:13,279 --> 03:58:16,000
now that we have like a common um a

4089
03:58:16,000 --> 03:58:19,120
global uh

4090
03:58:20,319 --> 03:58:22,160
knowledge about atms we're going to talk

4091
03:58:22,160 --> 03:58:24,560
about some of the issues that we are

4092
03:58:24,560 --> 03:58:26,399
going to try to report or we're going to

4093
03:58:26,399 --> 03:58:28,399
try to look for when we are going to

4094
03:58:28,399 --> 03:58:29,600
where we end

4095
03:58:29,600 --> 03:58:33,359
when we are doing and penetration tests

4096
03:58:33,359 --> 03:58:36,960
so as i was saying at the beginning

4097
03:58:36,960 --> 03:58:41,920
is not that we are doing the pen test

4098
03:58:41,920 --> 03:58:45,359
because i am a penetration tester i am

4099
03:58:45,359 --> 03:58:47,680
going to do the the same i'm not going

4100
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:49,680
to use my the same tools i'm not going

4101
03:58:49,680 --> 03:58:51,920
to use for example my nmap or

4102
03:58:51,920 --> 03:58:54,399
metasploit i'm not going to fart nesus

4103
03:58:54,399 --> 03:58:56,720
because i have seen that i have seen

4104
03:58:56,720 --> 03:58:58,479
some consultants that when they are

4105
03:58:58,479 --> 03:59:00,479
going to do the penetration test to an

4106
03:59:00,479 --> 03:59:03,520
atm they say hey yeah just give me the

4107
03:59:03,520 --> 03:59:08,399
ip of the atm and they just run an scan

4108
03:59:08,399 --> 03:59:10,560
and when i'm doing a penetration test of

4109
03:59:10,560 --> 03:59:12,800
an atm the first thing is yeah i have to

4110
03:59:12,800 --> 03:59:15,439
do it on site i have to be in front of

4111
03:59:15,439 --> 03:59:16,880
the atm

4112
03:59:16,880 --> 03:59:17,840
so

4113
03:59:17,840 --> 03:59:20,319
uh one of the most famous phrases in

4114
03:59:20,319 --> 03:59:21,600
securities i

4115
03:59:21,600 --> 03:59:23,680
is that security is like an online you

4116
03:59:23,680 --> 03:59:25,279
know because of the ledgers but i don't

4117
03:59:25,279 --> 03:59:27,439
like that much we're going to see it

4118
03:59:27,439 --> 03:59:28,479
like

4119
03:59:28,479 --> 03:59:30,000
like a game

4120
03:59:30,000 --> 03:59:31,760
we have to go

4121
03:59:31,760 --> 03:59:34,000
through many layers

4122
03:59:34,000 --> 03:59:37,040
when we are trying to analyze an atm for

4123
03:59:37,040 --> 03:59:38,720
example this atm that we have in the

4124
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:39,680
back

4125
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:41,199
we are not going to go directly to the

4126
03:59:41,199 --> 03:59:43,120
atm i'm not going to connect to the atm

4127
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:45,359
to the network and just try to attack it

4128
03:59:45,359 --> 03:59:46,960
i'm going to see

4129
03:59:46,960 --> 03:59:49,520
first of all the environment where it's

4130
03:59:49,520 --> 03:59:50,800
placed

4131
03:59:50,800 --> 03:59:52,800
we are going to then see the physical

4132
03:59:52,800 --> 03:59:55,040
components of that atm

4133
03:59:55,040 --> 03:59:57,600
then i can move to the network layer and

4134
03:59:57,600 --> 03:59:59,600
finally i'm going to move to the

4135
03:59:59,600 --> 04:00:01,680
application layer so there are many

4136
04:00:01,680 --> 04:00:03,680
layers that i'm going to try to analyze

4137
04:00:03,680 --> 04:00:06,720
in the atm and not just try to

4138
04:00:06,720 --> 04:00:10,319
run a network scan and just focus in one

4139
04:00:10,319 --> 04:00:13,040
layer so i'm going to try to see

4140
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:15,120
many of the layers

4141
04:00:15,120 --> 04:00:16,800
for example

4142
04:00:16,800 --> 04:00:18,479
i'm going to try to see

4143
04:00:18,479 --> 04:00:22,640
the cctv and atm cameras and this one is

4144
04:00:22,640 --> 04:00:25,760
between the physical environment and the

4145
04:00:25,760 --> 04:00:28,000
environment where it's placed

4146
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:30,560
so if i for example

4147
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:33,840
right now here i try to attack this atm

4148
04:00:33,840 --> 04:00:34,840
i don't

4149
04:00:34,840 --> 04:00:36,399
know

4150
04:00:36,399 --> 04:00:38,479
if somebody will tell me something maybe

4151
04:00:38,479 --> 04:00:41,040
they will say ah this atm is

4152
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:44,479
because he's power of capture the flag

4153
04:00:44,479 --> 04:00:46,960
i don't know maybe if i

4154
04:00:46,960 --> 04:00:48,560
can get

4155
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:50,399
do a jackpot to this atm

4156
04:00:50,399 --> 04:00:52,560
nobody will tell me anything because i

4157
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:54,479
am in a convention

4158
04:00:54,479 --> 04:00:55,439
of

4159
04:00:55,439 --> 04:00:57,600
a lot of hackers and they will think

4160
04:00:57,600 --> 04:00:58,960
that it's

4161
04:00:58,960 --> 04:01:00,479
a part of

4162
04:01:00,479 --> 04:01:02,560
something

4163
04:01:02,560 --> 04:01:04,800
but if i can say maybe

4164
04:01:04,800 --> 04:01:07,840
there is not a camera that it's um

4165
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:10,720
recording to that atm so

4166
04:01:10,720 --> 04:01:13,840
uh many of the things that i have seen

4167
04:01:13,840 --> 04:01:16,239
or where i test is

4168
04:01:16,239 --> 04:01:18,399
try to see if there is a camera

4169
04:01:18,399 --> 04:01:21,120
that is recording the atm

4170
04:01:21,120 --> 04:01:23,199
why is that for example

4171
04:01:23,199 --> 04:01:26,080
because when we have attacks to the atm

4172
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:28,880
physical attacks when we have a scheming

4173
04:01:28,880 --> 04:01:31,520
attacks when we have transaction reverse

4174
04:01:31,520 --> 04:01:32,880
of road attacks

4175
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:35,359
the only way that we can

4176
04:01:35,359 --> 04:01:37,920
try to fund something is going to be

4177
04:01:37,920 --> 04:01:41,359
through the the records of the cctv

4178
04:01:41,359 --> 04:01:44,640
and many many times i have seen that we

4179
04:01:44,640 --> 04:01:46,479
don't have any of those

4180
04:01:46,479 --> 04:01:49,359
and the financial institution at the end

4181
04:01:49,359 --> 04:01:51,120
they are going to regret that they don't

4182
04:01:51,120 --> 04:01:53,760
have or they have it but

4183
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:54,720
the

4184
04:01:54,720 --> 04:01:56,479
camera was misplaced

4185
04:01:56,479 --> 04:01:58,399
or at that moment the camera was not

4186
04:01:58,399 --> 04:02:00,160
recording

4187
04:02:00,160 --> 04:02:02,319
so there are many scenarios and those

4188
04:02:02,319 --> 04:02:03,840
scenarios are

4189
04:02:03,840 --> 04:02:05,920
one of those that i test

4190
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:09,680
i try to see that camera is is is is

4191
04:02:09,680 --> 04:02:11,840
placed in the right direction

4192
04:02:11,840 --> 04:02:14,479
uh is it recording

4193
04:02:14,479 --> 04:02:16,880
if anything happens in that atm that i

4194
04:02:16,880 --> 04:02:18,160
am testing

4195
04:02:18,160 --> 04:02:22,239
will i have the data that i will need

4196
04:02:22,239 --> 04:02:24,399
and the other part is that many of the

4197
04:02:24,399 --> 04:02:27,120
atms have

4198
04:02:27,120 --> 04:02:28,479
the place to

4199
04:02:28,479 --> 04:02:30,960
have a camera inside of it

4200
04:02:30,960 --> 04:02:33,840
nevertheless i have found uh several

4201
04:02:33,840 --> 04:02:35,840
listeners in it

4202
04:02:35,840 --> 04:02:36,800
uh

4203
04:02:36,800 --> 04:02:38,960
i don't know maybe ninety percent of the

4204
04:02:38,960 --> 04:02:41,199
atms that i have test doesn't have a

4205
04:02:41,199 --> 04:02:43,760
camera inside

4206
04:02:43,760 --> 04:02:46,560
even when it has the place to have the

4207
04:02:46,560 --> 04:02:48,479
camera they don't have it

4208
04:02:48,479 --> 04:02:50,560
and if they have the camera it's not

4209
04:02:50,560 --> 04:02:52,000
connected

4210
04:02:52,000 --> 04:02:54,960
and if it's connected it's not recording

4211
04:02:54,960 --> 04:02:57,040
and why is that

4212
04:02:57,040 --> 04:02:58,239
because

4213
04:02:58,239 --> 04:03:00,800
if it's recording everything is

4214
04:03:00,800 --> 04:03:02,880
okay and it's recording

4215
04:03:02,880 --> 04:03:04,640
if we have a camera and it's connected

4216
04:03:04,640 --> 04:03:06,080
and it's recording

4217
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:09,120
that means that we need storage

4218
04:03:09,120 --> 04:03:11,439
and that is money

4219
04:03:11,439 --> 04:03:13,760
and the finance institution doesn't have

4220
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:15,520
one atm

4221
04:03:15,520 --> 04:03:17,040
it's going to have

4222
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:19,600
thousands of atms and that's

4223
04:03:19,600 --> 04:03:21,279
thousands of storage

4224
04:03:21,279 --> 04:03:24,479
and thousands of dollars so they

4225
04:03:24,479 --> 04:03:27,679
opted to don't have

4226
04:03:28,560 --> 04:03:29,760
at the end

4227
04:03:29,760 --> 04:03:31,760
this kind of protection

4228
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:34,800
and that is going to

4229
04:03:34,800 --> 04:03:36,560
we're going to face that when we have an

4230
04:03:36,560 --> 04:03:38,399
attack we're going we're not going to

4231
04:03:38,399 --> 04:03:39,680
have this

4232
04:03:39,680 --> 04:03:41,840
information

4233
04:03:41,840 --> 04:03:44,399
the other thing that we can see it right

4234
04:03:44,399 --> 04:03:45,199
here

4235
04:03:45,199 --> 04:03:47,120
is exposed cables

4236
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:47,840
so

4237
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:49,439
we can see

4238
04:03:49,439 --> 04:03:53,120
like here uh just the cable that someone

4239
04:03:53,120 --> 04:03:55,040
just can could

4240
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:56,239
reconnect

4241
04:03:56,239 --> 04:03:58,640
you can put something in the middle

4242
04:03:58,640 --> 04:04:01,600
for example this one is just

4243
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:03,680
the network cable

4244
04:04:03,680 --> 04:04:07,600
but this one right here is the usb cable

4245
04:04:07,600 --> 04:04:10,479
we did some tests

4246
04:04:10,479 --> 04:04:12,080
and we were

4247
04:04:12,080 --> 04:04:15,840
able to do it we put this usb cable

4248
04:04:15,840 --> 04:04:18,239
we connected a hop

4249
04:04:18,239 --> 04:04:19,199
we

4250
04:04:19,199 --> 04:04:21,279
grabbed another cable

4251
04:04:21,279 --> 04:04:22,399
we could it

4252
04:04:22,399 --> 04:04:25,359
and we connected a hop

4253
04:04:25,359 --> 04:04:26,640
so

4254
04:04:26,640 --> 04:04:28,880
we were able at the end to connect

4255
04:04:28,880 --> 04:04:34,399
through this cable a keyboard a mouse

4256
04:04:34,720 --> 04:04:35,840
usb

4257
04:04:35,840 --> 04:04:39,760
and perform from here a hit attack

4258
04:04:39,760 --> 04:04:41,439
from there we could

4259
04:04:41,439 --> 04:04:42,640
put

4260
04:04:42,640 --> 04:04:44,479
our own

4261
04:04:44,479 --> 04:04:46,319
xfs

4262
04:04:46,319 --> 04:04:48,880
binary

4263
04:04:48,880 --> 04:04:51,920
and jackpot atm

4264
04:04:52,640 --> 04:04:54,800
and one of the funniest things is that

4265
04:04:54,800 --> 04:04:55,760
here

4266
04:04:55,760 --> 04:04:56,479
we

4267
04:04:56,479 --> 04:04:57,520
access

4268
04:04:57,520 --> 04:04:59,439
the

4269
04:04:59,439 --> 04:05:02,640
cable through this space that where a

4270
04:05:02,640 --> 04:05:05,040
camera should be placed and

4271
04:05:05,040 --> 04:05:07,520
there was there were nothing

4272
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:10,319
and for example here we have an example

4273
04:05:10,319 --> 04:05:12,479
of a

4274
04:05:12,479 --> 04:05:16,479
really good uh cable that is protected

4275
04:05:16,479 --> 04:05:17,199
so

4276
04:05:17,199 --> 04:05:20,239
it's really common that when we have uh

4277
04:05:20,239 --> 04:05:23,199
some standalone atms we're going to find

4278
04:05:23,199 --> 04:05:25,680
a lot of exposed cables and sometimes we

4279
04:05:25,680 --> 04:05:27,600
don't have to cut those cables we just

4280
04:05:27,600 --> 04:05:30,000
can unplug it and just

4281
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:32,479
look into our own computers and

4282
04:05:32,479 --> 04:05:34,080
sometimes even because there is no

4283
04:05:34,080 --> 04:05:35,760
security there are no cameras nobody's

4284
04:05:35,760 --> 04:05:37,439
going to take you anything

4285
04:05:37,439 --> 04:05:38,720
so

4286
04:05:38,720 --> 04:05:42,239
it's just like a free access to atm

4287
04:05:42,239 --> 04:05:45,600
and maybe because we are in a country

4288
04:05:45,600 --> 04:05:46,800
like

4289
04:05:46,800 --> 04:05:48,560
mexico

4290
04:05:48,560 --> 04:05:50,160
police is not going to tell you anything

4291
04:05:50,160 --> 04:05:52,000
so

4292
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:53,760
i don't know

4293
04:05:53,760 --> 04:05:56,560
some random thoughts

4294
04:05:56,560 --> 04:05:59,279
also we have weak locks that's another

4295
04:05:59,279 --> 04:06:00,880
thing

4296
04:06:00,880 --> 04:06:01,840
we have

4297
04:06:01,840 --> 04:06:03,520
locks by default

4298
04:06:03,520 --> 04:06:06,399
that you just can open with a kit of

4299
04:06:06,399 --> 04:06:09,439
lock picking that you can found just

4300
04:06:09,439 --> 04:06:10,560
anywhere

4301
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:13,680
so here here i am really happy because

4302
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:16,800
we were doing the test and we at the end

4303
04:06:16,800 --> 04:06:19,120
it was really easy to open the atm

4304
04:06:19,120 --> 04:06:21,120
because it was just some

4305
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:22,960
default logs

4306
04:06:22,960 --> 04:06:25,600
we were doing some content of how

4307
04:06:25,600 --> 04:06:27,600
quickly we could open

4308
04:06:27,600 --> 04:06:29,920
and it was just a matter of seconds and

4309
04:06:29,920 --> 04:06:32,880
i'm talking about that the winner

4310
04:06:32,880 --> 04:06:35,040
was four seconds in four seconds we were

4311
04:06:35,040 --> 04:06:36,479
able to open it

4312
04:06:36,479 --> 04:06:38,720
and we were able to access

4313
04:06:38,720 --> 04:06:41,920
the save at the end the same we weren't

4314
04:06:41,920 --> 04:06:43,920
able to open it but we were able to

4315
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:46,479
access the computer and if we can access

4316
04:06:46,479 --> 04:06:49,600
the computer we can again put our binary

4317
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:52,080
of xfs and we can check all the atm and

4318
04:06:52,080 --> 04:06:55,199
we were able to do it we proved that

4319
04:06:55,199 --> 04:06:57,120
and it's really easy and another thing

4320
04:06:57,120 --> 04:06:59,760
that i didn't say about xfs is that it's

4321
04:06:59,760 --> 04:07:03,279
public available.pdf where you can found

4322
04:07:03,279 --> 04:07:04,800
the instructions

4323
04:07:04,800 --> 04:07:06,560
uh on how to

4324
04:07:06,560 --> 04:07:08,399
program so

4325
04:07:08,399 --> 04:07:10,080
you just need

4326
04:07:10,080 --> 04:07:13,600
two things to know how to control an atm

4327
04:07:13,600 --> 04:07:15,040
that is going to be the name of the

4328
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:20,040
dispenser and this is going to be the

4329
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:24,640
i don't remember the word um the

4330
04:07:24,640 --> 04:07:25,760
currency

4331
04:07:25,760 --> 04:07:27,439
you need the currency

4332
04:07:27,439 --> 04:07:29,680
that's the only things and that thing

4333
04:07:29,680 --> 04:07:32,479
you can find it inside atm in it's it's

4334
04:07:32,479 --> 04:07:34,960
going to be in the registry of the atm

4335
04:07:34,960 --> 04:07:38,000
so practically you have everything

4336
04:07:38,000 --> 04:07:41,920
if you want to control an atm

4337
04:07:44,399 --> 04:07:47,199
another thing that we check its sensor

4338
04:07:47,199 --> 04:07:49,040
sensors so we have different type of

4339
04:07:49,040 --> 04:07:51,120
sensors we have mechanical sensors we

4340
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:53,840
have um

4341
04:07:54,399 --> 04:07:57,439
laser sensors

4342
04:07:57,680 --> 04:08:00,000
and all of those kind of sensors we are

4343
04:08:00,000 --> 04:08:01,920
going to try to test it so one of the

4344
04:08:01,920 --> 04:08:04,319
most common things that we found is that

4345
04:08:04,319 --> 04:08:06,239
sensors are accessible through the

4346
04:08:06,239 --> 04:08:08,239
events of the atm

4347
04:08:08,239 --> 04:08:09,199
so

4348
04:08:09,199 --> 04:08:12,159
when we have mechanical sensors

4349
04:08:12,159 --> 04:08:12,960
that

4350
04:08:12,960 --> 04:08:13,840
they

4351
04:08:13,840 --> 04:08:17,520
trigger when you open the atm

4352
04:08:17,520 --> 04:08:18,880
because

4353
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:22,319
the sensor is not uh already pushed uh

4354
04:08:22,319 --> 04:08:23,040
well

4355
04:08:23,040 --> 04:08:26,800
the atm is going to uh notify to

4356
04:08:26,800 --> 04:08:28,080
to somewhere to the financial

4357
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:30,239
institution for example so

4358
04:08:30,239 --> 04:08:33,279
what we do here is that when we found

4359
04:08:33,279 --> 04:08:35,199
the sensor you can find it through the

4360
04:08:35,199 --> 04:08:37,040
vents with just a lamp

4361
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:38,159
uh

4362
04:08:38,159 --> 04:08:40,239
we just push it with something here you

4363
04:08:40,239 --> 04:08:43,600
can see how we just push it and when we

4364
04:08:43,600 --> 04:08:46,560
are able to open the atms

4365
04:08:46,560 --> 04:08:48,560
the sensor is going to trigger and it's

4366
04:08:48,560 --> 04:08:50,159
as simple as that we have also magnetic

4367
04:08:50,159 --> 04:08:52,800
sensors and magnetic sensors you just

4368
04:08:52,800 --> 04:08:54,960
have to put

4369
04:08:54,960 --> 04:08:56,800
a magneto

4370
04:08:56,800 --> 04:09:00,560
and it's not going to trigger

4371
04:09:00,560 --> 04:09:01,920
and

4372
04:09:01,920 --> 04:09:05,359
finally we found unprotected bias so

4373
04:09:05,359 --> 04:09:07,359
yeah at the beginning i said that many

4374
04:09:07,359 --> 04:09:09,359
of the reports are going to say about

4375
04:09:09,359 --> 04:09:10,960
this finding

4376
04:09:10,960 --> 04:09:12,960
and yeah it's a finding but it's not the

4377
04:09:12,960 --> 04:09:13,760
goal

4378
04:09:13,760 --> 04:09:14,960
if i

4379
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:16,880
just

4380
04:09:16,880 --> 04:09:19,439
boot my kali linux in the atm i'm not

4381
04:09:19,439 --> 04:09:22,479
saying that i'm hacking the atm if i put

4382
04:09:22,479 --> 04:09:25,279
doom game here i'm not hacking the atm

4383
04:09:25,279 --> 04:09:27,359
at the end yeah i i was able to do

4384
04:09:27,359 --> 04:09:29,520
something to the atm yeah and i was able

4385
04:09:29,520 --> 04:09:31,600
to do it because of something because it

4386
04:09:31,600 --> 04:09:33,199
wasn't well protected because i was able

4387
04:09:33,199 --> 04:09:36,239
to put something and that's the finding

4388
04:09:36,239 --> 04:09:38,319
that i'm going to report hey you know

4389
04:09:38,319 --> 04:09:39,840
this was not protected you have to

4390
04:09:39,840 --> 04:09:41,279
protect these

4391
04:09:41,279 --> 04:09:44,640
so somebody if was able to came to the

4392
04:09:44,640 --> 04:09:47,279
atm and opened the atm uh

4393
04:09:47,279 --> 04:09:49,680
we wouldn't be able to just plug

4394
04:09:49,680 --> 04:09:51,359
something and

4395
04:09:51,359 --> 04:09:53,279
bios is going to

4396
04:09:53,279 --> 04:09:57,120
boot that one

4397
04:09:57,120 --> 04:09:59,760
for me the one of the

4398
04:09:59,760 --> 04:10:02,159
more is the most critical finding is

4399
04:10:02,159 --> 04:10:04,479
going to be the hard drive on encrypted

4400
04:10:04,479 --> 04:10:05,359
and i

4401
04:10:05,359 --> 04:10:06,640
found

4402
04:10:06,640 --> 04:10:08,960
many times this one

4403
04:10:08,960 --> 04:10:11,199
and this one is because if i have the

4404
04:10:11,199 --> 04:10:13,600
hard drive unencrypted i

4405
04:10:13,600 --> 04:10:15,760
i am able to install malware

4406
04:10:15,760 --> 04:10:19,120
i am able to extract the passwords and

4407
04:10:19,120 --> 04:10:20,720
many of the

4408
04:10:20,720 --> 04:10:23,680
passwords and accounts in the atms

4409
04:10:23,680 --> 04:10:27,279
when they install it are by default so

4410
04:10:27,279 --> 04:10:30,319
many of the passwords when i have travel

4411
04:10:30,319 --> 04:10:32,319
around latin america i have seen that is

4412
04:10:32,319 --> 04:10:33,600
the same

4413
04:10:33,600 --> 04:10:35,760
between the same brand between ncr

4414
04:10:35,760 --> 04:10:38,560
between evil i have seen this exactly

4415
04:10:38,560 --> 04:10:40,479
the same hash when i crack it it's

4416
04:10:40,479 --> 04:10:42,960
exactly the same password

4417
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:45,760
i can disable system users i can disable

4418
04:10:45,760 --> 04:10:49,520
security software i can bypass acls one

4419
04:10:49,520 --> 04:10:51,680
of the best protections that i have seen

4420
04:10:51,680 --> 04:10:54,000
are acls but if the

4421
04:10:54,000 --> 04:10:57,040
hard drive is not encrypted i can bypass

4422
04:10:57,040 --> 04:10:59,680
acls

4423
04:11:00,479 --> 04:11:02,720
also i have seen if i go through the

4424
04:11:02,720 --> 04:11:04,239
network

4425
04:11:04,239 --> 04:11:06,720
layer that we have uh

4426
04:11:06,720 --> 04:11:09,199
unnecessary uh service exposes like for

4427
04:11:09,199 --> 04:11:10,960
example here vnc

4428
04:11:10,960 --> 04:11:11,840
so

4429
04:11:11,840 --> 04:11:15,279
you have dnc well

4430
04:11:15,680 --> 04:11:19,439
uh and if i go to the application layer

4431
04:11:19,439 --> 04:11:22,000
i can play with the

4432
04:11:22,000 --> 04:11:23,840
with application try to see if i can

4433
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:24,720
grab

4434
04:11:24,720 --> 04:11:27,680
from playing around with atm

4435
04:11:27,680 --> 04:11:30,880
cmd console and i can do that for

4436
04:11:30,880 --> 04:11:34,479
example plug in a keyboard and if i look

4437
04:11:34,479 --> 04:11:37,040
a keyboard a mouse maybe i can switch

4438
04:11:37,040 --> 04:11:40,080
between applications i can then go to uh

4439
04:11:40,080 --> 04:11:42,239
for example a help pane

4440
04:11:42,239 --> 04:11:44,800
and then from there maybe i have a link

4441
04:11:44,800 --> 04:11:46,800
that link will open internet explorer

4442
04:11:46,800 --> 04:11:48,880
from the internet explorer i will

4443
04:11:48,880 --> 04:11:50,640
for cmd

4444
04:11:50,640 --> 04:11:54,080
from cmd i have here system user one

4445
04:11:54,080 --> 04:11:56,080
funny thing that maybe you don't know is

4446
04:11:56,080 --> 04:11:57,840
that for doing a jackpot attack you

4447
04:11:57,840 --> 04:11:59,439
don't need system users you will need

4448
04:11:59,439 --> 04:12:02,960
admin user you just need regular user

4449
04:12:02,960 --> 04:12:05,198
so

4450
04:12:06,720 --> 04:12:08,960
i'm talking about security protections

4451
04:12:08,960 --> 04:12:12,560
bypass i have seen these softwares i

4452
04:12:12,560 --> 04:12:14,880
don't know if you maybe

4453
04:12:14,880 --> 04:12:16,399
recognize some of them

4454
04:12:16,399 --> 04:12:18,880
but for example checker is one of the

4455
04:12:18,880 --> 04:12:21,359
most common uh security protection

4456
04:12:21,359 --> 04:12:22,479
softwares

4457
04:12:22,479 --> 04:12:24,640
uh for atms

4458
04:12:24,640 --> 04:12:28,000
also we have likewise origin

4459
04:12:28,000 --> 04:12:30,720
and there then we have simontec endpoint

4460
04:12:30,720 --> 04:12:34,080
protection mcafee edrs stuff like that

4461
04:12:34,080 --> 04:12:36,880
but uh checker and voice origin are some

4462
04:12:36,880 --> 04:12:39,120
of the most common uh software that we

4463
04:12:39,120 --> 04:12:39,920
found

4464
04:12:39,920 --> 04:12:42,239
uh those have one

4465
04:12:42,239 --> 04:12:45,920
really good acls that prevents that you

4466
04:12:45,920 --> 04:12:46,880
install

4467
04:12:46,880 --> 04:12:49,520
software for example your your binary to

4468
04:12:49,520 --> 04:12:51,760
control xfs

4469
04:12:51,760 --> 04:12:53,439
nevertheless i can tell you that all of

4470
04:12:53,439 --> 04:12:55,279
these

4471
04:12:55,279 --> 04:12:57,680
i have been able to bypass

4472
04:12:57,680 --> 04:12:59,920
somehow because i found the

4473
04:12:59,920 --> 04:13:02,159
unencrypted hard drive and i was able to

4474
04:13:02,159 --> 04:13:04,479
modify the acl

4475
04:13:04,479 --> 04:13:05,359
or

4476
04:13:05,359 --> 04:13:07,920
at the end you have the time you found a

4477
04:13:07,920 --> 04:13:10,640
way to do it and i mean that i'm doing

4478
04:13:10,640 --> 04:13:11,760
the test

4479
04:13:11,760 --> 04:13:14,479
of three atms in one week

4480
04:13:14,479 --> 04:13:17,600
but if you go to cybercrime they

4481
04:13:17,600 --> 04:13:19,600
steal the atm and they don't have a

4482
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:22,000
limit of time they are going to do

4483
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:23,520
whatever they want they are going to

4484
04:13:23,520 --> 04:13:26,800
craft their own tools

4485
04:13:26,800 --> 04:13:28,720
and we have some hardware protections

4486
04:13:28,720 --> 04:13:30,479
for anti-slimming anti-skimming

4487
04:13:30,479 --> 04:13:32,880
anti-black box extra safe walls

4488
04:13:32,880 --> 04:13:34,960
and they installed some metal bars metal

4489
04:13:34,960 --> 04:13:37,199
pins they put some

4490
04:13:37,199 --> 04:13:38,479
vent covers

4491
04:13:38,479 --> 04:13:41,439
and those are really awesome

4492
04:13:41,439 --> 04:13:43,199
i have played with some of those i have

4493
04:13:43,199 --> 04:13:45,439
bypasses some of those but

4494
04:13:45,439 --> 04:13:47,760
on the wild i haven't seen any of those

4495
04:13:47,760 --> 04:13:51,680
because those are money and again

4496
04:13:51,680 --> 04:13:53,920
the finance institution is going to say

4497
04:13:53,920 --> 04:13:56,000
what it's best

4498
04:13:56,000 --> 04:13:57,520
to absorb that

4499
04:13:57,520 --> 04:13:59,760
incident that is going to happen i have

4500
04:13:59,760 --> 04:14:01,760
i'm going to have have three incidents

4501
04:14:01,760 --> 04:14:02,960
per year

4502
04:14:02,960 --> 04:14:05,520
or i'm going to spend a lot of money

4503
04:14:05,520 --> 04:14:10,159
that it's going to be like 50 incidents

4504
04:14:10,159 --> 04:14:12,080
and they say i'm going to absorb three

4505
04:14:12,080 --> 04:14:15,439
incidents and that's it

4506
04:14:15,840 --> 04:14:19,439
so at the end uh

4507
04:14:19,439 --> 04:14:22,239
for doing penetration tests on atms do

4508
04:14:22,239 --> 04:14:24,080
we have a methodology there is not a

4509
04:14:24,080 --> 04:14:26,399
methodology there are some

4510
04:14:26,399 --> 04:14:28,000
articles out there

4511
04:14:28,000 --> 04:14:29,520
for example for

4512
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:32,239
gp hackers

4513
04:14:32,239 --> 04:14:33,920
some of them i'm working on a

4514
04:14:33,920 --> 04:14:36,880
methodology i just put some examples

4515
04:14:36,880 --> 04:14:39,279
like the most common

4516
04:14:39,279 --> 04:14:41,760
issues out there that you can report

4517
04:14:41,760 --> 04:14:43,520
but i'm working like in a complete

4518
04:14:43,520 --> 04:14:45,680
methodology

4519
04:14:45,680 --> 04:14:47,840
that i'm going to release like in

4520
04:14:47,840 --> 04:14:49,040
format of

4521
04:14:49,040 --> 04:14:50,720
awesome

4522
04:14:50,720 --> 04:14:53,520
atm hacking or something like that

4523
04:14:53,520 --> 04:14:55,680
in github

4524
04:14:55,680 --> 04:14:57,920
like to have something that

4525
04:14:57,920 --> 04:14:59,760
you can go through

4526
04:14:59,760 --> 04:15:02,239
documentation and say hey i have to test

4527
04:15:02,239 --> 04:15:04,159
this this and this and report this and

4528
04:15:04,159 --> 04:15:06,640
this it's something that i'm just doing

4529
04:15:06,640 --> 04:15:08,800
for fun

4530
04:15:08,800 --> 04:15:10,399
and finally

4531
04:15:10,399 --> 04:15:13,119
about tooling

4532
04:15:13,600 --> 04:15:15,279
when you are going to perform a

4533
04:15:15,279 --> 04:15:16,960
penetration test

4534
04:15:16,960 --> 04:15:18,880
you have to have some tooling this is

4535
04:15:18,880 --> 04:15:21,120
some of my tools

4536
04:15:21,120 --> 04:15:24,479
that i normally use i normally

4537
04:15:24,479 --> 04:15:25,600
have to

4538
04:15:25,600 --> 04:15:27,120
grab

4539
04:15:27,120 --> 04:15:29,199
i use some lock picking

4540
04:15:29,199 --> 04:15:31,680
heat devices heat devices for me is a

4541
04:15:31,680 --> 04:15:33,120
must

4542
04:15:33,120 --> 04:15:35,760
it's the thing that gives me the

4543
04:15:35,760 --> 04:15:37,600
keys to the kingdom

4544
04:15:37,600 --> 04:15:40,880
some screwdrivers some network devices

4545
04:15:40,880 --> 04:15:43,600
whatever i need and sometimes i just

4546
04:15:43,600 --> 04:15:44,960
have found

4547
04:15:44,960 --> 04:15:48,319
some scenarios where

4548
04:15:48,319 --> 04:15:50,800
i just grab whatever i have

4549
04:15:50,800 --> 04:15:54,000
by hand so for example for example i

4550
04:15:54,000 --> 04:15:56,000
have improvised some tools with cloth

4551
04:15:56,000 --> 04:15:59,359
hangers tape cardboards magnets and i

4552
04:15:59,359 --> 04:16:02,319
have been able to open atms with that

4553
04:16:02,319 --> 04:16:04,159
for example this one

4554
04:16:04,159 --> 04:16:06,000
right here and down

4555
04:16:06,000 --> 04:16:09,439
it's just a cardboard a magnet

4556
04:16:09,439 --> 04:16:13,439
and tape and this this tool just

4557
04:16:13,439 --> 04:16:15,520
open it one atm and i'm going to show

4558
04:16:15,520 --> 04:16:17,680
you

4559
04:16:20,399 --> 04:16:23,840
this one is the cardboard i'm opening it

4560
04:16:23,840 --> 04:16:26,319
and with the magnet i'm putting the

4561
04:16:26,319 --> 04:16:29,439
magnet in the sensor to avoid to trigger

4562
04:16:29,439 --> 04:16:32,000
the alarm

4563
04:16:33,359 --> 04:16:34,960
that was it

4564
04:16:34,960 --> 04:16:37,120
it was as simple as that so

4565
04:16:37,120 --> 04:16:39,359
i didn't need anything

4566
04:16:39,359 --> 04:16:42,319
and i was in a mall

4567
04:16:42,319 --> 04:16:44,479
the cardboard i get it from there the

4568
04:16:44,479 --> 04:16:47,359
magnet i just bought a lamp

4569
04:16:47,359 --> 04:16:50,800
and that lamp have the magneto

4570
04:16:50,800 --> 04:16:52,720
and we did that

4571
04:16:52,720 --> 04:16:56,960
rule to roll them all with that it was

4572
04:16:56,960 --> 04:16:58,239
really simple

4573
04:16:58,239 --> 04:17:00,399
um

4574
04:17:00,399 --> 04:17:03,439
so at the end is jackpoting the goal

4575
04:17:03,439 --> 04:17:05,199
for me is not

4576
04:17:05,199 --> 04:17:08,560
if i want to be rich i want to be a

4577
04:17:08,560 --> 04:17:10,960
cyber crime yeah

4578
04:17:10,960 --> 04:17:12,479
for sure

4579
04:17:12,479 --> 04:17:14,560
uh i will i wouldn't be here i will be

4580
04:17:14,560 --> 04:17:16,880
in a beach

4581
04:17:16,880 --> 04:17:18,880
for sure but if i'm doing the

4582
04:17:18,880 --> 04:17:21,520
penetration test uh i have found this

4583
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:23,760
scenery and this is real i was doing a

4584
04:17:23,760 --> 04:17:26,399
penetration test externally for another

4585
04:17:26,399 --> 04:17:28,640
in another for another country

4586
04:17:28,640 --> 04:17:31,359
um indeed it was

4587
04:17:31,359 --> 04:17:33,199
uh for central america

4588
04:17:33,199 --> 04:17:37,199
and i found uh an exposed rdp

4589
04:17:37,199 --> 04:17:41,600
service i found a weak password

4590
04:17:41,600 --> 04:17:43,120
so once i

4591
04:17:43,120 --> 04:17:46,080
gain access to that computer i start my

4592
04:17:46,080 --> 04:17:48,560
normal network exploitation you know

4593
04:17:48,560 --> 04:17:52,800
it was a flat network legacy protocols

4594
04:17:52,800 --> 04:17:55,520
rapid death hashes cracked some hashes i

4595
04:17:55,520 --> 04:17:58,560
start to pick both to yeah

4596
04:17:58,560 --> 04:18:01,359
passwords in memory uh start to to do my

4597
04:18:01,359 --> 04:18:02,560
p voting

4598
04:18:02,560 --> 04:18:05,040
uh finally i located the atm network

4599
04:18:05,040 --> 04:18:07,040
because i have access because it was a

4600
04:18:07,040 --> 04:18:10,640
flat network i found an atm

4601
04:18:10,640 --> 04:18:13,600
and when i was i landed that atm i had

4602
04:18:13,600 --> 04:18:15,680
my binary that i know that it will

4603
04:18:15,680 --> 04:18:18,159
jackpot and i just did the test i asked

4604
04:18:18,159 --> 04:18:20,800
permission to that institution

4605
04:18:20,800 --> 04:18:23,840
and i don't know i just did that some

4606
04:18:23,840 --> 04:18:25,279
atm

4607
04:18:25,279 --> 04:18:28,080
in that country in central america

4608
04:18:28,080 --> 04:18:30,720
this spends 20 dollars

4609
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:34,960
i don't know where it was located i but

4610
04:18:34,960 --> 04:18:36,800
i imagine that

4611
04:18:36,800 --> 04:18:39,120
a person was walking by and hey twenty

4612
04:18:39,120 --> 04:18:40,640
dollars and

4613
04:18:40,640 --> 04:18:41,760
yeah

4614
04:18:41,760 --> 04:18:44,960
i i told that to the company and they

4615
04:18:44,960 --> 04:18:47,279
say hey yeah there's no problem because

4616
04:18:47,279 --> 04:18:49,920
balances you know

4617
04:18:49,920 --> 04:18:50,800
so

4618
04:18:50,800 --> 04:18:53,680
at the end as i told you uh we are not

4619
04:18:53,680 --> 04:18:55,920
going to focus just in the atm

4620
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:57,359
uh i

4621
04:18:57,359 --> 04:18:59,760
want to try to focus in the environment

4622
04:18:59,760 --> 04:19:02,080
where displaced atm the physical

4623
04:19:02,080 --> 04:19:04,640
components the cables the cameras the

4624
04:19:04,640 --> 04:19:06,960
logs everything

4625
04:19:06,960 --> 04:19:08,479
then i can

4626
04:19:08,479 --> 04:19:11,199
jump into the network and finally into

4627
04:19:11,199 --> 04:19:13,199
the application

4628
04:19:13,199 --> 04:19:16,319
so conclusions

4629
04:19:16,319 --> 04:19:19,199
to perform performing an atm for me it's

4630
04:19:19,199 --> 04:19:20,640
an integral test

4631
04:19:20,640 --> 04:19:23,120
it's combined all of these layers that i

4632
04:19:23,120 --> 04:19:24,960
told you

4633
04:19:24,960 --> 04:19:27,120
you have to consider all of the tools

4634
04:19:27,120 --> 04:19:28,640
that you will need

4635
04:19:28,640 --> 04:19:31,680
and you have to consider if they are

4636
04:19:31,680 --> 04:19:34,880
legit in the place that you are going

4637
04:19:34,880 --> 04:19:37,680
because for example lock picking tools

4638
04:19:37,680 --> 04:19:41,279
just the possession in mexico is illegal

4639
04:19:41,279 --> 04:19:43,040
for example

4640
04:19:43,040 --> 04:19:45,840
um

4641
04:19:46,000 --> 04:19:47,920
never mind

4642
04:19:47,920 --> 04:19:48,720
you

4643
04:19:48,720 --> 04:19:50,319
you should never perform a jackpot in

4644
04:19:50,319 --> 04:19:52,800
attack without prior authorization

4645
04:19:52,800 --> 04:19:55,600
because that's a really big deal for the

4646
04:19:55,600 --> 04:19:59,199
institutions because you because of laws

4647
04:19:59,199 --> 04:20:02,080
because of balance

4648
04:20:02,159 --> 04:20:04,159
it's not just as simple as i told you

4649
04:20:04,159 --> 04:20:06,319
that yeah money

4650
04:20:06,319 --> 04:20:07,600
nice

4651
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:09,600
it's going to it's going to involve a

4652
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:10,560
lot of

4653
04:20:10,560 --> 04:20:12,720
areas and i told you that because i

4654
04:20:12,720 --> 04:20:14,880
worked in a bank and i

4655
04:20:14,880 --> 04:20:18,720
i know all that involves

4656
04:20:18,720 --> 04:20:22,080
for me jackpot is never the goal

4657
04:20:22,080 --> 04:20:24,420
of course it's really really funny

4658
04:20:24,420 --> 04:20:26,080
[Music]

4659
04:20:26,080 --> 04:20:27,840
yeah it's something that you can do if

4660
04:20:27,840 --> 04:20:29,199
you have the authorization you can

4661
04:20:29,199 --> 04:20:30,159
review

4662
04:20:30,159 --> 04:20:32,000
um and

4663
04:20:32,000 --> 04:20:34,800
booting kali linux in an atm for me is

4664
04:20:34,800 --> 04:20:36,159
never hacking

4665
04:20:36,159 --> 04:20:39,359
itm it could be a finding yeah

4666
04:20:39,359 --> 04:20:40,640
but for me

4667
04:20:40,640 --> 04:20:42,080
finally

4668
04:20:42,080 --> 04:20:44,399
doing a successful late impenetration

4669
04:20:44,399 --> 04:20:45,359
test

4670
04:20:45,359 --> 04:20:47,120
the key is going to be communication

4671
04:20:47,120 --> 04:20:49,680
between you and between

4672
04:20:49,680 --> 04:20:50,399
the

4673
04:20:50,399 --> 04:20:52,800
financial institution why is that

4674
04:20:52,800 --> 04:20:55,279
because sometimes i have uh

4675
04:20:55,279 --> 04:20:56,800
tested an atm

4676
04:20:56,800 --> 04:20:58,880
and for example i have tested the

4677
04:20:58,880 --> 04:21:00,000
environment

4678
04:21:00,000 --> 04:21:01,520
i have seen yeah you don't have this

4679
04:21:01,520 --> 04:21:04,560
this okay perfect i jump to the physical

4680
04:21:04,560 --> 04:21:05,520
layer

4681
04:21:05,520 --> 04:21:09,279
and i see the perfect you have your

4682
04:21:09,279 --> 04:21:11,840
logs that are not by default for example

4683
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:13,279
you have tubular

4684
04:21:13,279 --> 04:21:14,159
locks

4685
04:21:14,159 --> 04:21:16,560
and i didn't bring my lock picking of

4686
04:21:16,560 --> 04:21:17,680
tubulars

4687
04:21:17,680 --> 04:21:19,279
so i can open

4688
04:21:19,279 --> 04:21:22,239
and then what should i stop i can stop

4689
04:21:22,239 --> 04:21:24,720
there so i asked the institution hey

4690
04:21:24,720 --> 04:21:26,560
please open the atm

4691
04:21:26,560 --> 04:21:28,159
and the institution sometimes they are

4692
04:21:28,159 --> 04:21:30,399
going to say hey if you

4693
04:21:30,399 --> 04:21:32,640
are asking this is because you couldn't

4694
04:21:32,640 --> 04:21:34,560
open it so i'm really good and i'm going

4695
04:21:34,560 --> 04:21:37,040
to say hey no it's just a layer it's

4696
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,439
just a part of the of the test

4697
04:21:39,439 --> 04:21:42,239
so you open it and then i found

4698
04:21:42,239 --> 04:21:44,319
inside of the atm the keys

4699
04:21:44,319 --> 04:21:46,239
then i found

4700
04:21:46,239 --> 04:21:49,199
another stuff and and i can jump into

4701
04:21:49,199 --> 04:21:51,199
another things and i can say hey you

4702
04:21:51,199 --> 04:21:53,279
have but this this this this in the

4703
04:21:53,279 --> 04:21:56,080
network you have vnc you have rdp you

4704
04:21:56,080 --> 04:21:57,680
have smb you have

4705
04:21:57,680 --> 04:21:58,880
a lot of things

4706
04:21:58,880 --> 04:22:02,159
and in the application i was able to

4707
04:22:02,159 --> 04:22:05,520
uh to bypass the kiosk i was able to

4708
04:22:05,520 --> 04:22:07,680
jump into the cmd i was able to blah

4709
04:22:07,680 --> 04:22:10,479
blah blah so at the end communication is

4710
04:22:10,479 --> 04:22:13,359
key with the institution to perform uh

4711
04:22:13,359 --> 04:22:15,120
integral tests

4712
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:18,500
and that's it thank you

4713
04:22:18,500 --> 04:22:21,690
[Applause]

4714
04:22:24,159 --> 04:22:27,479
any questions

4715
04:22:42,080 --> 04:22:45,760
okay so it's going to be uh hardware

4716
04:22:45,760 --> 04:22:48,880
first thing is

4717
04:22:51,439 --> 04:22:54,080
yeah he asked what is

4718
04:22:54,080 --> 04:22:59,479
one of the most um what was it

4719
04:23:01,040 --> 04:23:01,840
yeah

4720
04:23:01,840 --> 04:23:04,560
uh what can somebody do to make my job

4721
04:23:04,560 --> 04:23:05,760
harder

4722
04:23:05,760 --> 04:23:08,159
yeah it's going to be for example the

4723
04:23:08,159 --> 04:23:09,520
physical

4724
04:23:09,520 --> 04:23:12,159
laser if somebody uh hardened the

4725
04:23:12,159 --> 04:23:14,640
physical layer normally it's going to be

4726
04:23:14,640 --> 04:23:16,399
really really hard

4727
04:23:16,399 --> 04:23:17,840
to perform my job

4728
04:23:17,840 --> 04:23:20,399
but that is that doesn't going to stop

4729
04:23:20,399 --> 04:23:21,680
for example

4730
04:23:21,680 --> 04:23:23,760
certain parts for example it's not going

4731
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:25,279
to stop cybercrime that they are going

4732
04:23:25,279 --> 04:23:27,760
to grab the atm is not going to stop uh

4733
04:23:27,760 --> 04:23:29,920
fraud for example transaction reversal

4734
04:23:29,920 --> 04:23:31,680
fraud is not going to stop the scheming

4735
04:23:31,680 --> 04:23:35,920
is going to stop that but normally

4736
04:23:35,920 --> 04:23:38,080
starting from physical part is going to

4737
04:23:38,080 --> 04:23:41,319
be the best

4738
04:23:57,120 --> 04:23:59,199
um

4739
04:23:59,199 --> 04:24:02,720
no normally no xfs doesn't work with the

4740
04:24:02,720 --> 04:24:05,039
screen

4741
04:24:05,680 --> 04:24:09,199
it's just the components of the atm

4742
04:24:09,199 --> 04:24:11,520
more hardware specialized like dispenser

4743
04:24:11,520 --> 04:24:13,359
car reader

4744
04:24:13,359 --> 04:24:15,790
encrypted speed pin pad

4745
04:24:15,790 --> 04:24:18,479
[Music]

4746
04:24:18,479 --> 04:24:20,319
the

4747
04:24:20,319 --> 04:24:22,720
the beans

4748
04:24:22,720 --> 04:24:28,239
those are the ones that talk with xfs

4749
04:24:42,050 --> 04:24:45,208
[Applause]

4750
04:24:46,800 --> 04:24:48,880
all right that was great um

4751
04:24:48,880 --> 04:24:50,080

relentless

4753
04:24:51,359 --> 04:24:54,239
effort to stay on schedule

4754
04:24:54,239 --> 04:24:55,920
is working

4755
04:24:55,920 --> 04:24:58,560
uh we are

4756
04:25:00,159 --> 04:25:02,000
a minute and 20 seconds ahead of

4757
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,600
schedule so i think we're just gonna go

4765
04:25:19,359 --> 04:25:20,800

and does anybody remember how i present

4785
04:26:26,479 --> 04:26:29,439
with what the shortcut to position is

4786
04:26:29,439 --> 04:26:35,199
hold on yes f5 i remember f5

4787

all right

4788
04:26:54,800 --> 04:26:57,279
should we just do the uh hdmi instead of

4789
04:26:57,279 --> 04:26:58,720
yeah yeah

4790
04:26:58,720 --> 04:27:01,679
let's just do that instead

4791
04:27:07,760 --> 04:27:10,319
yeah it's on the other side

4792
04:27:10,319 --> 04:27:13,319
yep

4793
04:27:22,239 --> 04:27:25,880
hey all right

4794
04:27:27,120 --> 04:27:30,399
so hey everybody uh this is a

4795
04:27:30,399 --> 04:27:32,880
presentation on thick client uh

4796
04:27:32,880 --> 04:27:35,439
testing methodology i guess if you want

4797
04:27:35,439 --> 04:27:37,760
um so if you're coming in here today and

4798
04:27:37,760 --> 04:27:39,040
you've never

4799
04:27:39,040 --> 04:27:40,720
tested a fit client then this is kind of

4800
04:27:40,720 --> 04:27:42,239
what that's all about

4801
04:27:42,239 --> 04:27:45,040
i'm not going to do the uh

4802
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:46,880
because i don't think anybody has ever

4803
04:27:46,880 --> 04:27:48,319
done that right

4804
04:27:48,319 --> 04:27:50,399
but we'll move right past it and i think

4805
04:27:50,399 --> 04:27:53,359
we'll get through this talk together

4806
04:27:53,359 --> 04:27:54,399
uh okay

4807
04:27:54,399 --> 04:27:58,479
so my name is thomas wilson uh i am a

4808
04:27:58,479 --> 04:28:01,760
pretty good music producer i think and

4809
04:28:01,760 --> 04:28:04,640
dj uh but i also happen to be

4810
04:28:04,640 --> 04:28:07,600
a level eye level 575 paladin in final

4811
04:28:07,600 --> 04:28:09,520
fantasy 14. so

4812
04:28:09,520 --> 04:28:11,359
thank you very much uh

4813
04:28:11,359 --> 04:28:12,960
one of the one of the best games of all

4814
04:28:12,960 --> 04:28:16,080
time uh but i'm also a

4815
04:28:16,080 --> 04:28:19,439
senior security consultant at bishop fox

4816
04:28:19,439 --> 04:28:21,520
where i do sort of my hacking from time

4817
04:28:21,520 --> 04:28:22,399
to time

4818
04:28:22,399 --> 04:28:23,279
uh

4819
04:28:23,279 --> 04:28:26,000
so uh as you can see i've sort of tried

4820
04:28:26,000 --> 04:28:28,319
to get all my accolades collected here

4821
04:28:28,319 --> 04:28:30,720
uh unfortunately powerpoint had no

4822
04:28:30,720 --> 04:28:32,640
recommendations for how i should

4823
04:28:32,640 --> 04:28:36,159
structure this uh particular slide um

4824
04:28:36,159 --> 04:28:38,479
but i think it gets the job done if i'm

4825
04:28:38,479 --> 04:28:41,199
being perfectly honest

4826
04:28:41,199 --> 04:28:44,560
so uh thick clients what are they

4827
04:28:44,560 --> 04:28:46,880
everybody raise your hand if you've ever

4828
04:28:46,880 --> 04:28:49,600
used a windows computer

4829
04:28:49,600 --> 04:28:50,560
anybody

4830
04:28:50,560 --> 04:28:53,040
anybody okay yeah pretty good right uh

4831
04:28:53,040 --> 04:28:54,640
raise your hand if you've ever used any

4832
04:28:54,640 --> 04:28:57,760
computer yeah yeah wow a lot of people

4833
04:28:57,760 --> 04:28:59,359
out here who have never used computers

4834
04:28:59,359 --> 04:29:02,000
that's kind of shocking to me um yeah so

4835
04:29:02,000 --> 04:29:03,680
windows computers are kind of what a lot

4836
04:29:03,680 --> 04:29:05,520
of people think of as the place that

4837
04:29:05,520 --> 04:29:07,760
most the client tests live but there's

4838
04:29:07,760 --> 04:29:09,840
really a lot more than that

4839
04:29:09,840 --> 04:29:11,600
any thick client is basically just any

4840
04:29:11,600 --> 04:29:13,120
application that's really not your

4841
04:29:13,120 --> 04:29:14,960
browser so that's going to be something

4842
04:29:14,960 --> 04:29:17,439
that goes from the

4843
04:29:17,439 --> 04:29:19,279
machine that you're using to the

4844
04:29:19,279 --> 04:29:22,000
internet um it's the client in a client

4845
04:29:22,000 --> 04:29:23,840
server relationship

4846
04:29:23,840 --> 04:29:25,760
and often times the real difference is

4847
04:29:25,760 --> 04:29:28,080
that the thick client pre-packages all

4848
04:29:28,080 --> 04:29:30,080
of its content as opposed to retrieving

4849
04:29:30,080 --> 04:29:32,159
it from the internet where your browser

4850
04:29:32,159 --> 04:29:33,359
collects everything that it's going to

4851
04:29:33,359 --> 04:29:37,760
use more or less from online so

4852
04:29:37,760 --> 04:29:39,680
here's a little diagram to sort of

4853
04:29:39,680 --> 04:29:41,199
illustrate how

4854
04:29:41,199 --> 04:29:42,239
that

4855
04:29:42,239 --> 04:29:44,560
sort of difference works

4856
04:29:44,560 --> 04:29:46,319
on one side you can see that we've got

4857
04:29:46,319 --> 04:29:48,080
an application server uh that

4858
04:29:48,080 --> 04:29:50,560
application server to a browser client

4859
04:29:50,560 --> 04:29:52,560
is going to serve things over

4860
04:29:52,560 --> 04:29:53,439
uh

4861
04:29:53,439 --> 04:29:55,040
just all over the internet and your

4862
04:29:55,040 --> 04:29:56,880
browser does one job and it does it

4863
04:29:56,880 --> 04:29:58,880
pretty well but a thick client is going

4864
04:29:58,880 --> 04:30:00,399
to come pre-bundled when you install it

4865
04:30:00,399 --> 04:30:02,159
with a bunch of additional application

4866
04:30:02,159 --> 04:30:03,199
content

4867
04:30:03,199 --> 04:30:06,479
and you can use that in some novel ways

4868
04:30:06,479 --> 04:30:08,080
i'm going to get over the course of this

4869
04:30:08,080 --> 04:30:09,600
into a couple of different approaches

4870
04:30:09,600 --> 04:30:11,920
that you can use to test these

4871
04:30:11,920 --> 04:30:13,359
and each one of those is going to be

4872
04:30:13,359 --> 04:30:15,120
sort of a different slightly different

4873
04:30:15,120 --> 04:30:18,080
methodology with different tools um at

4874
04:30:18,080 --> 04:30:19,840
any point during this

4875
04:30:19,840 --> 04:30:21,760
once we get to the end of a section feel

4876
04:30:21,760 --> 04:30:23,040
free to ask questions once we get

4877
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:24,479
through one of the methodologies there's

4878
04:30:24,479 --> 04:30:25,760
a lot going on

4879
04:30:25,760 --> 04:30:28,080
and this talk is i think fairly

4880
04:30:28,080 --> 04:30:29,680
straightforward so we will have time for

4881
04:30:29,680 --> 04:30:32,399
a lot of questions

4882
04:30:32,560 --> 04:30:35,120
by the way interesting fun fact uh the

4883
04:30:35,120 --> 04:30:37,520
term fin client is actually what was uh

4884
04:30:37,520 --> 04:30:39,920
coined first that was for browsers

4885
04:30:39,920 --> 04:30:42,640
browsers are thin clients and of course

4886
04:30:42,640 --> 04:30:45,279
i myself like to be referred to as a

4887
04:30:45,279 --> 04:30:46,640
thin client when i do my clothes

4888
04:30:46,640 --> 04:30:48,960
shopping

4889
04:30:48,960 --> 04:30:50,479
all right so

4890
04:30:50,479 --> 04:30:51,920
thick client

4891
04:30:51,920 --> 04:30:54,080
threat model sort of methodology this is

4892
04:30:54,080 --> 04:30:56,159
really going to be if everybody is like

4893
04:30:56,159 --> 04:30:57,600
their brain has shut off instantly

4894
04:30:57,600 --> 04:30:59,359
because they're like threat model

4895
04:30:59,359 --> 04:31:01,199
like i don't want to think about that

4896
04:31:01,199 --> 04:31:02,960
side of things i'm a hacker

4897
04:31:02,960 --> 04:31:05,680
well fortunately threat models will help

4898
04:31:05,680 --> 04:31:07,279
us sort of understand these sorts of

4899
04:31:07,279 --> 04:31:10,720
approaches that we need to take to uh

4900
04:31:10,720 --> 04:31:13,520
really pinpoint certain attacks uh you

4901
04:31:13,520 --> 04:31:14,960
know there's the common thread actors

4902
04:31:14,960 --> 04:31:16,479
these are like sort of boring

4903
04:31:16,479 --> 04:31:18,960
terminology that i don't know who came

4904
04:31:18,960 --> 04:31:20,239
up with these but you know cyber

4905
04:31:20,239 --> 04:31:22,479
criminals thrill seekers ideologues

4906
04:31:22,479 --> 04:31:24,560
insiders you know whatever it's

4907
04:31:24,560 --> 04:31:26,479
everybody has a slightly different goal

4908
04:31:26,479 --> 04:31:30,159
uh i guess in many senses pen testers uh

4909
04:31:30,159 --> 04:31:32,239
you could consider us

4910
04:31:32,239 --> 04:31:34,800
modeling oftentimes all of these but in

4911
04:31:34,800 --> 04:31:36,720
inherently i guess we're thrill seekers

4912
04:31:36,720 --> 04:31:38,319
right

4913
04:31:38,319 --> 04:31:40,080
and any hacker really anybody who's out

4914
04:31:40,080 --> 04:31:41,680
there hacking i think most of us in this

4915
04:31:41,680 --> 04:31:43,439
room would consider ourselves a bit of a

4916
04:31:43,439 --> 04:31:45,279
thrill seeker

4917
04:31:45,279 --> 04:31:47,600
but we've got the three different uh

4918
04:31:47,600 --> 04:31:49,120
paths that we've got we're going to want

4919
04:31:49,120 --> 04:31:50,800
to take throughout all of this we've got

4920
04:31:50,800 --> 04:31:52,640
the client to server path

4921
04:31:52,640 --> 04:31:55,760
uh which is going to involve a lot of uh

4922
04:31:55,760 --> 04:31:58,159
abuse of the authorization that the

4923
04:31:58,159 --> 04:32:00,640
client by default has which

4924
04:32:00,640 --> 04:32:02,319
you may not even be aware of even if

4925
04:32:02,319 --> 04:32:05,120
you're logging into something

4926
04:32:05,120 --> 04:32:06,479
then on the other hand we're going to

4927
04:32:06,479 --> 04:32:09,279
take advantage of server to client um

4928
04:32:09,279 --> 04:32:10,720
which is going to be obviously the

4929
04:32:10,720 --> 04:32:12,560
reverse of that if we have access to the

4930
04:32:12,560 --> 04:32:14,319
server in some form or another we can

4931
04:32:14,319 --> 04:32:16,479
use that to compromise individual

4932
04:32:16,479 --> 04:32:18,399
clients and sort of in the middle there

4933
04:32:18,399 --> 04:32:20,560
there's the local client behavior this

4934
04:32:20,560 --> 04:32:22,960
isn't always something that you'll be

4935
04:32:22,960 --> 04:32:25,120
asked to test if you're doing this

4936
04:32:25,120 --> 04:32:27,439
either professionally or just as a

4937
04:32:27,439 --> 04:32:29,199
hobbyist way it's not something that is

4938
04:32:29,199 --> 04:32:32,000
necessarily as interesting to a lot of

4939
04:32:32,000 --> 04:32:34,080
people who want to establish risk but it

4940
04:32:34,080 --> 04:32:37,520
can be kind of cool if you need to use a

4941
04:32:37,520 --> 04:32:39,840
misconfigured thick client to break out

4942
04:32:39,840 --> 04:32:43,600
of a lower privileged environment

4943
04:32:44,239 --> 04:32:46,800
so again here with sort of our

4944
04:32:46,800 --> 04:32:49,040
application server relationship uh you

4945
04:32:49,040 --> 04:32:50,720
can see we've got our app server and

4946
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:52,720
we've got a bunch of different places um

4947
04:32:52,720 --> 04:32:54,000
between the thick client and the app

4948
04:32:54,000 --> 04:32:56,319
server is where we're gonna do our uh

4949
04:32:56,319 --> 04:32:58,720
sort of uh client server communication

4950
04:32:58,720 --> 04:33:01,279
attacks things like eye doors things

4951
04:33:01,279 --> 04:33:04,480
like authorization issues uh things like

4952
04:33:04,480 --> 04:33:07,199
stored payloads and then between the fit

4953
04:33:07,199 --> 04:33:09,039
client and the application content and

4954
04:33:09,039 --> 04:33:09,759
the

4955
04:33:09,759 --> 04:33:12,480
file system of the operating system

4956
04:33:12,480 --> 04:33:14,160
itself that's we're gonna do things like

4957
04:33:14,160 --> 04:33:17,039
privilege escalation

4958
04:33:17,039 --> 04:33:18,799
now before you do any of this

4959
04:33:18,799 --> 04:33:20,561
obviously you're going to want to have

4960
04:33:20,561 --> 04:33:22,958
an environment to do testing in

4961
04:33:22,958 --> 04:33:25,759
and just to save you a lot of trouble uh

4962
04:33:25,759 --> 04:33:26,958
if you're ever going to do any of this

4963
04:33:26,958 --> 04:33:29,278
sort of testing i really recommend using

4964
04:33:29,278 --> 04:33:30,719
a vm

4965
04:33:30,719 --> 04:33:33,039
i personally like virtualbox but i know

4966
04:33:33,039 --> 04:33:35,520
a lot of people like vmware a lot more

4967
04:33:35,520 --> 04:33:37,278
one way or another you can retrieve

4968
04:33:37,278 --> 04:33:38,958
actually interestingly

4969
04:33:38,958 --> 04:33:40,400
windows vms

4970
04:33:40,400 --> 04:33:42,639
i know i have a lot of links in here and

4971
04:33:42,639 --> 04:33:44,400
these slides i'm sure will be somewhere

4972
04:33:44,400 --> 04:33:45,680
that you can actually click on these

4973
04:33:45,680 --> 04:33:48,480
links um but you can give windows vms

4974
04:33:48,480 --> 04:33:51,359
really easily windows provides those and

4975
04:33:51,359 --> 04:33:53,599
for mac a lot of people don't know that

4976
04:33:53,599 --> 04:33:55,359
mac provides its

4977
04:33:55,359 --> 04:33:57,680
software for its operating system

4978
04:33:57,680 --> 04:33:59,039
publicly and you can actually just

4979
04:33:59,039 --> 04:34:00,639
retrieve this and run it it's a little

4980
04:34:00,639 --> 04:34:03,438
bit harder but there is a really really

4981
04:34:03,438 --> 04:34:06,480
cool push button installer uh by a user

4982
04:34:06,480 --> 04:34:08,719
called my spaghetti

4983
04:34:08,719 --> 04:34:09,438
who

4984
04:34:09,438 --> 04:34:10,879
has made it so you can just run this

4985
04:34:10,879 --> 04:34:13,039
script and download a virtual box script

4986
04:34:13,039 --> 04:34:14,958
for mac and put it in virtualbox right

4987
04:34:14,958 --> 04:34:16,639
away it's really great for testing mac

4988
04:34:16,639 --> 04:34:18,879
clients um so i really recommend you do

4989
04:34:18,879 --> 04:34:20,240
that and linux i'm sure everybody

4990
04:34:20,240 --> 04:34:21,599
already has a favorite if you've got a

4991
04:34:21,599 --> 04:34:23,039
vm that you're using that you like and

4992
04:34:23,039 --> 04:34:23,919
prefer

4993
04:34:23,919 --> 04:34:26,561
obviously just go with that um

4994
04:34:26,561 --> 04:34:28,799
also uh part of your relationship here

4995
04:34:28,799 --> 04:34:30,240
that you'll want to establish is your

4996
04:34:30,240 --> 04:34:32,400
host machine you really probably will

4997
04:34:32,400 --> 04:34:34,320
want to have burp or some other proxy

4998
04:34:34,320 --> 04:34:36,000
that you really like that

4999
04:34:36,000 --> 04:34:38,480
is kind of proxy not aware running on

5000
04:34:38,480 --> 04:34:40,719
your host machine so you can separate

5001
04:34:40,719 --> 04:34:43,759
those sorts of interactions out um from

5002
04:34:43,759 --> 04:34:46,400
the guest vm because things are going to

5003
04:34:46,400 --> 04:34:49,039
go wrong it's you know you might destroy

5004
04:34:49,039 --> 04:34:50,639
your guest vm with the way that you're

5005
04:34:50,639 --> 04:34:52,400
approaching the test

5006
04:34:52,400 --> 04:34:54,561
and obviously uh shared folders are

5007
04:34:54,561 --> 04:34:56,400
great for being able to move files from

5008
04:34:56,400 --> 04:34:58,320
your host so i really recommend that as

5009
04:34:58,320 --> 04:34:59,039
well

5010
04:34:59,039 --> 04:35:01,438
no vms uh can't do that uh client

5011
04:35:01,438 --> 04:35:03,278
doesn't want you to do testing on a vm

5012
04:35:03,278 --> 04:35:04,719
they want to send you hardware no

5013
04:35:04,719 --> 04:35:07,438
problem uh a usb device is probably the

5014
04:35:07,438 --> 04:35:08,480
best you're going to

5015
04:35:08,480 --> 04:35:10,400
get away with you may run into a

5016
04:35:10,400 --> 04:35:12,160
situation where

5017
04:35:12,160 --> 04:35:13,759
you have to

5018
04:35:13,759 --> 04:35:16,561
reinstall the operating system on your

5019
04:35:16,561 --> 04:35:20,320
computer for testing but hey that's okay

5020
04:35:20,320 --> 04:35:22,561
put it all on you know take a backup put

5021
04:35:22,561 --> 04:35:24,080
it on the usb

5022
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:27,199
hopefully it's a big usb uh but this is

5023
04:35:27,199 --> 04:35:28,639
kind of just the way i like to approach

5024
04:35:28,639 --> 04:35:31,039
these sorts of tests uh and

5025
04:35:31,039 --> 04:35:32,561
you're more than welcome to develop your

5026
04:35:32,561 --> 04:35:35,359
own approaches obviously as well i'm

5027
04:35:35,359 --> 04:35:38,719
i'm not the authority on this

5028
04:35:38,719 --> 04:35:41,438
uh also though one advantage to vms you

5029
04:35:41,438 --> 04:35:44,320
get to back up a lot of stuff it'll save

5030
04:35:44,320 --> 04:35:46,320
you a lot of hassle to have a backup

5031
04:35:46,320 --> 04:35:48,240
that you can go back to especially if

5032
04:35:48,240 --> 04:35:50,240
you're going to be configuring the fit

5033
04:35:50,240 --> 04:35:52,160
client in a bunch of different ways

5034
04:35:52,160 --> 04:35:54,400
this can be useful for like testing

5035
04:35:54,400 --> 04:35:56,799
mobile device management software uh if

5036
04:35:56,799 --> 04:35:58,160
you're going to do like

5037
04:35:58,160 --> 04:36:00,799
lockouts or resets and it's always good

5038
04:36:00,799 --> 04:36:03,199
to have a just pre-installed image to go

5039
04:36:03,199 --> 04:36:05,840
back to

5040
04:36:06,160 --> 04:36:07,919
all right so

5041
04:36:07,919 --> 04:36:09,919
finally gonna start talking about tools

5042
04:36:09,919 --> 04:36:11,680
uh i don't know if this is the most

5043
04:36:11,680 --> 04:36:14,480
exciting or more most boring part of any

5044
04:36:14,480 --> 04:36:17,438
test but i like the tools a lot

5045
04:36:17,438 --> 04:36:20,080
um so getting a good sense of what what

5046
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:21,438
you're dealing with

5047
04:36:21,438 --> 04:36:22,958
let's say you've just installed your

5048
04:36:22,958 --> 04:36:24,799
thick client application onto your

5049
04:36:24,799 --> 04:36:27,438
computer and you want to sort of figure

5050
04:36:27,438 --> 04:36:30,400
out what's different after installation

5051
04:36:30,400 --> 04:36:32,879
so one tool you can use for windows is

5052
04:36:32,879 --> 04:36:35,278
red shot this is going to allow you to

5053
04:36:35,278 --> 04:36:36,719
take a

5054
04:36:36,719 --> 04:36:39,359
snapshot of this the registry before and

5055
04:36:39,359 --> 04:36:40,879
after installation

5056
04:36:40,879 --> 04:36:43,118
that can be automatically you'll start

5057
04:36:43,118 --> 04:36:45,199
finding things you can find secrets that

5058
04:36:45,199 --> 04:36:47,359
aren't supposed to be there uh for linux

5059
04:36:47,359 --> 04:36:49,039
and mac it's a little bit different

5060
04:36:49,039 --> 04:36:51,278
because obviously the concept of the

5061
04:36:51,278 --> 04:36:53,759
registry doesn't exist and they're very

5062
04:36:53,759 --> 04:36:55,919
similar uh to each other but very

5063
04:36:55,919 --> 04:36:57,759
different from windows one thing that

5064
04:36:57,759 --> 04:37:01,118
you can use is pspy or ps pi i think

5065
04:37:01,118 --> 04:37:04,080
it's piece by like process spy um which

5066
04:37:04,080 --> 04:37:06,080
i'll show you a little bit of in this i

5067
04:37:06,080 --> 04:37:08,400
have a few screenshots and another thing

5068
04:37:08,400 --> 04:37:10,799
that you can just use is find here is a

5069
04:37:10,799 --> 04:37:12,799
find command that will let you monitor

5070
04:37:12,799 --> 04:37:15,039
all of the changed files

5071
04:37:15,039 --> 04:37:17,438
in any given directory it's that's a

5072
04:37:17,438 --> 04:37:20,160
little bit of a basic approach piece

5073
04:37:20,160 --> 04:37:22,240
piece by is a little bit more useful but

5074
04:37:22,240 --> 04:37:25,520
it can get you a lot of information

5075
04:37:25,520 --> 04:37:27,359
also explorer suite

5076
04:37:27,359 --> 04:37:29,118
or a cff explorer if you don't want to

5077
04:37:29,118 --> 04:37:30,561
pay money and you only need to test

5078
04:37:30,561 --> 04:37:33,359
windows is great for just kind of a

5079
04:37:33,359 --> 04:37:35,359
little bit of

5080
04:37:35,359 --> 04:37:38,958
evaluation of what the binary is doing

5081
04:37:38,958 --> 04:37:40,400
and of course other things that you want

5082
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:41,840
to do

5083
04:37:41,840 --> 04:37:44,080
take note of all the directories for the

5084
04:37:44,080 --> 04:37:46,240
installation look to see where things

5085
04:37:46,240 --> 04:37:47,759
are changing you're going to want to go

5086
04:37:47,759 --> 04:37:50,160
back there during the test

5087
04:37:50,160 --> 04:37:53,278
take a look at files that get changed

5088
04:37:53,278 --> 04:37:54,799
in particular that are owned by the

5089
04:37:54,799 --> 04:37:56,799
system or route

5090
04:37:56,799 --> 04:37:58,320
obviously look for those registry

5091
04:37:58,320 --> 04:37:59,520
entries

5092
04:37:59,520 --> 04:38:00,958
and environment variables that get

5093
04:38:00,958 --> 04:38:02,958
created that have credentials

5094
04:38:02,958 --> 04:38:05,199
and look for any scripts that come

5095
04:38:05,199 --> 04:38:07,520
packaged with the application scripts

5096
04:38:07,520 --> 04:38:09,759
are a great way to get local privilege

5097
04:38:09,759 --> 04:38:11,680
escalation but they can also be a great

5098
04:38:11,680 --> 04:38:13,599
way to immediately identify

5099
04:38:13,599 --> 04:38:18,239
vulnerabilities in a back-end server

5100
04:38:18,480 --> 04:38:19,359
so

5101
04:38:19,359 --> 04:38:20,719
i'm just going to show you a couple of

5102
04:38:20,719 --> 04:38:22,719
what these tools look like

5103
04:38:22,719 --> 04:38:24,719
i know using a lot of new tools all at

5104
04:38:24,719 --> 04:38:26,240
once is kind of

5105
04:38:26,240 --> 04:38:28,799
it takes some adaptation but just so

5106
04:38:28,799 --> 04:38:30,320
that they don't seem too scary you may

5107
04:38:30,320 --> 04:38:32,480
have seen a lot of these before um

5108
04:38:32,480 --> 04:38:34,080
especially obviously if you do thick

5109
04:38:34,080 --> 04:38:35,919
line testing um

5110
04:38:35,919 --> 04:38:38,799
but uh here's the ff explorer

5111
04:38:38,799 --> 04:38:40,480
this is the free version that works for

5112
04:38:40,480 --> 04:38:42,958
windows it'll really quickly allow you

5113
04:38:42,958 --> 04:38:44,400
to figure out um

5114
04:38:44,400 --> 04:38:46,240
sort of the structure of the binary the

5115
04:38:46,240 --> 04:38:47,840
type of file that it is the language

5116
04:38:47,840 --> 04:38:49,359
that it was written in all sorts of good

5117
04:38:49,359 --> 04:38:50,879
stuff that you might want

5118
04:38:50,879 --> 04:38:53,759
dlls it does very very similar things

5119
04:38:53,759 --> 04:38:55,759
for other applications

5120
04:38:55,759 --> 04:38:58,160
if you get explorer suite for

5121
04:38:58,160 --> 04:39:01,359
linux and mac

5122
04:39:01,359 --> 04:39:04,561
here's red shot for windows

5123
04:39:04,561 --> 04:39:07,359
super easy to use you just say hey take

5124
04:39:07,359 --> 04:39:10,240
a snapshot now install your application

5125
04:39:10,240 --> 04:39:12,400
take us take a second snapshot and

5126
04:39:12,400 --> 04:39:14,400
compare and then you get a list of all

5127
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:16,320
of the keys that have been added that's

5128
04:39:16,320 --> 04:39:18,400
super nice just open up the registry go

5129
04:39:18,400 --> 04:39:20,561
to them see what they are

5130
04:39:20,561 --> 04:39:22,080
yeah it's a

5131
04:39:22,080 --> 04:39:23,840
it's a great place to start looking for

5132
04:39:23,840 --> 04:39:25,919
things to attack um

5133
04:39:25,919 --> 04:39:27,599
a lot of findings come straight from the

5134
04:39:27,599 --> 04:39:30,080
registry in windows uh that could be a

5135
04:39:30,080 --> 04:39:32,719
url that they that the creator of the

5136
04:39:32,719 --> 04:39:34,240
binary doesn't want you to know about

5137
04:39:34,240 --> 04:39:36,639
you know so security through obscurity

5138
04:39:36,639 --> 04:39:38,320
it could be user names that are being

5139
04:39:38,320 --> 04:39:41,040
used for authentication on the back end

5140
04:39:41,040 --> 04:39:43,200
and it could be ip addresses uh all

5141
04:39:43,200 --> 04:39:44,718
sorts of things there's really a lot

5142
04:39:44,718 --> 04:39:46,798
that can be done in there go ahead and

5143
04:39:46,798 --> 04:39:48,400
double double-click those

5144
04:39:48,400 --> 04:39:50,320
or right-click and modify do whatever

5145
04:39:50,320 --> 04:39:52,000
you want with it that's a great place to

5146
04:39:52,000 --> 04:39:54,240
start

5147
04:39:54,320 --> 04:39:56,638
on the mac and linux side we've got

5148
04:39:56,638 --> 04:39:58,160
p-spy

5149
04:39:58,160 --> 04:40:00,718
a great tester over at bishop fox

5150
04:40:00,718 --> 04:40:02,718
zoe uh

5151
04:40:02,718 --> 04:40:04,798
allowed me to figure out how to use this

5152
04:40:04,798 --> 04:40:06,798
she helped me figure out how to use this

5153
04:40:06,798 --> 04:40:09,920
and piece by is great it allows you to

5154
04:40:09,920 --> 04:40:12,000
see where all of the files

5155
04:40:12,000 --> 04:40:14,160
file system changes are being done from

5156
04:40:14,160 --> 04:40:17,840
any directory um that can be file reads

5157
04:40:17,840 --> 04:40:20,000
file rights at any point that's really

5158
04:40:20,000 --> 04:40:22,320
useful in some ways it's more potent

5159
04:40:22,320 --> 04:40:23,120
than

5160
04:40:23,120 --> 04:40:24,560
the equivalent tools that we have on

5161
04:40:24,560 --> 04:40:26,798
windows but in other ways it's slightly

5162
04:40:26,798 --> 04:40:28,560
less helpful

5163
04:40:28,560 --> 04:40:30,798
you know it's a it's a matter of taste

5164
04:40:30,798 --> 04:40:32,878
but that's what you got on uh there may

5165
04:40:32,878 --> 04:40:34,240
be other tools but that's what you got

5166
04:40:34,240 --> 04:40:36,718
for the most part on uh on mac and linux

5167
04:40:36,718 --> 04:40:38,560
other than find

5168
04:40:38,560 --> 04:40:40,160
all right so

5169
04:40:40,160 --> 04:40:41,600
client to server time let's start

5170
04:40:41,600 --> 04:40:42,718
talking about some of these actual

5171
04:40:42,718 --> 04:40:44,718
attack paths we've kind of gotten a

5172
04:40:44,718 --> 04:40:46,160
little bit into some of them but let's

5173
04:40:46,160 --> 04:40:49,120
get a little bit more in depth

5174
04:40:49,120 --> 04:40:50,718
uh so yeah

5175
04:40:50,718 --> 04:40:52,080
starting out you're going to notice that

5176
04:40:52,080 --> 04:40:54,080
this is a lot like a standard web

5177
04:40:54,080 --> 04:40:55,680
application test

5178
04:40:55,680 --> 04:40:57,440
hacking a web app and hacking a thick

5179
04:40:57,440 --> 04:40:59,200
client are really

5180
04:40:59,200 --> 04:41:01,440
quite similar right

5181
04:41:01,440 --> 04:41:02,638
burp is something that you're going to

5182
04:41:02,638 --> 04:41:04,240
want to use if

5183
04:41:04,240 --> 04:41:05,600
i know a lot of people are already

5184
04:41:05,600 --> 04:41:07,680
familiar with burp and it works very

5185
04:41:07,680 --> 04:41:10,958
very well for binaries

5186
04:41:10,958 --> 04:41:13,200
and especially it works well for proxy

5187
04:41:13,200 --> 04:41:15,440
aware clients but it's an all-arounder

5188
04:41:15,440 --> 04:41:17,600
and you can make it operate in invisible

5189
04:41:17,600 --> 04:41:19,760
mode i'll show you how to do that uh but

5190
04:41:19,760 --> 04:41:21,840
yeah it's it's very great i just install

5191
04:41:21,840 --> 04:41:23,760
your certificates and it goes great

5192
04:41:23,760 --> 04:41:24,798
fiddler

5193
04:41:24,798 --> 04:41:27,440
also is a similar tool

5194
04:41:27,440 --> 04:41:29,360
that instead of working

5195
04:41:29,360 --> 04:41:31,920
at the external level instead of needing

5196
04:41:31,920 --> 04:41:33,680
clients to be proxy aware

5197
04:41:33,680 --> 04:41:35,920
it injects itself into

5198
04:41:35,920 --> 04:41:39,120
lower level dlls and allows you to do

5199
04:41:39,120 --> 04:41:40,718
bypass do things like bypass cert

5200
04:41:40,718 --> 04:41:42,638
pinning without having to modify

5201
04:41:42,638 --> 04:41:45,040
binaries or anything like that um there

5202
04:41:45,040 --> 04:41:47,280
are also fiddler has a suite that's paid

5203
04:41:47,280 --> 04:41:49,360
that's for mac and linux as well but

5204
04:41:49,360 --> 04:41:51,120
it's free on windows

5205
04:41:51,120 --> 04:41:53,120
and yeah it's super useful also

5206
04:41:53,120 --> 04:41:55,440
wireshark it's a classic and it's good

5207
04:41:55,440 --> 04:41:57,760
for looking at non-encrypted http

5208
04:41:57,760 --> 04:42:00,080
traffic and just for figuring out what

5209
04:42:00,080 --> 04:42:02,000
ip addresses you might be talking to

5210
04:42:02,000 --> 04:42:04,718
that sort of thing

5211
04:42:04,878 --> 04:42:06,400
you got a couple more options i'm not

5212
04:42:06,400 --> 04:42:08,000
going to overload you with these but

5213
04:42:08,000 --> 04:42:11,440
mallory is an okay but unmaintained

5214
04:42:11,440 --> 04:42:14,320
websocket proxy echo mirage is a very

5215
04:42:14,320 --> 04:42:17,280
flexible uh windows not hdp proxy but

5216
04:42:17,280 --> 04:42:19,360
it's only for windows

5217
04:42:19,360 --> 04:42:20,718
weirdly it's

5218
04:42:20,718 --> 04:42:24,320
not related at all to shadowrun um and

5219
04:42:24,320 --> 04:42:25,840
then you've got frida

5220
04:42:25,840 --> 04:42:28,240
i'm gonna be coming back to frida

5221
04:42:28,240 --> 04:42:30,718
this is this is kind of like my thing i

5222
04:42:30,718 --> 04:42:33,360
am obsessed with freda lately it's great

5223
04:42:33,360 --> 04:42:35,840
um you may have seen mobile tests it's

5224
04:42:35,840 --> 04:42:39,120
very very powerful very very useful

5225
04:42:39,120 --> 04:42:40,798
but it's also just ridiculously

5226
04:42:40,798 --> 04:42:43,840
complicated um really hard to understand

5227
04:42:43,840 --> 04:42:46,240
at times lacking documentation in some

5228
04:42:46,240 --> 04:42:47,840
areas that you might want it but

5229
04:42:47,840 --> 04:42:49,280
hopefully i can give you a starting

5230
04:42:49,280 --> 04:42:51,840
point there

5231
04:42:51,840 --> 04:42:53,200
another thing that you might see a lot

5232
04:42:53,200 --> 04:42:55,040
of is electron apps

5233
04:42:55,040 --> 04:42:57,840
electron apps are super duper easy to

5234
04:42:57,840 --> 04:42:59,760
bypass for proxime

5235
04:42:59,760 --> 04:43:02,560
you can simply add a line of code to the

5236
04:43:02,560 --> 04:43:04,080
electron.js

5237
04:43:04,080 --> 04:43:06,160
sort of manifest file

5238
04:43:06,160 --> 04:43:08,080
or you can literally run it from the

5239
04:43:08,080 --> 04:43:10,320
command line with ignore certificate

5240
04:43:10,320 --> 04:43:13,120
errors to bypass all certificate checks

5241
04:43:13,120 --> 04:43:14,638
and send it straight to your proxy from

5242
04:43:14,638 --> 04:43:17,200
there another tester bishopfoxcolton

5243
04:43:17,200 --> 04:43:19,440
noted that and uh yeah been using that

5244
04:43:19,440 --> 04:43:20,480
ever since

5245
04:43:20,480 --> 04:43:22,638
uh there's a bonus tool uh you know if

5246
04:43:22,638 --> 04:43:24,000
you're just looking for lots and lots of

5247
04:43:24,000 --> 04:43:25,840
different types of findings maybe things

5248
04:43:25,840 --> 04:43:27,840
that you might not actively exploit

5249
04:43:27,840 --> 04:43:29,680
electronegativity is great for electron

5250
04:43:29,680 --> 04:43:32,320
apps it will identify misconfigurations

5251
04:43:32,320 --> 04:43:34,718
similar to this um that will allow you

5252
04:43:34,718 --> 04:43:35,440
to

5253
04:43:35,440 --> 04:43:37,680
very very quickly um start a test and

5254
04:43:37,680 --> 04:43:40,160
get going

5255
04:43:40,240 --> 04:43:42,240
all right so

5256
04:43:42,240 --> 04:43:43,040
burp

5257
04:43:43,040 --> 04:43:44,718
uh i'm sure everybody has seen burp

5258
04:43:44,718 --> 04:43:48,160
before uh but if you haven't uh

5259
04:43:48,160 --> 04:43:49,840
the steps that you would take to put

5260
04:43:49,840 --> 04:43:52,560
into uh invisible proxy mode you simply

5261
04:43:52,560 --> 04:43:55,200
go to the proxy go to your options edit

5262
04:43:55,200 --> 04:43:57,840
your proxy listeners and click the old

5263
04:43:57,840 --> 04:43:58,798
uh

5264
04:43:58,798 --> 04:44:00,798
support invisible proxy and then you can

5265
04:44:00,798 --> 04:44:03,520
just redirect it uh redirect hosts to

5266
04:44:03,520 --> 04:44:06,400
uh arbitrary ports on your machine that

5267
04:44:06,400 --> 04:44:08,400
sort of good thing uh it's a relatively

5268
04:44:08,400 --> 04:44:10,240
straightforward process but can require

5269
04:44:10,240 --> 04:44:11,520
a little bit of fine tuning to make sure

5270
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:13,200
that you got it going right

5271
04:44:13,200 --> 04:44:14,798
i stole this graphic from another bishop

5272
04:44:14,798 --> 04:44:17,440
fox tester matt keeley thanks matt

5273
04:44:17,440 --> 04:44:19,040
somewhere out there uh

5274
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:21,600
he is not yet hearing me say that but he

5275
04:44:21,600 --> 04:44:24,000
will uh he'll be giving me a good wtf

5276
04:44:24,000 --> 04:44:26,400
after he sees that

5277
04:44:26,400 --> 04:44:29,280
and then intercepting traffic uh more of

5278
04:44:29,280 --> 04:44:30,798
that uh you can do that through fiddler

5279
04:44:30,798 --> 04:44:32,958
of course uh very simple process there

5280
04:44:32,958 --> 04:44:34,958
as well uh fiddler by default only

5281
04:44:34,958 --> 04:44:37,360
intercepts http traffic but again it

5282
04:44:37,360 --> 04:44:40,080
bypasses certificate pinning on https uh

5283
04:44:40,080 --> 04:44:42,400
you just have to turn that on

5284
04:44:42,400 --> 04:44:45,200
another thing you might need to do for

5285
04:44:45,200 --> 04:44:47,360
things like microsoft store apps which

5286
04:44:47,360 --> 04:44:49,920
by default are harder to proxy because

5287
04:44:49,920 --> 04:44:52,240
of the way their libraries work

5288
04:44:52,240 --> 04:44:53,920
you'll need to enable

5289
04:44:53,920 --> 04:44:55,600
a couple of windows 8 loopback

5290
04:44:55,600 --> 04:44:58,000
exemptions that applies even for windows

5291
04:44:58,000 --> 04:44:59,520
10 and beyond

5292
04:44:59,520 --> 04:45:01,840
i don't know why they're still called

5293
04:45:01,840 --> 04:45:03,680
windows 8 loopback exemptions but they

5294
04:45:03,680 --> 04:45:04,480
are

5295
04:45:04,480 --> 04:45:06,560
and that'll get you going to very easily

5296
04:45:06,560 --> 04:45:08,560
proxy stuff there and if you want you

5297
04:45:08,560 --> 04:45:10,000
can move that from if you don't like

5298
04:45:10,000 --> 04:45:11,600
fiddler you can move that from fiddler

5299
04:45:11,600 --> 04:45:12,878
back into burp

5300
04:45:12,878 --> 04:45:15,120
for the repeater or however you want it

5301
04:45:15,120 --> 04:45:18,480
a very straightforward process

5302
04:45:19,200 --> 04:45:20,878
now frida

5303
04:45:20,878 --> 04:45:23,360
this could be its own talk

5304
04:45:23,360 --> 04:45:25,920
so i won't go too in-depth here but

5305
04:45:25,920 --> 04:45:28,480
frida uh you may have seen

5306
04:45:28,480 --> 04:45:30,400
you may have seen it in the context of

5307
04:45:30,400 --> 04:45:32,638
mobile applications before it's really

5308
04:45:32,638 --> 04:45:34,320
really useful for disabling certificate

5309
04:45:34,320 --> 04:45:35,680
opinion and mobile applications there

5310
04:45:35,680 --> 04:45:36,878
are a lot of great scripts written for

5311
04:45:36,878 --> 04:45:39,360
it but one of the really core powers of

5312
04:45:39,360 --> 04:45:42,000
frida is that it can essentially inject

5313
04:45:42,000 --> 04:45:44,560
a listener into almost any function so

5314
04:45:44,560 --> 04:45:46,160
for windows applications this can be

5315
04:45:46,160 --> 04:45:48,958
dlls that are responsible for

5316
04:45:48,958 --> 04:45:51,760
sending traffic even encrypting traffic

5317
04:45:51,760 --> 04:45:54,240
even encrypting data

5318
04:45:54,240 --> 04:45:56,638
to store locally or remotely so this

5319
04:45:56,638 --> 04:45:58,240
could even be additional layers of

5320
04:45:58,240 --> 04:46:00,718
encryption that happen on top of ssl or

5321
04:46:00,718 --> 04:46:02,000
tls

5322
04:46:02,000 --> 04:46:04,160
so you really really

5323
04:46:04,160 --> 04:46:05,840
should look into tools like this that

5324
04:46:05,840 --> 04:46:07,440
work sort of like debuggers if you're

5325
04:46:07,440 --> 04:46:09,440
going to be working on a really uh

5326
04:46:09,440 --> 04:46:10,878
complicated proprietary piece of

5327
04:46:10,878 --> 04:46:12,638
software uh

5328
04:46:12,638 --> 04:46:14,320
but it's it's tricky to use there's not

5329
04:46:14,320 --> 04:46:16,798
a lot of documentation um i've got a

5330
04:46:16,798 --> 04:46:18,480
couple of examples of code here i'm not

5331
04:46:18,480 --> 04:46:20,320
going to go too in depth here but if you

5332
04:46:20,320 --> 04:46:22,560
know the named exported function you can

5333
04:46:22,560 --> 04:46:25,520
attach to it and you can intercept

5334
04:46:25,520 --> 04:46:27,680
all of the data there as the arguments

5335
04:46:27,680 --> 04:46:30,400
modify it and then send it back along

5336
04:46:30,400 --> 04:46:32,160
great for doing interception when

5337
04:46:32,160 --> 04:46:33,600
additional stuff is happening i'm

5338
04:46:33,600 --> 04:46:35,760
working on a testing harness that will

5339
04:46:35,760 --> 04:46:37,600
take a lot of time to work but as you

5340
04:46:37,600 --> 04:46:40,240
can see here i'm intercepting https

5341
04:46:40,240 --> 04:46:44,240
payloads to notepad exe and modifying

5342
04:46:44,240 --> 04:46:45,440
them there

5343
04:46:45,440 --> 04:46:48,638
i'm not exactly a ux designer so for me

5344
04:46:48,638 --> 04:46:50,400
for right now that's kind of how it

5345
04:46:50,400 --> 04:46:52,638
works

5346
04:46:52,638 --> 04:46:54,080
all right so

5347
04:46:54,080 --> 04:46:55,840
that's sort of our client to server

5348
04:46:55,840 --> 04:46:58,480
attack sort of mindset

5349
04:46:58,480 --> 04:46:59,680
at the end of this i'm going to show a

5350
04:46:59,680 --> 04:47:01,840
couple examples of

5351
04:47:01,840 --> 04:47:04,400
things that have come out of that but

5352
04:47:04,400 --> 04:47:07,200
that's really it for that portion

5353
04:47:07,200 --> 04:47:08,718
i'm going to move on now to local

5354
04:47:08,718 --> 04:47:10,400
privilege escalation and talking about

5355
04:47:10,400 --> 04:47:12,320
how we can move

5356
04:47:12,320 --> 04:47:14,798
from maybe a contained environment up to

5357
04:47:14,798 --> 04:47:18,480
a uh root user or something like that

5358
04:47:18,480 --> 04:47:21,440
um and really this stuff is very

5359
04:47:21,440 --> 04:47:24,400
ctf-like uh it's very much like pwning

5360
04:47:24,400 --> 04:47:25,200
um

5361
04:47:25,200 --> 04:47:26,638
it's very application because you could

5362
04:47:26,638 --> 04:47:28,400
install it on your own machine so you

5363
04:47:28,400 --> 04:47:30,718
should use that power to

5364
04:47:30,718 --> 04:47:32,320
identify paths

5365
04:47:32,320 --> 04:47:33,680
that you could use in a more restricted

5366
04:47:33,680 --> 04:47:35,600
environment where you're not rude

5367
04:47:35,600 --> 04:47:36,878
one of the things that you can look to

5368
04:47:36,878 --> 04:47:39,120
see if you can do for a binary like this

5369
04:47:39,120 --> 04:47:40,718
is check to see if you can modify the

5370
04:47:40,718 --> 04:47:43,120
binary directly is the default install

5371
04:47:43,120 --> 04:47:45,040
path safe and secure

5372
04:47:45,040 --> 04:47:47,200
on windows this is uh particularly a

5373
04:47:47,200 --> 04:47:49,680
problem that you might see oftentimes

5374
04:47:49,680 --> 04:47:51,520
because other services

5375
04:47:51,520 --> 04:47:53,600
need to be able to use

5376
04:47:53,600 --> 04:47:55,680
these binaries and some of the files and

5377
04:47:55,680 --> 04:47:57,600
modify those files

5378
04:47:57,600 --> 04:47:59,120
again i've got a lot of code up here

5379
04:47:59,120 --> 04:48:00,638
that just things that you can run in

5380
04:48:00,638 --> 04:48:03,440
powershell not the most beautiful

5381
04:48:03,440 --> 04:48:04,878
but these slides

5382
04:48:04,878 --> 04:48:06,160
hopefully will be available somewhere

5383
04:48:06,160 --> 04:48:07,360
that you can go ahead and grab those

5384
04:48:07,360 --> 04:48:09,440
commands you can use these commands here

5385
04:48:09,440 --> 04:48:11,280
to for example look for higher

5386
04:48:11,280 --> 04:48:12,878
privileged services

5387
04:48:12,878 --> 04:48:14,718
those services might look at the files

5388
04:48:14,718 --> 04:48:16,798
that you have the ability to modify

5389
04:48:16,798 --> 04:48:19,120
and might do things with that so they

5390
04:48:19,120 --> 04:48:20,480
could run

5391
04:48:20,480 --> 04:48:23,200
code that you can actually modify

5392
04:48:23,200 --> 04:48:24,958
and you can do things like check for

5393
04:48:24,958 --> 04:48:26,798
unquoted service paths

5394
04:48:26,798 --> 04:48:28,878
which will allow you to potentially

5395
04:48:28,878 --> 04:48:29,680
again

5396
04:48:29,680 --> 04:48:31,520
execute code

5397
04:48:31,520 --> 04:48:33,760
not directly but through

5398
04:48:33,760 --> 04:48:35,920
the windows system itself so being able

5399
04:48:35,920 --> 04:48:37,920
to modify files and

5400
04:48:37,920 --> 04:48:40,878
look at those install paths is really

5401
04:48:40,878 --> 04:48:42,400
the the most important thing that you

5402
04:48:42,400 --> 04:48:44,160
can do when you're first looking for

5403
04:48:44,160 --> 04:48:45,920
privileged escalation you can also

5404
04:48:45,920 --> 04:48:48,240
obviously look at windows pat or sorry

5405
04:48:48,240 --> 04:48:50,878
inputs uh inputs are you know very

5406
04:48:50,878 --> 04:48:53,520
common uh way for

5407
04:48:53,520 --> 04:48:55,040
you know like not a classic buffer

5408
04:48:55,040 --> 04:48:58,240
overflow but you can do a lot with that

5409
04:48:58,240 --> 04:48:59,360
more stuff that you can do that's kind

5410
04:48:59,360 --> 04:49:01,280
of weird with windows

5411
04:49:01,280 --> 04:49:03,840
dll hijacking

5412
04:49:03,840 --> 04:49:04,878
i'm sure

5413
04:49:04,878 --> 04:49:06,878
if you've used a windows computer

5414
04:49:06,878 --> 04:49:08,560
or if you know you've definitely seen

5415
04:49:08,560 --> 04:49:10,400
this if you're windows pen testing pro

5416
04:49:10,400 --> 04:49:11,840
but if you've used windows computer

5417
04:49:11,840 --> 04:49:14,080
you've probably seen the dll file on

5418
04:49:14,080 --> 04:49:15,680
your computer before

5419
04:49:15,680 --> 04:49:18,878
those dlls allow you to uh

5420
04:49:18,878 --> 04:49:20,798
those are basically linked libraries

5421
04:49:20,798 --> 04:49:23,440
that exist outside of the binary and

5422
04:49:23,440 --> 04:49:24,160
they

5423
04:49:24,160 --> 04:49:26,480
are added to the code execution in a

5424
04:49:26,480 --> 04:49:28,638
specific order

5425
04:49:28,638 --> 04:49:31,360
in some cases you can modify dlls and

5426
04:49:31,360 --> 04:49:33,680
change the code in other cases you can

5427
04:49:33,680 --> 04:49:36,400
make sure that your named dll is loaded

5428
04:49:36,400 --> 04:49:38,480
before the actual one

5429
04:49:38,480 --> 04:49:41,360
which is called search order hijacking

5430
04:49:41,360 --> 04:49:43,280
you can also do a similar thing with dll

5431
04:49:43,280 --> 04:49:45,520
path hijacking if you can modify an

5432
04:49:45,520 --> 04:49:47,600
executable's manifest

5433
04:49:47,600 --> 04:49:48,878
and you can also do relative path

5434
04:49:48,878 --> 04:49:50,638
hijacking which is where you do a fun

5435
04:49:50,638 --> 04:49:52,240
thing where you copy the entire

5436
04:49:52,240 --> 04:49:53,840
executable and move it to a different

5437
04:49:53,840 --> 04:49:55,040
directory

5438
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:55,840
which

5439
04:49:55,840 --> 04:49:57,440
sometimes works

5440
04:49:57,440 --> 04:49:59,600
very cool stuff and you can make a

5441
04:49:59,600 --> 04:50:01,120
really quick test

5442
04:50:01,120 --> 04:50:03,760
malicious dll here with meterpreter just

5443
04:50:03,760 --> 04:50:05,440
to see if you got something working but

5444
04:50:05,440 --> 04:50:06,798
once you know that you've got dll

5445
04:50:06,798 --> 04:50:09,520
hijacking you can do anything you want

5446
04:50:09,520 --> 04:50:11,520
especially if that application is being

5447
04:50:11,520 --> 04:50:13,920
executed by another user or in higher

5448
04:50:13,920 --> 04:50:16,798
privileged context

5449
04:50:17,120 --> 04:50:18,400
if you've never done anything like this

5450
04:50:18,400 --> 04:50:20,798
before and you just want to try it out i

5451
04:50:20,798 --> 04:50:22,718
recommend the damn vulnerable fit client

5452
04:50:22,718 --> 04:50:25,280
application uh it's really cool it has a

5453
04:50:25,280 --> 04:50:27,280
lot of these vulnerabilities and they

5454
04:50:27,280 --> 04:50:29,280
have a lot of write-ups for it as well

5455
04:50:29,280 --> 04:50:32,240
that you can just do these things and

5456
04:50:32,240 --> 04:50:35,040
yeah it's not not too not too crazy a

5457
04:50:35,040 --> 04:50:37,360
lot of tutorials on how to exactly do a

5458
04:50:37,360 --> 04:50:38,638
lot of the methodologies that i'm sort

5459
04:50:38,638 --> 04:50:40,638
of talking around here

5460
04:50:40,638 --> 04:50:41,520
uh

5461
04:50:41,520 --> 04:50:44,080
now back to mac and linux these are all

5462
04:50:44,080 --> 04:50:45,360
the classics i'm not going to go too

5463
04:50:45,360 --> 04:50:48,400
deep into this again either because

5464
04:50:48,400 --> 04:50:50,240
it's it's sort of its own course

5465
04:50:50,240 --> 04:50:53,040
material i guess in a lot of uh mindsets

5466
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:55,760
of security uh but yeah suid

5467
04:50:55,760 --> 04:50:57,360
misconfiguration looking for suid

5468
04:50:57,360 --> 04:51:00,000
misconfigurations where anything uh is

5469
04:51:00,000 --> 04:51:01,440
able to be run

5470
04:51:01,440 --> 04:51:04,560
with uh as root or uh as pseudo without

5471
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:07,280
permission um looking for cron jobs run

5472
04:51:07,280 --> 04:51:09,600
by higher privileged users that

5473
04:51:09,600 --> 04:51:10,878
are based on files that you have the

5474
04:51:10,878 --> 04:51:13,520
ability to write relative path hijacking

5475
04:51:13,520 --> 04:51:15,760
so again looking for things like scripts

5476
04:51:15,760 --> 04:51:17,920
or binaries that call

5477
04:51:17,920 --> 04:51:20,000
without defining the absolute path and

5478
04:51:20,000 --> 04:51:21,920
then adding something new to a user's

5479
04:51:21,920 --> 04:51:24,718
path uh and world writable scripts

5480
04:51:24,718 --> 04:51:26,560
if there's a script that root runs and

5481
04:51:26,560 --> 04:51:29,120
you can write to it you sh

5482
04:51:29,120 --> 04:51:30,958
uh i won't say you should do it but you

5483
04:51:30,958 --> 04:51:34,400
can do it for privilege escalation

5484
04:51:34,400 --> 04:51:36,080
uh and this does

5485
04:51:36,080 --> 04:51:38,878
actually happen um quite a bit um so

5486
04:51:38,878 --> 04:51:41,840
here's a real example um a little bit of

5487
04:51:41,840 --> 04:51:43,360
the information changed around from a

5488
04:51:43,360 --> 04:51:45,680
test that was performed but you can see

5489
04:51:45,680 --> 04:51:47,760
here uh

5490
04:51:47,760 --> 04:51:50,638
there was a curl command running in an

5491
04:51:50,638 --> 04:51:53,120
application test uh in a script that the

5492
04:51:53,120 --> 04:51:56,480
user had the ability to read not write

5493
04:51:56,480 --> 04:51:57,920
but this uh

5494
04:51:57,920 --> 04:52:00,718
executable was run as root and by chain

5495
04:52:00,718 --> 04:52:04,320
by doing a relative path hijack um in

5496
04:52:04,320 --> 04:52:07,760
real tests we were able to uh

5497
04:52:07,760 --> 04:52:10,000
perform code execution and go from a low

5498
04:52:10,000 --> 04:52:11,680
privileged user to high privileged user

5499
04:52:11,680 --> 04:52:12,878
this is i mean again this is pretty

5500
04:52:12,878 --> 04:52:14,718
common stuff this is the sort of thing

5501
04:52:14,718 --> 04:52:16,160
that you would see with

5502
04:52:16,160 --> 04:52:16,958
uh

5503
04:52:16,958 --> 04:52:18,160
maybe like a

5504
04:52:18,160 --> 04:52:20,320
an internal test or a test where you're

5505
04:52:20,320 --> 04:52:22,160
going from one machine and trying to get

5506
04:52:22,160 --> 04:52:24,080
a lot of other machines on the network

5507
04:52:24,080 --> 04:52:26,480
but you can do this in all sorts of

5508
04:52:26,480 --> 04:52:28,638
places it's a very common

5509
04:52:28,638 --> 04:52:30,480
mistake for developers to make from a

5510
04:52:30,480 --> 04:52:33,360
security point of view

5511
04:52:33,920 --> 04:52:35,520
one of the other things that you can do

5512
04:52:35,520 --> 04:52:36,958
to try to

5513
04:52:36,958 --> 04:52:38,240
escalate your privileges from a low

5514
04:52:38,240 --> 04:52:39,600
point of view if you can at least run

5515
04:52:39,600 --> 04:52:42,080
the application um is you can start

5516
04:52:42,080 --> 04:52:44,080
stealing secrets there are a couple ways

5517
04:52:44,080 --> 04:52:45,200
to do this

5518
04:52:45,200 --> 04:52:47,360
you can use frydump

5519
04:52:47,360 --> 04:52:49,680
which again going back to frida uses

5520
04:52:49,680 --> 04:52:51,360
frida to dump

5521
04:52:51,360 --> 04:52:53,200
memory and then pull all the strings

5522
04:52:53,200 --> 04:52:54,120
from it

5523
04:52:54,120 --> 04:52:58,320
procdump.exe does a similar thing um

5524
04:52:58,320 --> 04:53:00,480
progthump is better for windows and

5525
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:03,120
frydump is better for

5526
04:53:03,120 --> 04:53:04,958
mac and linux but

5527
04:53:04,958 --> 04:53:07,120
both very useful um if you just need to

5528
04:53:07,120 --> 04:53:08,878
analyze the strings and memory and you

5529
04:53:08,878 --> 04:53:10,638
can get all sorts of cool stuff in

5530
04:53:10,638 --> 04:53:12,718
windows from process hacker

5531
04:53:12,718 --> 04:53:14,000
something that i recommend trying out

5532
04:53:14,000 --> 04:53:14,958
too

5533
04:53:14,958 --> 04:53:16,480
once you know the process id you can do

5534
04:53:16,480 --> 04:53:18,320
things like get

5535
04:53:18,320 --> 04:53:21,120
memory get dlls get all sorts of data

5536
04:53:21,120 --> 04:53:23,840
that's being loaded

5537
04:53:25,040 --> 04:53:26,480
and of course one of the last things

5538
04:53:26,480 --> 04:53:28,160
that you might want to look at is doing

5539
04:53:28,160 --> 04:53:30,798
reverse engineering fire up your

5540
04:53:30,798 --> 04:53:33,600
idas your binary ninjas your yidras

5541
04:53:33,600 --> 04:53:35,280
whatever you want

5542
04:53:35,280 --> 04:53:37,440
you know you can use dl export viewer to

5543
04:53:37,440 --> 04:53:39,200
look at your name dlls and load those

5544
04:53:39,200 --> 04:53:40,878
into your reverse engineering tools as

5545
04:53:40,878 --> 04:53:41,920
well

5546
04:53:41,920 --> 04:53:43,840
and again i

5547
04:53:43,840 --> 04:53:45,200
told you i was going to come back to it

5548
04:53:45,200 --> 04:53:47,760
frida you can watch functions in frida

5549
04:53:47,760 --> 04:53:49,520
you may not know about a dll that's been

5550
04:53:49,520 --> 04:53:51,680
loaded or you may not know about a

5551
04:53:51,680 --> 04:53:53,200
particular

5552
04:53:53,200 --> 04:53:55,120
exported function that's being used but

5553
04:53:55,120 --> 04:53:57,040
you can use free to trace to find out in

5554
04:53:57,040 --> 04:53:59,040
basically any architecture

5555
04:53:59,040 --> 04:54:01,200
some of the functions that are being

5556
04:54:01,200 --> 04:54:03,920
used to communicate or do sensitive

5557
04:54:03,920 --> 04:54:05,120
operations

5558
04:54:05,120 --> 04:54:07,520
here on from frida's own website they

5559
04:54:07,520 --> 04:54:09,920
have decorating the receive and send

5560
04:54:09,920 --> 04:54:12,080
functions in safari as an example which

5561
04:54:12,080 --> 04:54:14,718
will let you see all of the traffic

5562
04:54:14,718 --> 04:54:17,440
or start to access all the traffic um

5563
04:54:17,440 --> 04:54:20,798
that's being used to communicate

5564
04:54:20,798 --> 04:54:22,000
a lot of people think of it as just a

5565
04:54:22,000 --> 04:54:24,080
mobile tool but it works on like a ton

5566
04:54:24,080 --> 04:54:26,718
of different things uh so yeah can't

5567
04:54:26,718 --> 04:54:28,958
recommend enough

5568
04:54:28,958 --> 04:54:31,920
all right and now uh finally the last

5569
04:54:31,920 --> 04:54:34,400
sort of stage of this uh server to

5570
04:54:34,400 --> 04:54:36,320
client this is where things can be

5571
04:54:36,320 --> 04:54:37,440
really

5572
04:54:37,440 --> 04:54:39,680
really bad

5573
04:54:39,680 --> 04:54:41,520
uh so one of the most common things

5574
04:54:41,520 --> 04:54:43,840
you'll see if you can compromise a web

5575
04:54:43,840 --> 04:54:46,878
application um that is being used to

5576
04:54:46,878 --> 04:54:49,200
administer thick clients or communicate

5577
04:54:49,200 --> 04:54:50,798
with the clients

5578
04:54:50,798 --> 04:54:53,360
you can essentially

5579
04:54:53,360 --> 04:54:55,520
target all of the

5580
04:54:55,520 --> 04:54:57,040
fit clients that communicate back with

5581
04:54:57,040 --> 04:54:58,718
the server this can take a lot of

5582
04:54:58,718 --> 04:55:00,638
different forms but

5583
04:55:00,638 --> 04:55:02,958
there are a lot of applications that let

5584
04:55:02,958 --> 04:55:04,718
you do uh

5585
04:55:04,718 --> 04:55:08,080
run scripts and code on those machines

5586
04:55:08,080 --> 04:55:09,760
sometimes it's intended to be done in a

5587
04:55:09,760 --> 04:55:11,920
limited way but with things like mdm

5588
04:55:11,920 --> 04:55:13,280
applications

5589
04:55:13,280 --> 04:55:15,600
you can do all sorts of crazy things

5590
04:55:15,600 --> 04:55:17,920
so for example if an mdm application

5591
04:55:17,920 --> 04:55:20,798
allows you to run predefined scripts uh

5592
04:55:20,798 --> 04:55:22,560
if you can abuse the backend service

5593
04:55:22,560 --> 04:55:23,520
there

5594
04:55:23,520 --> 04:55:25,760
then you can find a way to run a script

5595
04:55:25,760 --> 04:55:28,080
on potentially every client

5596
04:55:28,080 --> 04:55:32,560
that is being used for that mdm software

5597
04:55:32,560 --> 04:55:35,760
and here just as an example of that from

5598
04:55:35,760 --> 04:55:37,920
a test that we performed

5599
04:55:37,920 --> 04:55:40,798
getting arbitrary files on any machine

5600
04:55:40,798 --> 04:55:42,480
that we hijacked

5601
04:55:42,480 --> 04:55:44,240
and it is of course

5602
04:55:44,240 --> 04:55:46,958
rce as a service so it's no surprise

5603
04:55:46,958 --> 04:55:50,480
that hijacking the back end of a

5604
04:55:50,480 --> 04:55:52,718
administrative tool can get execution on

5605
04:55:52,718 --> 04:55:55,840
a lot of different things

5606
04:55:55,920 --> 04:55:57,120
uh there are a lot of different things

5607
04:55:57,120 --> 04:55:59,280
that you also might want to look for uh

5608
04:55:59,280 --> 04:56:02,000
for other paths here um one of the

5609
04:56:02,000 --> 04:56:04,480
things you might want to look for uh are

5610
04:56:04,480 --> 04:56:06,798
mistakes uh in the way that the fit

5611
04:56:06,798 --> 04:56:09,120
client handles things that are coming

5612
04:56:09,120 --> 04:56:10,480
from the server

5613
04:56:10,480 --> 04:56:11,920
that could take the form of vulnerable

5614
04:56:11,920 --> 04:56:14,160
dependencies that could take the form of

5615
04:56:14,160 --> 04:56:17,280
something as classic as a zip slip

5616
04:56:17,280 --> 04:56:20,798
where a zip file is unpacked improperly

5617
04:56:20,798 --> 04:56:23,360
and you can put malicious code anywhere

5618
04:56:23,360 --> 04:56:24,798
on the file system

5619
04:56:24,798 --> 04:56:26,080
it could just be as simple as path

5620
04:56:26,080 --> 04:56:27,680
traversal

5621
04:56:27,680 --> 04:56:29,040
from

5622
04:56:29,040 --> 04:56:30,000
you know you're supposed to pull

5623
04:56:30,000 --> 04:56:31,440
something down and you name the file a

5624
04:56:31,440 --> 04:56:33,040
new path

5625
04:56:33,040 --> 04:56:35,440
or it could be something like a local

5626
04:56:35,440 --> 04:56:36,400
server

5627
04:56:36,400 --> 04:56:38,878
that is running on the fit client

5628
04:56:38,878 --> 04:56:40,958
application that is meant to receive

5629
04:56:40,958 --> 04:56:43,680
communications from other applications

5630
04:56:43,680 --> 04:56:46,160
on the network or from the server that

5631
04:56:46,160 --> 04:56:48,718
doesn't have functioning authentication

5632
04:56:48,718 --> 04:56:50,560
and then another sort of one-to-many

5633
04:56:50,560 --> 04:56:52,480
approach that you might want to take is

5634
04:56:52,480 --> 04:56:54,240
if you can compromise a web application

5635
04:56:54,240 --> 04:56:57,200
or even just use it as intended um for a

5636
04:56:57,200 --> 04:56:58,638
back end you might want to look for

5637
04:56:58,638 --> 04:57:00,958
remote update functionalities uh remote

5638
04:57:00,958 --> 04:57:02,958
management functionalities and remote

5639
04:57:02,958 --> 04:57:05,120
file uploads all those things if you can

5640
04:57:05,120 --> 04:57:07,360
do those to a thick client

5641
04:57:07,360 --> 04:57:08,480
then

5642
04:57:08,480 --> 04:57:11,120
it can have pretty serious ramifications

5643
04:57:11,120 --> 04:57:13,280
but especially if those back ends have

5644
04:57:13,280 --> 04:57:14,718
their own authentication and

5645
04:57:14,718 --> 04:57:18,160
authorization flaws

5646
04:57:18,160 --> 04:57:21,040
uh here's a fun little example of a

5647
04:57:21,040 --> 04:57:23,920
local file server that was misconfigured

5648
04:57:23,920 --> 04:57:26,878
um in one case uh an application that we

5649
04:57:26,878 --> 04:57:30,160
were looking at had the ability to

5650
04:57:30,160 --> 04:57:32,160
communicate have other devices on the

5651
04:57:32,160 --> 04:57:34,400
network communicate with a file

5652
04:57:34,400 --> 04:57:37,920
a file server that was located uh just

5653
04:57:37,920 --> 04:57:39,280
it was intended to only be exposed to

5654
04:57:39,280 --> 04:57:41,440
the local host but by default it would

5655
04:57:41,440 --> 04:57:43,440
listen on uh the

5656
04:57:43,440 --> 04:57:46,400
public uh network interface um this

5657
04:57:46,400 --> 04:57:48,480
allowed us to perform csrf against the

5658
04:57:48,480 --> 04:57:50,798
thick client and uh

5659
04:57:50,798 --> 04:57:52,958
the csrf allowed us to execute any

5660
04:57:52,958 --> 04:57:56,080
binary in this case command.exe

5661
04:57:56,080 --> 04:57:57,680
so a very fun

5662
04:57:57,680 --> 04:57:59,600
very fun situation where

5663
04:57:59,600 --> 04:58:01,120
by going to

5664
04:58:01,120 --> 04:58:02,320
a

5665
04:58:02,320 --> 04:58:04,080
just a url here

5666
04:58:04,080 --> 04:58:08,240
we were able to pull up a shell

5667
04:58:08,480 --> 04:58:10,160
and another bizarre but real scenario

5668
04:58:10,160 --> 04:58:11,280
this is really kind of the last real

5669
04:58:11,280 --> 04:58:13,760
world thing before i open up to

5670
04:58:13,760 --> 04:58:15,440
questions um

5671
04:58:15,440 --> 04:58:17,840
here's an example of a real architecture

5672
04:58:17,840 --> 04:58:19,600
that we saw um

5673
04:58:19,600 --> 04:58:22,080
obviously very simplified but one where

5674
04:58:22,080 --> 04:58:23,840
a thick client performed an update

5675
04:58:23,840 --> 04:58:27,120
process over http over wi-fi

5676
04:58:27,120 --> 04:58:28,798
to pull down updates from the

5677
04:58:28,798 --> 04:58:31,840
application server and invoke uh

5678
04:58:31,840 --> 04:58:34,160
a the update process in python with a

5679
04:58:34,160 --> 04:58:37,520
sub process dot p open and

5680
04:58:37,520 --> 04:58:39,520
anybody with better cap could hop on the

5681
04:58:39,520 --> 04:58:40,480
network

5682
04:58:40,480 --> 04:58:42,560
intercept this update process and gain

5683
04:58:42,560 --> 04:58:44,878
code execution over the update process

5684
04:58:44,878 --> 04:58:47,600
of these the clients um so these sorts

5685
04:58:47,600 --> 04:58:49,840
of things are out there they're real

5686
04:58:49,840 --> 04:58:51,760
you'll be surprised if you go out and do

5687
04:58:51,760 --> 04:58:53,760
this testing you can see all sorts of

5688
04:58:53,760 --> 04:58:54,958
crazy stuff

5689
04:58:54,958 --> 04:58:56,638
a lot of people i think are turned off

5690
04:58:56,638 --> 04:58:58,480
by the clients because they seem more

5691
04:58:58,480 --> 04:59:02,000
complicated um or maybe just less common

5692
04:59:02,000 --> 04:59:04,080
but in a lot of ways the configuration

5693
04:59:04,080 --> 04:59:06,320
flaws are more serious than you'll see

5694
04:59:06,320 --> 04:59:09,040
in a web application today so

5695
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:11,920
there you go the clients uh if anybody

5696
04:59:11,920 --> 04:59:13,360
has any questions

5697
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:16,160
now's the time i guess uh

5698
04:59:16,160 --> 04:59:19,540
otherwise yeah

5699
04:59:19,540 --> 04:59:25,490
[Applause]

5700
04:59:28,000 --> 04:59:32,200
all right oh yes question

5701
04:59:41,360 --> 04:59:42,718
that's a great question so the question

5702
04:59:42,718 --> 04:59:45,600
was about uh when modifying dlls or

5703
04:59:45,600 --> 04:59:47,600
adding new code to a thick client

5704
04:59:47,600 --> 04:59:49,600
application does code signing become an

5705
04:59:49,600 --> 04:59:51,840
issue here and yes absolutely it does

5706
04:59:51,840 --> 04:59:53,120
that can be something that's really hard

5707
04:59:53,120 --> 04:59:54,320
to get around

5708
04:59:54,320 --> 04:59:56,560
but if you are looking into the

5709
04:59:56,560 --> 04:59:58,560
libraries that are at like if you're

5710
04:59:58,560 --> 05:00:00,320
already able to reverse engineer the

5711
05:00:00,320 --> 05:00:02,958
code sometimes you can find out

5712
05:00:02,958 --> 05:00:04,560
in some cases where those certificates

5713
05:00:04,560 --> 05:00:06,638
for code signing might live in other

5714
05:00:06,638 --> 05:00:08,560
cases they may just do the code signing

5715
05:00:08,560 --> 05:00:09,840
wrong

5716
05:00:09,840 --> 05:00:11,440
and those are ways around that but you

5717
05:00:11,440 --> 05:00:13,840
do have to work around it if you see it

5718
05:00:13,840 --> 05:00:15,840
but yeah that's that's absolutely a real

5719
05:00:15,840 --> 05:00:18,840
challenge

5720
05:00:22,320 --> 05:00:26,480
okay well i'll be around if uh yeah

5721
05:00:26,480 --> 05:00:27,890
thank you again

5722
05:00:27,890 --> 05:00:36,168
[Applause]

5723
05:00:43,680 --> 05:00:47,040
all right so um we are

5724
05:00:47,040 --> 05:00:50,958
25 minutes ahead of schedule which is a

5725
05:00:50,958 --> 05:00:52,798
words that never come out of my mouth at

5726
05:00:52,798 --> 05:00:55,520
summer con that's for sure uh so what i

5727
05:00:55,520 --> 05:00:59,120
will uh suggest we do

5728
05:01:00,958 --> 05:01:02,560
get a drink

5729
05:01:02,560 --> 05:01:04,878
and be back in 20 minutes how does that

5730

um so yeah we're we're we're doing it on

5819
05:26:10,080 --> 05:26:13,520
on schedule um i just a brief

5820
05:26:13,520 --> 05:26:16,480
announcement uh for for aaron

um

5827
05:26:28,320 --> 05:26:30,718
and uh we're gonna go straight into our

5828
05:26:30,718 --> 05:26:33,440
next presentation uh grant seltzer

5829
05:26:33,440 --> 05:26:35,040
richmond is going to

5830
05:26:35,040 --> 05:26:36,480
talk us through

5831
05:26:36,480 --> 05:26:39,440
uh what would certainly uh have a catchy

5832
05:26:39,440 --> 05:26:40,958
title for my daughter who is 10 and

5833
05:26:40,958 --> 05:26:43,120
loves cats i think she will be a bit

5834
05:26:43,120 --> 05:26:46,320
surprised by meow please give a warm

5835
05:26:46,320 --> 05:26:49,280
welcome to grant

5836
05:26:55,440 --> 05:26:57,840
hi everyone

5837
05:27:00,400 --> 05:27:03,680
uh so yeah uh title of my talk is

5838
05:27:03,680 --> 05:27:08,638
memory execution override with ebpf

5839
05:27:08,878 --> 05:27:11,280
uh quick who am i i'm a software

5840
05:27:11,280 --> 05:27:13,360
engineer i'm on the open source team at

5841
05:27:13,360 --> 05:27:14,320
aqua

5842
05:27:14,320 --> 05:27:17,200
uh i work on a project called tracy uh

5843
05:27:17,200 --> 05:27:19,520
basically like a

5844
05:27:19,520 --> 05:27:21,920
uh runtime detection tool

5845
05:27:21,920 --> 05:27:24,638
uh as well as the lib vpf bindings for

5846
05:27:24,638 --> 05:27:26,878
go called the bpf go

5847
05:27:26,878 --> 05:27:29,200
i'm a regular contributor to bpf and lib

5848
05:27:29,200 --> 05:27:30,558
epf

5849
05:27:30,558 --> 05:27:32,638
i'm also one of those people who finds a

5850
05:27:32,638 --> 05:27:34,798
new hobby and let it define their whole

5851
05:27:34,798 --> 05:27:37,440
personality so right now that's bikes so

5852
05:27:37,440 --> 05:27:38,958
i'm one of those people in prospect park

5853
05:27:38,958 --> 05:27:41,360
who's like going around uh in like

5854
05:27:41,360 --> 05:27:43,360
bright pink spandex yelling at people to

5855
05:27:43,360 --> 05:27:45,280
get the hell out of the way

5856
05:27:45,280 --> 05:27:47,520
so that's me even when i'm not riding a

5857
05:27:47,520 --> 05:27:49,760
bike

5858
05:27:49,840 --> 05:27:52,400
uh so what's this talk about uh the goal

5859
05:27:52,400 --> 05:27:55,200
of this talk uh isn't to really go deep

5860
05:27:55,200 --> 05:27:56,320
on a new

5861
05:27:56,320 --> 05:28:00,558
uh technique or anything uh it's more so

5862
05:28:00,558 --> 05:28:01,840
to

5863
05:28:01,840 --> 05:28:03,440
expose some of you to some new

5864
05:28:03,440 --> 05:28:05,200
technologies or some

5865
05:28:05,200 --> 05:28:08,080
techniques that you might not have ever

5866
05:28:08,080 --> 05:28:09,840
explored before

5867
05:28:09,840 --> 05:28:11,200
if you're someone with a background in

5868
05:28:11,200 --> 05:28:13,200
reverse engineering uh parts of this

5869
05:28:13,200 --> 05:28:15,440
talk might be a little elementary for

5870
05:28:15,440 --> 05:28:17,360
you but hopefully you'll learn something

5871
05:28:17,360 --> 05:28:19,200
new about ebpf

5872
05:28:19,200 --> 05:28:22,160
also all the people who are talking in

5873
05:28:22,160 --> 05:28:24,320
the back i really recommend going to

5874
05:28:24,320 --> 05:28:26,320
park life around the corner but

5875
05:28:26,320 --> 05:28:29,680
otherwise shut the [ __ ] up

5876
05:28:32,558 --> 05:28:35,760
okay cool uh and if you're if you're

5877
05:28:35,760 --> 05:28:37,440
someone who doesn't have any experience

5878
05:28:37,440 --> 05:28:40,480
with reversing uh or returning to return

5879
05:28:40,480 --> 05:28:41,840
oriented programming or anything like

5880
05:28:41,840 --> 05:28:44,320
that or bpf or linux uh

5881
05:28:44,320 --> 05:28:47,120
i hope you have fun

5882
05:28:47,120 --> 05:28:51,040
uh so let's talk uh briefly about

5883
05:28:51,040 --> 05:28:54,400
uh what ebpf is uh ebpf is a virtual

5884
05:28:54,400 --> 05:28:56,558
machine inside the linux kernel it lets

5885
05:28:56,558 --> 05:28:57,760
you run these

5886
05:28:57,760 --> 05:29:01,360
uh small programs that are written in c

5887
05:29:01,360 --> 05:29:03,200
and attach them to various points within

5888
05:29:03,200 --> 05:29:04,558
the kernel so

5889
05:29:04,558 --> 05:29:05,920
it's sort of like

5890
05:29:05,920 --> 05:29:06,878
uh

5891
05:29:06,878 --> 05:29:08,638
you know the traditional way of

5892
05:29:08,638 --> 05:29:11,520
explaining it is like javascript to html

5893
05:29:11,520 --> 05:29:13,760
ebpf is to linux so

5894
05:29:13,760 --> 05:29:15,200
sort of like attaching a web hook to

5895
05:29:15,200 --> 05:29:17,840
something within the kernel so

5896
05:29:17,840 --> 05:29:19,360
things like system calls every time a

5897
05:29:19,360 --> 05:29:21,120
system call is

5898
05:29:21,120 --> 05:29:23,280
executed you could have a bpf program

5899
05:29:23,280 --> 05:29:24,400
trigger

5900
05:29:24,400 --> 05:29:26,958
same with like kernel functions like

5901
05:29:26,958 --> 05:29:29,120
functions within the linux kernel source

5902
05:29:29,120 --> 05:29:31,760
code as it's compiled

5903
05:29:31,760 --> 05:29:35,440
networking mechanisms so tc and xtp like

5904
05:29:35,440 --> 05:29:37,440
for example you may have seen a blog

5905
05:29:37,440 --> 05:29:39,600
post from cloudflare they do a lot

5906
05:29:39,600 --> 05:29:41,600
related to bpf for ddos protection you

5907
05:29:41,600 --> 05:29:43,120
could attach it to

5908
05:29:43,120 --> 05:29:45,680
things like xtp which are like the the

5909
05:29:45,680 --> 05:29:48,160
first point in the kernel that

5910
05:29:48,160 --> 05:29:50,400
network packets arrive on or ethernet

5911
05:29:50,400 --> 05:29:53,040
frames or whatever it is

5912
05:29:53,040 --> 05:29:54,718
you can write bpf programs that attach

5913
05:29:54,718 --> 05:29:57,040
that and filter out that way

5914
05:29:57,040 --> 05:29:58,638
as well as like lsm hooks you could

5915
05:29:58,638 --> 05:30:00,240
actually do enforcement and write a

5916
05:30:00,240 --> 05:30:04,000
linux security module with bpf

5917
05:30:04,160 --> 05:30:05,200
so

5918
05:30:05,200 --> 05:30:06,878
yeah so essentially just so that you

5919
05:30:06,878 --> 05:30:09,280
could picture it if you're not familiar

5920
05:30:09,280 --> 05:30:11,840
you have like a user space program that

5921
05:30:11,840 --> 05:30:12,798
will

5922
05:30:12,798 --> 05:30:14,400
uh

5923
05:30:14,400 --> 05:30:16,798
that's you know ebpf like you write the

5924
05:30:16,798 --> 05:30:19,120
c code you compile it you have a user

5925
05:30:19,120 --> 05:30:20,958
space program that

5926
05:30:20,958 --> 05:30:23,920
loads and attaches it to whatever

5927
05:30:23,920 --> 05:30:25,040
point in the kernel that you want to

5928
05:30:25,040 --> 05:30:26,638
attach it to

5929
05:30:26,638 --> 05:30:28,080
and then

5930
05:30:28,080 --> 05:30:29,760
you know it triggers and you can have

5931
05:30:29,760 --> 05:30:32,080
feedback into your user space program

5932
05:30:32,080 --> 05:30:35,840
so in this example we have a

5933
05:30:35,840 --> 05:30:37,360
user space program that's attaching a

5934
05:30:37,360 --> 05:30:39,040
bpf program to

5935
05:30:39,040 --> 05:30:41,520
the exec ve system call such that every

5936
05:30:41,520 --> 05:30:43,680
time the exec v system call like a new

5937
05:30:43,680 --> 05:30:45,200
program is run

5938
05:30:45,200 --> 05:30:46,240
it will

5939
05:30:46,240 --> 05:30:47,760
trigger the bpf program that's

5940
05:30:47,760 --> 05:30:49,840
communicating back to your user space

5941
05:30:49,840 --> 05:30:50,878
program

5942
05:30:50,878 --> 05:30:53,040
i could show like a very quick

5943
05:30:53,040 --> 05:30:55,120
demo of that just to

5944
05:30:55,120 --> 05:30:58,239
understand the nature of it

5945
05:30:58,558 --> 05:30:59,680
doing this

5946
05:30:59,680 --> 05:31:02,160
backwards sorry

5947
05:31:02,160 --> 05:31:03,840
so

5948
05:31:03,840 --> 05:31:08,600
here i'll just i'll just open up

5949
05:31:10,000 --> 05:31:12,480
so this is this right here oh wait

5950
05:31:12,480 --> 05:31:14,718
where's my mouse uh so this right here

5951
05:31:14,718 --> 05:31:17,600
this is a bpf program all it's doing is

5952
05:31:17,600 --> 05:31:19,920
getting the command that was run

5953
05:31:19,920 --> 05:31:20,878
uh

5954
05:31:20,878 --> 05:31:22,638
that exec ve

5955
05:31:22,638 --> 05:31:25,760
uh triggered uh it's just printing it

5956
05:31:25,760 --> 05:31:27,200
out to a buffer

5957
05:31:27,200 --> 05:31:28,000
uh

5958
05:31:28,000 --> 05:31:30,000
what was run and then we have a user

5959
05:31:30,000 --> 05:31:31,680
space program that's just taken the

5960
05:31:31,680 --> 05:31:33,200
compiled version it's compiled with

5961
05:31:33,200 --> 05:31:34,798
clang

5962
05:31:34,798 --> 05:31:36,718
it's getting the program it's attaching

5963
05:31:36,718 --> 05:31:39,680
it to the exec the system call

5964
05:31:39,680 --> 05:31:43,440
and that's all it's doing i know i'm

5965
05:31:43,840 --> 05:31:45,600
speeding through this but

5966
05:31:45,600 --> 05:31:47,120
it'll be worth it

5967
05:31:47,120 --> 05:31:50,520
but essentially

5968
05:31:52,798 --> 05:31:54,480
okay so i'm running the user space

5969
05:31:54,480 --> 05:31:57,120
program that's loading the compiled bpf

5970
05:31:57,120 --> 05:31:59,520
program attaching it to exec ve

5971
05:31:59,520 --> 05:32:01,760
uh

5972
05:32:02,840 --> 05:32:05,600
and and now every time i run a program

5973
05:32:05,600 --> 05:32:07,520
like i'll run

5974
05:32:07,520 --> 05:32:10,638
slack you could see the

5975
05:32:12,000 --> 05:32:14,080
oh it was already running uh all right

5976
05:32:14,080 --> 05:32:16,718
so essentially

5977
05:32:17,360 --> 05:32:18,480
no i'm running

5978
05:32:18,480 --> 05:32:21,280
what's going on here

5979
05:32:26,558 --> 05:32:28,718
all right something is uh

5980
05:32:28,718 --> 05:32:30,798
blocking that oh

5981
05:32:30,798 --> 05:32:32,480
all right whatever it is you have a bpf

5982
05:32:32,480 --> 05:32:35,360
program that's uh attaching to bpf

5983
05:32:35,360 --> 05:32:37,520
uh or attaching to exec ve and triggered

5984
05:32:37,520 --> 05:32:40,558
every time exec ve runs

5985
05:32:40,558 --> 05:32:42,958
uh the really interesting thing uh when

5986
05:32:42,958 --> 05:32:45,040
it comes to bpf or there's a lot of

5987
05:32:45,040 --> 05:32:46,480
interesting things but something i'm

5988
05:32:46,480 --> 05:32:48,240
particularly interested in

5989
05:32:48,240 --> 05:32:50,878
uh is attaching bpf program to

5990
05:32:50,878 --> 05:32:52,000
uh

5991
05:32:52,000 --> 05:32:54,638
something called u probes so in the same

5992
05:32:54,638 --> 05:32:56,480
way that you could attach to system

5993
05:32:56,480 --> 05:32:58,400
calls or kernel functions

5994
05:32:58,400 --> 05:33:00,798
you could attach the symbols within

5995
05:33:00,798 --> 05:33:04,798
uh user space binaries so you have uh

5996
05:33:04,798 --> 05:33:07,200
you know you write a go program or any

5997
05:33:07,200 --> 05:33:09,040
compiled language

5998
05:33:09,040 --> 05:33:11,440
and all the functions that

5999
05:33:11,440 --> 05:33:12,840
are in your code

6000
05:33:12,840 --> 05:33:17,840
are become symbols within a object so

6001
05:33:17,840 --> 05:33:21,360
those symbols are

6002
05:33:21,360 --> 05:33:23,600
you know in the debug information

6003
05:33:23,600 --> 05:33:25,840
and you can attach bpf programs such

6004
05:33:25,840 --> 05:33:27,840
that every time your program is run and

6005
05:33:27,840 --> 05:33:30,558
that symbol uh

6006
05:33:30,558 --> 05:33:32,718
that symbol is touched you know as that

6007
05:33:32,718 --> 05:33:34,240
symbol is actually run

6008
05:33:34,240 --> 05:33:36,320
you could have an ebpf program run you

6009
05:33:36,320 --> 05:33:38,240
could also in the case of if the binary

6010
05:33:38,240 --> 05:33:39,520
is stripped you could attach to like a

6011
05:33:39,520 --> 05:33:41,520
raw memory

6012
05:33:41,520 --> 05:33:42,958
address

6013
05:33:42,958 --> 05:33:45,440
but we're not going to be talking about

6014
05:33:45,440 --> 05:33:48,798
that technique for the sake of this talk

6015
05:33:48,798 --> 05:33:51,440
hold on my

6016
05:33:54,240 --> 05:33:56,958
so what that looks like is

6017
05:33:56,958 --> 05:33:58,160
again if you're

6018
05:33:58,160 --> 05:34:00,160
not familiar with how this works you

6019
05:34:00,160 --> 05:34:01,920
have your source code it gets compiled

6020
05:34:01,920 --> 05:34:03,520
into a binary

6021
05:34:03,520 --> 05:34:06,000
the binary contains machine instructions

6022
05:34:06,000 --> 05:34:07,600
uh and

6023
05:34:07,600 --> 05:34:09,520
each function you know it sometimes gets

6024
05:34:09,520 --> 05:34:12,000
optimized out but each function is a

6025
05:34:12,000 --> 05:34:14,878
routine in machine code

6026
05:34:14,878 --> 05:34:19,280
so the red section over here uh is your

6027
05:34:19,280 --> 05:34:20,520
main

6028
05:34:20,520 --> 05:34:24,320
instructions for the main function and

6029
05:34:24,320 --> 05:34:26,160
they get executed one at a time one

6030
05:34:26,160 --> 05:34:28,480
after another and then at some point

6031
05:34:28,480 --> 05:34:31,040
like in this diagram we have like

6032
05:34:31,040 --> 05:34:32,400
this instruction all the way at the

6033
05:34:32,400 --> 05:34:35,600
bottom here uh is a call to another

6034
05:34:35,600 --> 05:34:36,638
routine

6035
05:34:36,638 --> 05:34:38,638
up here on the top it's called function

6036
05:34:38,638 --> 05:34:39,680
a

6037
05:34:39,680 --> 05:34:41,120
and those get

6038
05:34:41,120 --> 05:34:42,718
triggered one at a time

6039
05:34:42,718 --> 05:34:44,558
and you can attach a u probe to that

6040
05:34:44,558 --> 05:34:45,520
symbol

6041
05:34:45,520 --> 05:34:48,558
and in which case

6042
05:34:48,638 --> 05:34:51,760
when that routine is called at the top

6043
05:34:51,760 --> 05:34:53,680
it will trigger the eppf program the

6044
05:34:53,680 --> 05:34:55,920
ebpf program will

6045
05:34:55,920 --> 05:34:56,798
run

6046
05:34:56,798 --> 05:34:59,920
to completion come back and then finish

6047
05:34:59,920 --> 05:35:02,000
running the routine before it jumps back

6048
05:35:02,000 --> 05:35:03,360
to

6049
05:35:03,360 --> 05:35:05,360
where it was called from the main

6050
05:35:05,360 --> 05:35:07,840
routine

6051
05:35:09,280 --> 05:35:13,040
uh so what can we do with this uh

6052
05:35:13,040 --> 05:35:14,558
we could obviously communicate with user

6053
05:35:14,558 --> 05:35:16,558
space like uh in that example i tried to

6054
05:35:16,558 --> 05:35:18,400
show you where you know we're logging or

6055
05:35:18,400 --> 05:35:21,280
monitoring every time that a symbol is

6056
05:35:21,280 --> 05:35:23,280
executed

6057
05:35:23,280 --> 05:35:25,200
you know and this goes for

6058
05:35:25,200 --> 05:35:27,520
not just user space programs but

6059
05:35:27,520 --> 05:35:30,080
in general so for example the project i

6060
05:35:30,080 --> 05:35:32,638
work on tracy we're attaching to

6061
05:35:32,638 --> 05:35:35,680
hundreds and hundreds of different uh

6062
05:35:35,680 --> 05:35:37,680
different events within the kernel

6063
05:35:37,680 --> 05:35:40,480
various different subsystems and whatnot

6064
05:35:40,480 --> 05:35:42,958
and we're sending that to user space for

6065
05:35:42,958 --> 05:35:44,400
you know whatever you want to do with if

6066
05:35:44,400 --> 05:35:46,240
you just want to log it or you want to

6067
05:35:46,240 --> 05:35:48,798
write policy on top of that

6068
05:35:48,798 --> 05:35:51,120
which is is pretty typical use case of

6069
05:35:51,120 --> 05:35:52,080
it

6070
05:35:52,080 --> 05:35:54,718
uh we have you know ebpf programs can do

6071
05:35:54,718 --> 05:35:56,878
routing like how i mentioned cloudfair

6072
05:35:56,878 --> 05:35:59,760
cloudflare is doing uh psyllium if

6073
05:35:59,760 --> 05:36:01,120
you're if you're familiar with that for

6074
05:36:01,120 --> 05:36:02,958
kubernetes stuff

6075
05:36:02,958 --> 05:36:04,480
as well as enforcement in the case of

6076
05:36:04,480 --> 05:36:06,080
lsm hooks

6077
05:36:06,080 --> 05:36:09,040
as well as reading of raw memory so ebpf

6078
05:36:09,040 --> 05:36:11,440
programs this is a very

6079
05:36:11,440 --> 05:36:13,440
important point about this

6080
05:36:13,440 --> 05:36:17,280
is that ebpf programs run with access to

6081
05:36:17,280 --> 05:36:18,480
the entire

6082
05:36:18,480 --> 05:36:20,798
address space of the program that

6083
05:36:20,798 --> 05:36:22,320
triggered it

6084
05:36:22,320 --> 05:36:24,638
so i want to show a

6085
05:36:24,638 --> 05:36:27,280
quick example of that hopefully it will

6086
05:36:27,280 --> 05:36:31,320
work a lot better this time around

6087
05:36:32,160 --> 05:36:34,400
okay

6088
05:36:38,638 --> 05:36:39,520
okay

6089
05:36:39,520 --> 05:36:42,840
so i have this project called weaver

6090
05:36:42,840 --> 05:36:44,718
that

6091
05:36:44,718 --> 05:36:46,160
i don't actually have to go

6092
05:36:46,160 --> 05:36:48,400
into that much but essentially it lets

6093
05:36:48,400 --> 05:36:51,920
you attach a bpf program to

6094
05:36:51,920 --> 05:36:53,520
a

6095
05:36:53,520 --> 05:36:55,200
user space symbol

6096
05:36:55,200 --> 05:36:57,600
and when that user space symbol is

6097
05:36:57,600 --> 05:36:59,440
executed it's just going to dump the

6098
05:36:59,440 --> 05:37:01,840
first 50 bytes of the stack as well as

6099
05:37:01,840 --> 05:37:04,400
print out all the registers

6100
05:37:04,400 --> 05:37:06,160
at the time that that symbol was called

6101
05:37:06,160 --> 05:37:07,280
so

6102
05:37:07,280 --> 05:37:09,920
i'm going to show it running and then

6103
05:37:09,920 --> 05:37:13,839
talk a little bit more about it

6104
05:37:32,558 --> 05:37:34,958
so in this case this is the program i'm

6105
05:37:34,958 --> 05:37:37,760
attaching it to we have just a single

6106
05:37:37,760 --> 05:37:40,558
uh function called test single int

6107
05:37:40,558 --> 05:37:42,080
takes an integer

6108
05:37:42,080 --> 05:37:45,558
that's all it does

6109
05:37:56,400 --> 05:38:00,320
so now when i run it

6110
05:38:01,600 --> 05:38:05,399
uh where am i

6111
05:38:10,400 --> 05:38:13,040
so now when i run it uh

6112
05:38:13,040 --> 05:38:14,718
that function got called and we're

6113
05:38:14,718 --> 05:38:16,080
printing out the first 50 bytes of the

6114
05:38:16,080 --> 05:38:17,120
stack

6115
05:38:17,120 --> 05:38:18,958
as well as the contents of all the

6116
05:38:18,958 --> 05:38:20,798
virtual registers

6117
05:38:20,798 --> 05:38:24,718
you could see in ax so go has a register

6118
05:38:24,718 --> 05:38:26,958
based calling convention

6119
05:38:26,958 --> 05:38:29,440
ax contains the first integer

6120
05:38:29,440 --> 05:38:32,558
parameter and that has a 7 in it so we

6121
05:38:32,558 --> 05:38:35,120
have access to that raw memory so that

6122
05:38:35,120 --> 05:38:38,240
we can dump that inspect it and

6123
05:38:38,240 --> 05:38:40,558
find out what's going on within our

6124
05:38:40,558 --> 05:38:41,760
programs

6125
05:38:41,760 --> 05:38:43,520
as they're happening in a

6126
05:38:43,520 --> 05:38:47,718
very unintrusive way

6127
05:38:51,120 --> 05:38:52,638
so

6128
05:38:52,638 --> 05:38:55,280
uh what i want to talk about now that i

6129
05:38:55,280 --> 05:38:57,760
find very cool is that in addition to

6130
05:38:57,760 --> 05:39:00,080
reading of raw memory we could in the

6131
05:39:00,080 --> 05:39:03,040
case of u probes write to raw memory uh

6132
05:39:03,040 --> 05:39:04,638
so

6133
05:39:04,638 --> 05:39:06,480
in the same way that we looked at the

6134
05:39:06,480 --> 05:39:08,160
first 50 bytes of the stack and we

6135
05:39:08,160 --> 05:39:10,160
looked at all those registers

6136
05:39:10,160 --> 05:39:11,760
when the symbol was called we can

6137
05:39:11,760 --> 05:39:13,360
overwrite that

6138
05:39:13,360 --> 05:39:14,958
and we could do some very interesting

6139
05:39:14,958 --> 05:39:16,798
things so

6140
05:39:16,798 --> 05:39:19,120
i'm not going to show a demo of this but

6141
05:39:19,120 --> 05:39:20,798
you know for example if i wanted to

6142
05:39:20,798 --> 05:39:22,480
change the contents of that register so

6143
05:39:22,480 --> 05:39:25,200
that instead of passing a 7 in it would

6144
05:39:25,200 --> 05:39:27,120
i change it to an 8.

6145
05:39:27,120 --> 05:39:30,400
something silly like that

6146
05:39:30,400 --> 05:39:31,680
i don't really know how that's useful

6147
05:39:31,680 --> 05:39:33,680
like you can

6148
05:39:33,680 --> 05:39:35,920
maybe for testing or for chaos

6149
05:39:35,920 --> 05:39:37,760
engineering or just making the program

6150
05:39:37,760 --> 05:39:40,400
crash or something like that it could be

6151
05:39:40,400 --> 05:39:43,280
neat or like hot patching uh

6152
05:39:43,280 --> 05:39:45,680
uh you know code

6153
05:39:45,680 --> 05:39:46,400
in

6154
05:39:46,400 --> 05:39:48,638
production no you wouldn't do that but

6155
05:39:48,638 --> 05:39:50,958
um

6156
05:39:51,120 --> 05:39:52,558
yeah so there's some cool things that

6157
05:39:52,558 --> 05:39:54,320
you could do with it uh you know there's

6158
05:39:54,320 --> 05:39:56,718
bpf provides this helper function uh

6159
05:39:56,718 --> 05:39:57,600
called

6160
05:39:57,600 --> 05:39:59,840
bpf probe right user

6161
05:39:59,840 --> 05:40:02,000
it works very intuitively you have an

6162
05:40:02,000 --> 05:40:05,360
address that you pass you have a input

6163
05:40:05,360 --> 05:40:07,920
buffer that you pass and just the length

6164
05:40:07,920 --> 05:40:09,360
of bytes just to

6165
05:40:09,360 --> 05:40:11,920
write over into that user space memory

6166
05:40:11,920 --> 05:40:14,920
address

6167
05:40:15,600 --> 05:40:18,000
and what i find very cool

6168
05:40:18,000 --> 05:40:21,200
is you can use ebpf to manipulate the

6169
05:40:21,200 --> 05:40:24,958
execution of your program

6170
05:40:24,958 --> 05:40:27,200
whoa

6171
05:40:27,200 --> 05:40:30,240
so uh yeah like i said uh

6172
05:40:30,240 --> 05:40:33,520
this is like a baseline principle of

6173
05:40:33,520 --> 05:40:36,160
return oriented programming uh

6174
05:40:36,160 --> 05:40:38,638
so if you're not familiar uh i hope you

6175
05:40:38,638 --> 05:40:41,200
find this interesting so as machine code

6176
05:40:41,200 --> 05:40:42,718
executes

6177
05:40:42,718 --> 05:40:44,480
the program jumps from routine to

6178
05:40:44,480 --> 05:40:46,798
routine you know functions call other

6179
05:40:46,798 --> 05:40:48,000
functions

6180
05:40:48,000 --> 05:40:50,160
and the functions are correspond with

6181
05:40:50,160 --> 05:40:51,920
these machine code

6182
05:40:51,920 --> 05:40:53,200
routines

6183
05:40:53,200 --> 05:40:55,280
and when this occurs

6184
05:40:55,280 --> 05:40:57,600
you use the call instruction and the

6185
05:40:57,600 --> 05:40:59,040
call instruction

6186
05:40:59,040 --> 05:41:00,480
uh

6187
05:41:00,480 --> 05:41:02,878
the the address of that so

6188
05:41:02,878 --> 05:41:05,840
uh here i'm gonna skip to this slide uh

6189
05:41:05,840 --> 05:41:06,638
so

6190
05:41:06,638 --> 05:41:08,558
here i'm actually gonna

6191
05:41:08,558 --> 05:41:11,760
i'm gonna have more fun this time

6192
05:41:13,360 --> 05:41:17,200
oh actually i think that mike's on

6193
05:41:22,718 --> 05:41:23,440
so

6194
05:41:23,440 --> 05:41:27,520
over here this represents a call

6195
05:41:27,520 --> 05:41:30,718
a call instruction in assembly code

6196
05:41:30,718 --> 05:41:32,798
so like i said that's going to jump over

6197
05:41:32,798 --> 05:41:33,760
there

6198
05:41:33,760 --> 05:41:35,360
and when that

6199
05:41:35,360 --> 05:41:37,040
jump occurs

6200
05:41:37,040 --> 05:41:39,680
it's also saving the address like where

6201
05:41:39,680 --> 05:41:42,958
this actual instruction is so that you

6202
05:41:42,958 --> 05:41:45,600
know when this last instruction is

6203
05:41:45,600 --> 05:41:46,718
called

6204
05:41:46,718 --> 05:41:49,120
it can jump back over here so like this

6205
05:41:49,120 --> 05:41:51,120
would be a return instruction this is

6206
05:41:51,120 --> 05:41:53,200
the call it jumps back so that

6207
05:41:53,200 --> 05:41:55,040
after this is done we're going to start

6208
05:41:55,040 --> 05:41:57,360
executing this instruction here

6209
05:41:57,360 --> 05:41:59,840
so it's saving that by loading it onto

6210
05:41:59,840 --> 05:42:01,440
the top of the stack

6211
05:42:01,440 --> 05:42:05,239
like loading that address

6212
05:42:08,000 --> 05:42:11,120
uh but with bpf uh or you know any other

6213
05:42:11,120 --> 05:42:12,958
traditional technique that people have

6214
05:42:12,958 --> 05:42:15,440
been doing for the past 30 years you can

6215
05:42:15,440 --> 05:42:17,680
overwrite that saved address to change

6216
05:42:17,680 --> 05:42:20,480
where the routine actually

6217
05:42:20,480 --> 05:42:23,120
returns to

6218
05:42:28,480 --> 05:42:31,360
so i'm gonna i'm gonna show this running

6219
05:42:31,360 --> 05:42:32,480
but

6220
05:42:32,480 --> 05:42:34,958
ebpf programs are run before the

6221
05:42:34,958 --> 05:42:36,638
function they're attached to

6222
05:42:36,638 --> 05:42:38,320
so we have access to the stack and we

6223
05:42:38,320 --> 05:42:40,240
can write to it

6224
05:42:40,240 --> 05:42:41,840
so

6225
05:42:41,840 --> 05:42:42,798
the

6226
05:42:42,798 --> 05:42:44,958
what this bpf program is doing is it's

6227
05:42:44,958 --> 05:42:47,120
taking the address of

6228
05:42:47,120 --> 05:42:49,280
the top of the stack when that

6229
05:42:49,280 --> 05:42:51,440
routine is when we enter into the stack

6230
05:42:51,440 --> 05:42:53,040
frame for that routine

6231
05:42:53,040 --> 05:42:54,558
we're reading that

6232
05:42:54,558 --> 05:42:56,480
finding the address of it

6233
05:42:56,480 --> 05:42:57,760
and

6234
05:42:57,760 --> 05:43:00,558
we're writing to the top of the stack

6235
05:43:00,558 --> 05:43:02,558
the instruction pointer which is

6236
05:43:02,558 --> 05:43:04,558
pointing to the top of the routine that

6237
05:43:04,558 --> 05:43:06,798
i just entered into so

6238
05:43:06,798 --> 05:43:09,280
when we're popping the base address

6239
05:43:09,280 --> 05:43:10,958
which is

6240
05:43:10,958 --> 05:43:12,718
so essentially we're

6241
05:43:12,718 --> 05:43:14,718
popping the return address

6242
05:43:14,718 --> 05:43:15,920
at the end

6243
05:43:15,920 --> 05:43:17,120
when we finish

6244
05:43:17,120 --> 05:43:19,360
running that routine and we've set that

6245
05:43:19,360 --> 05:43:21,520
to be the top of the routine

6246
05:43:21,520 --> 05:43:22,878
so

6247
05:43:22,878 --> 05:43:25,840
what this is going to do

6248
05:43:25,920 --> 05:43:27,840
let's see

6249
05:43:27,840 --> 05:43:31,240
let me find

6250
05:43:31,360 --> 05:43:32,400
this

6251
05:43:32,400 --> 05:43:34,718
here

6252
05:43:42,080 --> 05:43:44,558
okay so uh

6253
05:43:44,558 --> 05:43:47,440
in that same

6254
05:43:47,440 --> 05:43:49,280
tool that i told you about or first

6255
05:43:49,280 --> 05:43:52,000
we're gonna run

6256
05:43:54,558 --> 05:43:56,400
uh

6257
05:43:56,400 --> 05:43:59,400
whoops

6258
05:44:01,680 --> 05:44:03,600
okay so we have this

6259
05:44:03,600 --> 05:44:05,840
program that all it does is it calls a

6260
05:44:05,840 --> 05:44:09,440
function that prints out today's date

6261
05:44:09,600 --> 05:44:13,840
now what we can do and here i can even

6262
05:44:16,080 --> 05:44:18,480
right so all this is doing is

6263
05:44:18,480 --> 05:44:20,480
calling test print something test print

6264
05:44:20,480 --> 05:44:21,920
something

6265
05:44:21,920 --> 05:44:23,520
is sleeping for a second and then

6266
05:44:23,520 --> 05:44:27,400
printing the date

6267
05:44:27,600 --> 05:44:28,400
so

6268
05:44:28,400 --> 05:44:31,440
what we can do is

6269
05:44:31,440 --> 05:44:33,440
we can

6270
05:44:33,440 --> 05:44:35,120
run weaver

6271
05:44:35,120 --> 05:44:37,680
repeat

6272
05:44:38,798 --> 05:44:41,200
uh we're gonna pass the

6273
05:44:41,200 --> 05:44:42,638
binary and we're gonna pass the name of

6274
05:44:42,638 --> 05:44:44,798
the

6275
05:44:47,718 --> 05:44:51,798
symbol uh

6276
05:44:58,480 --> 05:45:02,718
okay so that's just sitting and waiting

6277
05:45:02,798 --> 05:45:06,000
and now when we run

6278
05:45:06,000 --> 05:45:08,558
our simple print program

6279
05:45:08,558 --> 05:45:11,360
instead of returning after running that

6280
05:45:11,360 --> 05:45:13,200
function it's just going to keep

6281
05:45:13,200 --> 05:45:16,160
repeating itself over and over again

6282
05:45:16,160 --> 05:45:18,240
until eventually crashing like it does

6283
05:45:18,240 --> 05:45:20,718
in the movie

6284
05:45:20,718 --> 05:45:22,798
it was a groundhog day reference

6285
05:45:22,798 --> 05:45:24,000
okay

6286
05:45:24,000 --> 05:45:27,600
so once we turn off the bpf program

6287
05:45:27,600 --> 05:45:30,320
uh it goes back to normal

6288
05:45:30,320 --> 05:45:33,320
repeating

6289
05:45:38,638 --> 05:45:40,160
normal

6290
05:45:40,160 --> 05:45:42,160
thank you

6291
05:45:42,160 --> 05:45:45,280
uh okay so there are more useful

6292
05:45:45,280 --> 05:45:48,558
uh more exciting things to do

6293
05:45:48,558 --> 05:45:50,878
than this so i was going to

6294
05:45:50,878 --> 05:45:53,680
uh show a demo that i had written that

6295
05:45:53,680 --> 05:45:55,840
was probably also equally as lame as

6296
05:45:55,840 --> 05:45:58,080
that last one but this week

6297
05:45:58,080 --> 05:45:59,680
i found on twitter this really cool

6298
05:45:59,680 --> 05:46:01,840
project called triple cross

6299
05:46:01,840 --> 05:46:04,320
and essentially it's uh doing something

6300
05:46:04,320 --> 05:46:05,680
a lot more

6301
05:46:05,680 --> 05:46:07,440
uh

6302
05:46:07,440 --> 05:46:09,200
interesting is the word that i that i

6303
05:46:09,200 --> 05:46:12,878
chose uh instead of useful uh

6304
05:46:12,878 --> 05:46:13,600
for

6305
05:46:13,600 --> 05:46:15,920
using this exact uh like helper function

6306
05:46:15,920 --> 05:46:18,480
and bpf programs to do what i did

6307
05:46:18,480 --> 05:46:19,840
so instead of just repeating the

6308
05:46:19,840 --> 05:46:21,360
function it's

6309
05:46:21,360 --> 05:46:24,160
like finding a code cave within the

6310
05:46:24,160 --> 05:46:27,520
loaded program in memory it's

6311
05:46:27,520 --> 05:46:28,878
writing to that

6312
05:46:28,878 --> 05:46:30,400
with shell code

6313
05:46:30,400 --> 05:46:31,520
it's

6314
05:46:31,520 --> 05:46:34,878
saving the global offset table entry

6315
05:46:34,878 --> 05:46:36,320
address so that

6316
05:46:36,320 --> 05:46:38,160
it can overwrite

6317
05:46:38,160 --> 05:46:40,320
the return address so that instead of

6318
05:46:40,320 --> 05:46:41,600
returning

6319
05:46:41,600 --> 05:46:43,360
after it

6320
05:46:43,360 --> 05:46:45,280
essentially instead of jumping to a

6321
05:46:45,280 --> 05:46:47,200
another

6322
05:46:47,200 --> 05:46:49,120
jumping back to the same function

6323
05:46:49,120 --> 05:46:49,920
it's

6324
05:46:49,920 --> 05:46:52,958
jumping into shell code

6325
05:46:52,958 --> 05:46:54,558
so i'm not going to go too deep into

6326
05:46:54,558 --> 05:46:57,280
this because this talk isn't just about

6327
05:46:57,280 --> 05:46:58,798
you know

6328
05:46:58,798 --> 05:47:00,160
those type of attacks we're talking

6329
05:47:00,160 --> 05:47:01,760
about evpf

6330
05:47:01,760 --> 05:47:03,680
but i do recommend checking it out if

6331
05:47:03,680 --> 05:47:04,798
you want to actually find something

6332
05:47:04,798 --> 05:47:05,840
useful

6333
05:47:05,840 --> 05:47:08,320
to do with bpf related to this

6334
05:47:08,320 --> 05:47:09,760
shout out to

6335
05:47:09,760 --> 05:47:11,040
hex duck

6336
05:47:11,040 --> 05:47:13,760
for writing that marcos bajo

6337
05:47:13,760 --> 05:47:15,520
here's a really cool diagram there's a

6338
05:47:15,520 --> 05:47:18,160
lot of docs and uh like he had it's like

6339
05:47:18,160 --> 05:47:20,000
a it was like a research product of his

6340
05:47:20,000 --> 05:47:22,558
uh or thesis so

6341
05:47:22,558 --> 05:47:24,718
there's a lot of really awesome learning

6342
05:47:24,718 --> 05:47:26,718
material uh the link is at the back of

6343
05:47:26,718 --> 05:47:28,558
my slides which is on my website

6344
05:47:28,558 --> 05:47:29,920
i'll tell you about it after but i do

6345
05:47:29,920 --> 05:47:32,638
recommend checking that out

6346
05:47:32,638 --> 05:47:34,878
uh so what makes ebpf unique like the

6347
05:47:34,878 --> 05:47:36,480
code injection and return-oriented

6348
05:47:36,480 --> 05:47:38,240
programming is not unique to evpf i'm

6349
05:47:38,240 --> 05:47:39,920
not presenting anything new i'm sure a

6350
05:47:39,920 --> 05:47:41,520
lot of you are like

6351
05:47:41,520 --> 05:47:44,400
like what's going on so

6352
05:47:44,400 --> 05:47:47,200
ebpf is a very

6353
05:47:47,200 --> 05:47:48,958
unique technology

6354
05:47:48,958 --> 05:47:51,199
that

6355
05:47:51,600 --> 05:47:53,840
makes all this a lot easier and a lot a

6356
05:47:53,840 --> 05:47:55,200
lot cooler

6357
05:47:55,200 --> 05:47:56,558
so

6358
05:47:56,558 --> 05:47:58,558
the first the first point uh that i want

6359
05:47:58,558 --> 05:48:00,320
to talk about is that ebpf is a lot more

6360
05:48:00,320 --> 05:48:02,240
portable than let's say like a kernel

6361
05:48:02,240 --> 05:48:04,558
module or let's say

6362
05:48:04,558 --> 05:48:05,760
uh

6363
05:48:05,760 --> 05:48:08,080
yeah like let's say a kernel module uh

6364
05:48:08,080 --> 05:48:10,240
the ecosystem is brand new it's easy to

6365
05:48:10,240 --> 05:48:12,240
write it's really cool it's the new hot

6366
05:48:12,240 --> 05:48:13,920
[ __ ]

6367
05:48:13,920 --> 05:48:16,400
uh but in particular you know the fact

6368
05:48:16,400 --> 05:48:17,760
that it's portable

6369
05:48:17,760 --> 05:48:20,080
so today's ebpf programs are compiled

6370
05:48:20,080 --> 05:48:21,840
once and run everywhere you don't have

6371
05:48:21,840 --> 05:48:26,320
to write your ebpf code to specifically

6372
05:48:26,320 --> 05:48:28,240
reference offsets

6373
05:48:28,240 --> 05:48:31,360
for a specific compile kernel

6374
05:48:31,360 --> 05:48:33,600
or a specific

6375
05:48:33,600 --> 05:48:36,080
line of kernels like you know this will

6376
05:48:36,080 --> 05:48:38,080
you know this kernel module will work

6377
05:48:38,080 --> 05:48:39,040
for

6378
05:48:39,040 --> 05:48:41,200
red hat enterprise linux

6379
05:48:41,200 --> 05:48:44,638
7.1 through 7.3.2

6380
05:48:44,638 --> 05:48:47,040
or things like that evpf code can be

6381
05:48:47,040 --> 05:48:48,558
fully portable

6382
05:48:48,558 --> 05:48:50,958
using

6383
05:48:51,120 --> 05:48:53,200
new developments in something called btf

6384
05:48:53,200 --> 05:48:55,760
so essentially the linux kernel

6385
05:48:55,760 --> 05:48:59,120
will provide uh debug information uh for

6386
05:48:59,120 --> 05:49:02,240
all the symbols and stuff that it has

6387
05:49:02,240 --> 05:49:03,360
and

6388
05:49:03,360 --> 05:49:05,600
lib bpf has

6389
05:49:05,600 --> 05:49:06,400
these

6390
05:49:06,400 --> 05:49:07,440
cool

6391
05:49:07,440 --> 05:49:09,280
algorithms that will look through all of

6392
05:49:09,280 --> 05:49:12,240
that and when you reference a particular

6393
05:49:12,240 --> 05:49:14,558
um

6394
05:49:14,558 --> 05:49:16,400
let's say like a particular that used to

6395
05:49:16,400 --> 05:49:18,638
be like a huge pain in the butt to deal

6396
05:49:18,638 --> 05:49:21,600
with uh and even if your linux kernel

6397
05:49:21,600 --> 05:49:24,558
doesn't expose btf uh

6398
05:49:24,558 --> 05:49:25,680
uh my

6399
05:49:25,680 --> 05:49:27,600
co-worker along with uh some people

6400
05:49:27,600 --> 05:49:29,040
within the community uh worked on

6401
05:49:29,040 --> 05:49:31,120
something called btf hub uh that lets

6402
05:49:31,120 --> 05:49:35,600
you embed that debug information for uh

6403
05:49:35,600 --> 05:49:38,080
pretty much any any kernel that's been

6404
05:49:38,080 --> 05:49:39,760
out in the public

6405
05:49:39,760 --> 05:49:41,760
and

6406
05:49:41,760 --> 05:49:43,760
you know find it for the running kernel

6407
05:49:43,760 --> 05:49:45,760
and not have to worry about depending on

6408
05:49:45,760 --> 05:49:49,280
the on the kernel itself uh so

6409
05:49:49,280 --> 05:49:50,958
you could have a fully static binary you

6410
05:49:50,958 --> 05:49:54,240
embed the bpf code you embed the btf uh

6411
05:49:54,240 --> 05:49:56,718
information uh don't depend on any

6412
05:49:56,718 --> 05:49:58,718
external dependency and you have this

6413
05:49:58,718 --> 05:50:01,040
just one single object that you can drop

6414
05:50:01,040 --> 05:50:02,958
on a machine and you know that it's

6415
05:50:02,958 --> 05:50:04,320
going to work and you know it's going to

6416
05:50:04,320 --> 05:50:06,878
be able to inspect like really uh like a

6417
05:50:06,878 --> 05:50:09,200
ton of like in-depth information about

6418
05:50:09,200 --> 05:50:12,000
uh the kernel in memory as well as you

6419
05:50:12,000 --> 05:50:14,160
know for targeting specific binaries and

6420
05:50:14,160 --> 05:50:17,680
things like that on the machine

6421
05:50:17,680 --> 05:50:19,920
so

6422
05:50:20,000 --> 05:50:21,600
that's pretty cool as well as the

6423
05:50:21,600 --> 05:50:24,320
ecosystem is brand new uh and everywhere

6424
05:50:24,320 --> 05:50:26,638
so ebpf has a lot of legitimate use

6425
05:50:26,638 --> 05:50:29,200
cases uh on almost all modern cloud

6426
05:50:29,200 --> 05:50:31,200
servers so

6427
05:50:31,200 --> 05:50:33,120
you can't just you know at my last job

6428
05:50:33,120 --> 05:50:34,320
like we just turned off all kernel

6429
05:50:34,320 --> 05:50:36,000
modules because we weren't going to ever

6430
05:50:36,000 --> 05:50:38,160
run kernel modules and maybe if we did

6431
05:50:38,160 --> 05:50:39,760
they were signed

6432
05:50:39,760 --> 05:50:42,160
there's no

6433
05:50:42,558 --> 05:50:44,638
signed bpf programs yet it's a lot more

6434
05:50:44,638 --> 05:50:47,360
complicated than kernel modules because

6435
05:50:47,360 --> 05:50:50,160
just the nature of bpf uh one the way

6436
05:50:50,160 --> 05:50:51,840
that it's loaded into

6437
05:50:51,840 --> 05:50:53,600
the

6438
05:50:53,600 --> 05:50:55,280
alpha object that

6439
05:50:55,280 --> 05:50:58,160
bpf objects are or bpf code is compiled

6440
05:50:58,160 --> 05:51:01,120
into uh makes it difficult uh as well as

6441
05:51:01,120 --> 05:51:02,798
just the nature of it like there's a

6442
05:51:02,798 --> 05:51:04,878
very cool project called pixi that is

6443
05:51:04,878 --> 05:51:07,760
taking uh you can write like very small

6444
05:51:07,760 --> 05:51:09,760
expressions and it

6445
05:51:09,760 --> 05:51:11,760
basically generates bpf code for you and

6446
05:51:11,760 --> 05:51:13,920
distributes it to a lot of machines so

6447
05:51:13,920 --> 05:51:15,920
that doesn't lend itself well to being

6448
05:51:15,920 --> 05:51:18,558
uh being signed and even if it did

6449
05:51:18,558 --> 05:51:21,040
there's no bpf signing yet

6450
05:51:21,040 --> 05:51:22,878
so

6451
05:51:22,878 --> 05:51:24,878
yeah so you're not going to disable bpf

6452
05:51:24,878 --> 05:51:27,440
because it's ubiquitous at this point

6453
05:51:27,440 --> 05:51:28,480
and

6454
05:51:28,480 --> 05:51:30,798
you're not you don't have signing for it

6455
05:51:30,798 --> 05:51:33,360
uh detection isn't easy or it's just

6456
05:51:33,360 --> 05:51:35,840
like the same conventional uh

6457
05:51:35,840 --> 05:51:38,878
ways of detecting that you have like

6458
05:51:38,878 --> 05:51:40,558
memory attacks so

6459
05:51:40,558 --> 05:51:43,360
suspicious access to proc pid mem or

6460
05:51:43,360 --> 05:51:44,878
mprotect mmap

6461
05:51:44,878 --> 05:51:47,760
uh when it comes to like finding

6462
05:51:47,760 --> 05:51:50,080
uh bpf programs you could use bpf tool

6463
05:51:50,080 --> 05:51:52,558
that's part of the linux project

6464
05:51:52,558 --> 05:51:55,280
for listing your running bpf programs

6465
05:51:55,280 --> 05:51:57,200
in the case of that helper function i

6466
05:51:57,200 --> 05:52:00,638
showed you for writing to user memory

6467
05:52:00,638 --> 05:52:02,400
that gets logged to

6468
05:52:02,400 --> 05:52:04,638
the kernel

6469
05:52:04,638 --> 05:52:05,440
log

6470
05:52:05,440 --> 05:52:08,718
buffer proc k message uh

6471
05:52:08,718 --> 05:52:10,958
and shout out to the

6472
05:52:10,958 --> 05:52:12,638
my team and the project i'm working on

6473
05:52:12,638 --> 05:52:15,760
tracy for uh detecting any kind of these

6474
05:52:15,760 --> 05:52:17,920
machines or any of these type of attacks

6475
05:52:17,920 --> 05:52:18,638
that

6476
05:52:18,638 --> 05:52:22,000
uh that it can by default

6477
05:52:22,000 --> 05:52:22,958
um

6478
05:52:22,958 --> 05:52:24,798
yeah so

6479
05:52:24,798 --> 05:52:26,798
these links are uh

6480
05:52:26,798 --> 05:52:28,320
you know the sites are gonna be

6481
05:52:28,320 --> 05:52:30,160
available on my website it's uh

6482
05:52:30,160 --> 05:52:31,920
grant.pizza

6483
05:52:31,920 --> 05:52:34,000
so you can find that a lot of uh

6484
05:52:34,000 --> 05:52:35,920
interesting stuff that i'm kind of just

6485
05:52:35,920 --> 05:52:38,400
talking about work that other people did

6486
05:52:38,400 --> 05:52:39,680
so yeah you can find me on twitter and

6487
05:52:39,680 --> 05:52:42,160
github it's just grant seltzer and uh

6488
05:52:42,160 --> 05:52:45,350
thank you so much

6489
05:52:45,350 --> 05:52:52,000
[Applause]

6490
05:52:52,000 --> 05:52:55,558
are there any questions

6491
05:53:07,280 --> 05:53:09,120
uh so the question was

6492
05:53:09,120 --> 05:53:11,600
uh about how u probes like under the

6493
05:53:11,600 --> 05:53:13,440
hood work uh

6494
05:53:13,440 --> 05:53:15,120
it's i believe i believe the way it

6495
05:53:15,120 --> 05:53:16,798
works is like there's

6496
05:53:16,798 --> 05:53:19,798
uh

6497
05:53:20,798 --> 05:53:22,878
so it's it's not overwriting anything i

6498
05:53:22,878 --> 05:53:25,280
believe that uh

6499
05:53:25,280 --> 05:53:27,440
i like i i know with with like k-probes

6500
05:53:27,440 --> 05:53:29,760
and stuff there's like

6501
05:53:29,760 --> 05:53:32,240
uh like no operation knobs or however

6502
05:53:32,240 --> 05:53:34,718
it's pronounced uh that get over in or

6503
05:53:34,718 --> 05:53:36,160
it uses uh

6504
05:53:36,160 --> 05:53:39,200
what's the word uh

6505
05:53:39,200 --> 05:53:40,558
function

6506
05:53:40,558 --> 05:53:42,718
f f trace or something like that uh

6507
05:53:42,718 --> 05:53:44,638
where it does that i i don't know under

6508
05:53:44,638 --> 05:53:45,680
the hood how it works it's definitely

6509
05:53:45,680 --> 05:53:47,280
not overwriting any instructions or

6510
05:53:47,280 --> 05:53:48,638
anything like that and it's not

6511
05:53:48,638 --> 05:53:50,000
overwriting

6512
05:53:50,000 --> 05:53:51,760
anything in the binary or anything of

6513
05:53:51,760 --> 05:53:53,440
that nature so it's like if you were to

6514
05:53:53,440 --> 05:53:54,878
attach a u probe and then delete the

6515
05:53:54,878 --> 05:53:56,480
binary

6516
05:53:56,480 --> 05:54:00,480
and recreate it uh

6517
05:54:00,480 --> 05:54:02,320
it wouldn't you know there there's no

6518
05:54:02,320 --> 05:54:04,000
difference in the binaries at all that i

6519
05:54:04,000 --> 05:54:05,920
know i know it wouldn't work

6520
05:54:05,920 --> 05:54:07,680
uh you know like the uprobe wouldn't

6521
05:54:07,680 --> 05:54:10,000
still be attached even if the the ebpf

6522
05:54:10,000 --> 05:54:12,878
program is still running um

6523
05:54:12,878 --> 05:54:14,718
i'm not exactly sure it might be like

6524
05:54:14,718 --> 05:54:18,160
somewhere in the exact ve code

6525
05:54:20,958 --> 05:54:23,600
no no uh ebpf is like completely

6526
05:54:23,600 --> 05:54:26,160
unintrusive like your program would

6527
05:54:26,160 --> 05:54:29,040
never know that it's being attached by

6528
05:54:29,040 --> 05:54:30,638
bpf code like there's nothing like

6529
05:54:30,638 --> 05:54:33,920
p-trace or anything like that

6530
05:54:34,480 --> 05:54:37,878
yeah thank you

6531
05:54:52,240 --> 05:54:53,680
uh so yeah the question was can you

6532
05:54:53,680 --> 05:54:56,080
attach to other symbols besides

6533
05:54:56,080 --> 05:54:57,600
functions like stack data or anything

6534
05:54:57,600 --> 05:54:58,480
like that

6535
05:54:58,480 --> 05:55:00,798
uh i don't know about stack data but i

6536
05:55:00,798 --> 05:55:02,638
know that you could attach to any memory

6537
05:55:02,638 --> 05:55:04,958
addressed in like dot text or any

6538
05:55:04,958 --> 05:55:06,878
executable

6539
05:55:06,878 --> 05:55:09,440
as well as like

6540
05:55:09,440 --> 05:55:12,000
you can attach to like uh access to

6541
05:55:12,000 --> 05:55:13,760
variables and things like that

6542
05:55:13,760 --> 05:55:15,760
uh i don't know about like stack

6543
05:55:15,760 --> 05:55:18,240
addresses since it's dynamic

6544
05:55:18,240 --> 05:55:22,160
oh static yes yeah yeah for sure

6545
05:55:22,160 --> 05:55:24,878
anything else all right thank you so

6546
05:55:24,878 --> 05:55:27,040
much

6547
05:55:27,140 --> 05:55:33,840
[Applause]

6548
05:55:33,840 --> 05:55:37,680
all right um so when i was 18

6549
05:55:37,680 --> 05:55:40,878
i met phil zimmerman at defcon 2.

6550
05:55:40,878 --> 05:55:43,440
um and along with two writers from the

6551
05:55:43,440 --> 05:55:46,558
now defunct mondo 2000 magazine had one

6552
05:55:46,558 --> 05:55:48,878
of the most profoundly weird nights of

6553
05:55:48,878 --> 05:55:50,798
my life

6554
05:55:50,798 --> 05:55:52,718
that's from back when pgp was still a

6555
05:55:52,718 --> 05:55:54,240
munition

6556
05:55:54,240 --> 05:55:55,360
um

6557
05:55:55,360 --> 05:55:57,920
anyway um i won't be recounting any of

6558
05:55:57,920 --> 05:55:59,920
the details of that night for our live

6559
05:55:59,920 --> 05:56:02,400
stream audience uh but you know maybe

6560
05:56:02,400 --> 05:56:04,878
you can ask me at the bar uh for some

6561
05:56:04,878 --> 05:56:06,718
some some thoughts on that

6562
05:56:06,718 --> 05:56:09,760
um our next presenter is gonna share

6563
05:56:09,760 --> 05:56:11,280
some of his own

6564
05:56:11,280 --> 05:56:13,440
uh opinions about the weirdness that is

6565
05:56:13,440 --> 05:56:15,040
pgp

6566
05:56:15,040 --> 05:56:17,520

um

6586
05:59:01,840 --> 05:59:02,878
i can share the slides if there's

6587
05:59:02,878 --> 05:59:06,120
another computer

6588
05:59:27,520 --> 05:59:30,600

05:59:59,040 --> 06:00:00,798
see that looks good

6593
06:00:00,798 --> 06:00:02,878
that looks right

6594
06:00:02,878 --> 06:00:05,200
yeah what a what a time to be alive

6595

6596
06:00:07,680 --> 06:00:10,240

6599
06:00:16,000 --> 06:00:17,680
okay uh

6600
06:00:17,680 --> 06:00:20,000
my name is will uh and i'm here to uh

6601
06:00:20,000 --> 06:00:22,480
disrespect pgp so the next 30 minutes of

6602
06:00:22,480 --> 06:00:23,840
this talk are going to be

6603
06:00:23,840 --> 06:00:25,360
unrepenting disrespect towards the thing

6604
06:00:25,360 --> 06:00:27,200
that i think i think should be have been

6605
06:00:27,200 --> 06:00:29,920
in the grave uh 20 years ago

6606
06:00:29,920 --> 06:00:32,958
uh yeah and that's my deets um so

6607
06:00:32,958 --> 06:00:34,718
uh just to just to do like a grand

6608
06:00:34,718 --> 06:00:37,040
highlight uh pgp is bad it's real

6609
06:00:37,040 --> 06:00:38,718
[ __ ] bad uh none of you in this

6610
06:00:38,718 --> 06:00:40,400
audience should be using it uh any of

6611
06:00:40,400 --> 06:00:42,400
you who do use it you are bad i don't

6612
06:00:42,400 --> 06:00:43,600
like you

6613
06:00:43,600 --> 06:00:46,400
okay uh you you think oh i can fix him

6614
06:00:46,400 --> 06:00:49,040
no you can't you're not good enough

6615
06:00:49,040 --> 06:00:50,240
and i'm gonna tell you what you can do

6616
06:00:50,240 --> 06:00:52,000
instead at the end of this talk uh but

6617
06:00:52,000 --> 06:00:54,480
tldr those are what you can use instead

6618
06:00:54,480 --> 06:00:55,600
so uh

6619
06:00:55,600 --> 06:00:56,958
just uh for those of you who don't know

6620
06:00:56,958 --> 06:00:58,240
here's your quick uh five second

6621
06:00:58,240 --> 06:01:01,200
refresher on pgp pgp is short for pretty

6622
06:01:01,200 --> 06:01:03,600
good privacy uh and the things that it's

6623
06:01:03,600 --> 06:01:04,558
it's claimed to be good for it's going

6624
06:01:04,558 --> 06:01:06,240
to be good for a whole lot of things but

6625
06:01:06,240 --> 06:01:07,920
uh the main things people use it for are

6626
06:01:07,920 --> 06:01:09,200
email encryption we'll see why that's

6627
06:01:09,200 --> 06:01:10,958
[ __ ] uh authenticated channels we'll

6628
06:01:10,958 --> 06:01:12,400
also see why that's [ __ ] and then

6629
06:01:12,400 --> 06:01:13,760
finally digital signing and we'll see

6630
06:01:13,760 --> 06:01:14,798
that nobody actually gives a [ __ ] when

6631
06:01:14,798 --> 06:01:16,718
you digitally sign things with pgp

6632
06:01:16,718 --> 06:01:18,480
uh so historically there's been a few

6633
06:01:18,480 --> 06:01:20,400
key features of pgp one of them is the

6634
06:01:20,400 --> 06:01:21,920
the web of trust uh we'll see that

6635
06:01:21,920 --> 06:01:23,520
nobody actually uses it anymore and in

6636
06:01:23,520 --> 06:01:25,600
fact it's been disabled in gnupg since

6637
06:01:25,600 --> 06:01:28,558
like 2017 because it's been attacked um

6638
06:01:28,558 --> 06:01:29,840
and then the other thing that it's cool

6639
06:01:29,840 --> 06:01:31,200
for is there's a historical museum of

6640
06:01:31,200 --> 06:01:33,200
terrible [ __ ] crypto uh everything in

6641
06:01:33,200 --> 06:01:34,480
it is basically broken and everything

6642
06:01:34,480 --> 06:01:35,680
you can use that's good in it isn't

6643
06:01:35,680 --> 06:01:36,958
standard so you shouldn't be able to use

6644
06:01:36,958 --> 06:01:39,600
it in standard channels uh and then it's

6645
06:01:39,600 --> 06:01:41,040
you know standardizing this rfc which

6646
06:01:41,040 --> 06:01:42,320
i'll talk about you know how exactly

6647
06:01:42,320 --> 06:01:44,320
awful it is um so yeah let's talk a

6648
06:01:44,320 --> 06:01:47,520
little bit about the crypto in uh pgp uh

6649
06:01:47,520 --> 06:01:50,160
so pgp is from 1991 and like almost

6650
06:01:50,160 --> 06:01:51,760
everything else from 1991 it's really

6651
06:01:51,760 --> 06:01:53,680
good uh so i think you'll probably

6652
06:01:53,680 --> 06:01:55,600
remember crystal pepsi you remember when

6653
06:01:55,600 --> 06:01:57,040
george bush vomited on the prime

6654
06:01:57,040 --> 06:01:59,280
minister of japan uh the soviet union

6655
06:01:59,280 --> 06:02:01,600
fell that was really good uh and uh the

6656
06:02:01,600 --> 06:02:03,360
gulf war happened uh so you know great

6657
06:02:03,360 --> 06:02:05,120
things pgp has a great track record for

6658
06:02:05,120 --> 06:02:06,160
its year

6659
06:02:06,160 --> 06:02:07,040
um

6660
06:02:07,040 --> 06:02:09,200
pgp is best known for being standardized

6661
06:02:09,200 --> 06:02:11,360
in this rrc which actually came out 17

6662
06:02:11,360 --> 06:02:13,760
years after it was created so for 17

6663
06:02:13,760 --> 06:02:16,400
years it wasn't standardized uh this p

6664
06:02:16,400 --> 06:02:19,440
this rfc uh sets the baseline for uh

6665
06:02:19,440 --> 06:02:21,280
basically how pgp

6666
06:02:21,280 --> 06:02:23,680
implementations interoperate uh and it's

6667
06:02:23,680 --> 06:02:24,958
basically a graveyard of everything

6668
06:02:24,958 --> 06:02:25,920
that's wrong with historical

6669
06:02:25,920 --> 06:02:28,400
cryptography it was uh despite being

6670
06:02:28,400 --> 06:02:30,240
standardized in 2007 at which point we

6671
06:02:30,240 --> 06:02:31,680
already knew what good cryptography

6672
06:02:31,680 --> 06:02:33,280
looked like it's a

6673
06:02:33,280 --> 06:02:34,320
uh

6674
06:02:34,320 --> 06:02:35,760
evolutionary dead end of everything

6675
06:02:35,760 --> 06:02:38,320
that's wrong with aes standards uh

6676
06:02:38,320 --> 06:02:40,080
things that are pre-aes

6677
06:02:40,080 --> 06:02:43,120
uh symmetric ciphers and uh hash ciphers

6678
06:02:43,120 --> 06:02:44,718
uh so on the public key side you have

6679
06:02:44,718 --> 06:02:46,320
three standard choices for for public

6680
06:02:46,320 --> 06:02:49,920
keys in pgp you have rsa which [ __ ] rsa

6681
06:02:49,920 --> 06:02:52,798
uh you have elgamal

6682
06:02:52,798 --> 06:02:54,718
yeah throwback uh you have elgamal we'll

6683
06:02:54,718 --> 06:02:56,160
go into exactly why algal is really

6684
06:02:56,160 --> 06:02:57,920
[ __ ] weird and not a good choice and

6685
06:02:57,920 --> 06:02:59,680
finally you have dsa which i don't think

6686
06:02:59,680 --> 06:03:01,200
anybody in this audience has used dsa in

6687
06:03:01,200 --> 06:03:03,920
20 years uh

6688
06:03:03,920 --> 06:03:06,558
oh no that's terrible uh on the

6689
06:03:06,558 --> 06:03:08,400
symmetric side you have idea which is a

6690
06:03:08,400 --> 06:03:10,480
weird 1990s obsolete replacement for

6691
06:03:10,480 --> 06:03:12,480
triple dash or deaths uh you have triple

6692
06:03:12,480 --> 06:03:14,400
desks which your bank loves you should

6693
06:03:14,400 --> 06:03:16,958
not love uh you have cast five which is

6694
06:03:16,958 --> 06:03:19,040
the official cipher of canada

6695
06:03:19,040 --> 06:03:21,600
uh and then you have blowfish deprecated

6696
06:03:21,600 --> 06:03:23,120
suite 32

6697
06:03:23,120 --> 06:03:24,160
and then you have two fish which is like

6698
06:03:24,160 --> 06:03:25,440
maybe okay but nobody's done encrypt

6699
06:03:25,440 --> 06:03:27,200
analysis on it in 20 years and then

6700
06:03:27,200 --> 06:03:29,200
finally you have aes which is actually

6701
06:03:29,200 --> 06:03:31,200
good but it's optional so you can't rely

6702
06:03:31,200 --> 06:03:33,040
on it when you're encrypting with pgp

6703
06:03:33,040 --> 06:03:34,400
which [ __ ] sucks because it's the

6704
06:03:34,400 --> 06:03:36,160
only good one in this list

6705
06:03:36,160 --> 06:03:37,120
um and then there's a couple of

6706
06:03:37,120 --> 06:03:38,798
extension rfcs but the thing about these

6707
06:03:38,798 --> 06:03:40,080
other extensions is that they're

6708
06:03:40,080 --> 06:03:42,160
completely optional so if you want to

6709
06:03:42,160 --> 06:03:44,000
interoperate in the open pgp ecosystem

6710
06:03:44,000 --> 06:03:47,040
you have to use rsa plus cast five

6711
06:03:47,040 --> 06:03:50,160
that's your strongest choice so rsa [ __ ]

6712
06:03:50,160 --> 06:03:52,160
plus cast five a weird canadian

6713
06:03:52,160 --> 06:03:55,040
symmetric cipher

6714
06:03:55,760 --> 06:03:56,878
okay

6715
06:03:56,878 --> 06:03:58,080
uh so let's talk about modes of

6716
06:03:58,080 --> 06:04:00,080
operation so you know you have a block

6717
06:04:00,080 --> 06:04:01,600
cipher use a mode of operation on it to

6718
06:04:01,600 --> 06:04:04,080
turn into a stream cipher uh so there's

6719
06:04:04,080 --> 06:04:05,280
like same modes operation you should use

6720
06:04:05,280 --> 06:04:07,040
gcm or counter or something that matches

6721
06:04:07,040 --> 06:04:09,040
your use case you can't use any of those

6722
06:04:09,040 --> 06:04:11,680
in pgp you can only use pgp's weird

6723
06:04:11,680 --> 06:04:13,840
custom cfp implementation

6724
06:04:13,840 --> 06:04:14,558
and

6725
06:04:14,558 --> 06:04:16,558
it's not authenticated default cfp isn't

6726
06:04:16,558 --> 06:04:19,120
either but this one isn't either uh

6727
06:04:19,120 --> 06:04:21,040
just read this implementation i mean the

6728
06:04:21,040 --> 06:04:22,878
iv is zero and then you add random

6729
06:04:22,878 --> 06:04:24,878
prefixes to the code to the to the

6730
06:04:24,878 --> 06:04:26,400
ciphertext instead that doesn't make any

6731
06:04:26,400 --> 06:04:28,480
[ __ ] sense nobody in their right mind

6732
06:04:28,480 --> 06:04:29,520
would design

6733
06:04:29,520 --> 06:04:31,200
a block cipher mode like that just

6734
06:04:31,200 --> 06:04:33,680
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense

6735
06:04:33,680 --> 06:04:35,760
uh so yeah let's go into the cybers

6736
06:04:35,760 --> 06:04:37,600
themselves uh just a quick throwback

6737
06:04:37,600 --> 06:04:42,079
[ __ ] rsa [ __ ] the conference rsa

6738
06:04:42,878 --> 06:04:44,638
[ __ ] the company rsa

6739
06:04:44,638 --> 06:04:45,760
and you know

6740
06:04:45,760 --> 06:04:47,600
[ __ ] those little token things

6741
06:04:47,600 --> 06:04:48,878
uh

6742
06:04:48,878 --> 06:04:50,958
back in 29 trailer bits scientifically

6743
06:04:50,958 --> 06:04:52,958
proved that rsa is satan's work and you

6744
06:04:52,958 --> 06:04:56,320
should not be using it in modern systems

6745
06:04:56,320 --> 06:04:58,878
uh fortunately for us guru pg defaults

6746
06:04:58,878 --> 06:05:00,558
to rsa because of course it's the only

6747
06:05:00,558 --> 06:05:02,240
sane choice in this insane ecosystem

6748
06:05:02,240 --> 06:05:04,160
which is really saying something

6749
06:05:04,160 --> 06:05:05,920
and of course their own docs hopefully

6750
06:05:05,920 --> 06:05:07,840
remind us that rsa 2048 is not

6751
06:05:07,840 --> 06:05:10,160
recommended after 2020 which of course

6752
06:05:10,160 --> 06:05:12,798
is the current year

6753
06:05:12,798 --> 06:05:14,958
okay so let's talk about another uh

6754
06:05:14,958 --> 06:05:18,160
crazy uh publicly cipher in gpg uh so

6755
06:05:18,160 --> 06:05:20,240
your only other real option is elgamal

6756
06:05:20,240 --> 06:05:21,600
and uh show of hands who in this

6757
06:05:21,600 --> 06:05:23,680
audience has used elgamal

6758
06:05:23,680 --> 06:05:25,760
one two three four five five people has

6759
06:05:25,760 --> 06:05:28,400
used alcohol uh the best thing i can say

6760
06:05:28,400 --> 06:05:30,400
about elgamal is that it's really really

6761
06:05:30,400 --> 06:05:31,920
weird

6762
06:05:31,920 --> 06:05:33,840
uh the original paper for alcohol which

6763
06:05:33,840 --> 06:05:35,760
is pretty much the only reference for

6764
06:05:35,760 --> 06:05:38,240
for the the crypto system is from 1985

6765
06:05:38,240 --> 06:05:40,558
which is like the pre-prehistory of

6766
06:05:40,558 --> 06:05:43,440
cryptography 1991 is pre-history 1985

6767
06:05:43,440 --> 06:05:45,120
it's basically the stone age

6768
06:05:45,120 --> 06:05:46,080
uh

6769
06:05:46,080 --> 06:05:47,760
the reason why pgp selected it for the

6770
06:05:47,760 --> 06:05:48,878
standard is because it has a minimal

6771
06:05:48,878 --> 06:05:50,638
legal incumbents and this is a recurring

6772
06:05:50,638 --> 06:05:52,320
theme in the pgp ecosystem they

6773
06:05:52,320 --> 06:05:53,440
basically don't pick anything because

6774
06:05:53,440 --> 06:05:55,040
it's good they pick it because they

6775
06:05:55,040 --> 06:05:56,958
think they can get away with in as many

6776
06:05:56,958 --> 06:05:58,958
places as possible instead of just you

6777
06:05:58,958 --> 06:06:00,000
know

6778
06:06:00,000 --> 06:06:01,280
doing the right thing and the thing is

6779
06:06:01,280 --> 06:06:02,558
even when they could get away with

6780
06:06:02,558 --> 06:06:03,680
things that aren't legally encumbered

6781
06:06:03,680 --> 06:06:05,280
which they could in 2007 aes was

6782
06:06:05,280 --> 06:06:08,000
standardized and they had ecc by 2007

6783
06:06:08,000 --> 06:06:09,280
they just simply chose not to

6784
06:06:09,280 --> 06:06:10,878
standardize those things

6785
06:06:10,878 --> 06:06:13,040
um and okama is is weird for a whole

6786
06:06:13,040 --> 06:06:14,080
bunch of reasons i'll get into but in

6787
06:06:14,080 --> 06:06:15,920
particular it's it's basically like rsa

6788
06:06:15,920 --> 06:06:17,360
but a little bit funky um you still have

6789
06:06:17,360 --> 06:06:18,480
the same malleability issues that you

6790
06:06:18,480 --> 06:06:20,160
have with rsa you have to understand

6791
06:06:20,160 --> 06:06:21,440
groups to achieve center security which

6792
06:06:21,440 --> 06:06:22,558
is terrible you shouldn't have to know

6793
06:06:22,558 --> 06:06:24,958
that to get cinematic security um the

6794
06:06:24,958 --> 06:06:26,878
keys are really huge like rsa for small

6795
06:06:26,878 --> 06:06:28,878
bit security so

6796
06:06:28,878 --> 06:06:31,200
uh 48-bit el gamaki corresponds to

6797
06:06:31,200 --> 06:06:34,400
roughly 140 bits in ecc world um and

6798
06:06:34,400 --> 06:06:35,680
it's essentially like rsa but with

6799
06:06:35,680 --> 06:06:37,200
discrete log as your hardness problem

6800
06:06:37,200 --> 06:06:39,440
instead of uh prime factorization

6801
06:06:39,440 --> 06:06:40,400
um

6802
06:06:40,400 --> 06:06:42,480
and and the problem with this is that uh

6803
06:06:42,480 --> 06:06:44,320
there's no actual standard for elgamal

6804
06:06:44,320 --> 06:06:48,400
so the pgprfc happily cites uh tahr's

6805
06:06:48,400 --> 06:06:50,798
original paper from 1985 which describes

6806
06:06:50,798 --> 06:06:53,280
basically oh pick two primes for your

6807
06:06:53,280 --> 06:06:55,360
for your cipher uh and the problem is

6808
06:06:55,360 --> 06:06:57,040
that depending on how you pick those two

6809
06:06:57,040 --> 06:06:58,080
primes

6810
06:06:58,080 --> 06:06:59,760
any other implementation that does prime

6811
06:06:59,760 --> 06:07:01,600
generation differently will be in will

6812
06:07:01,600 --> 06:07:03,200
be compatible with yours but will be

6813
06:07:03,200 --> 06:07:04,638
vulnerable to timing attacks based on

6814
06:07:04,638 --> 06:07:06,798
your prime generation and just a couple

6815
06:07:06,798 --> 06:07:08,878
months ago uh these guys surveyed eight

6816
06:07:08,878 --> 06:07:10,320
hundred thousand public

6817
06:07:10,320 --> 06:07:12,878
uh elgamal keys in the gpg ecosystem and

6818
06:07:12,878 --> 06:07:14,480
found the two thousand of them uh

6819
06:07:14,480 --> 06:07:16,558
respectable practical plaintext recovery

6820
06:07:16,558 --> 06:07:18,240
which is like insane because one why are

6821
06:07:18,240 --> 06:07:19,520
there eight hundred thousand keys for

6822
06:07:19,520 --> 06:07:22,080
elgamal and two like this this is a

6823
06:07:22,080 --> 06:07:23,520
problem that shouldn't exist in any

6824
06:07:23,520 --> 06:07:25,200
modern crypto system this is a problem

6825
06:07:25,200 --> 06:07:28,000
for like weird rsa in the 90s and yet in

6826
06:07:28,000 --> 06:07:29,280
2022

6827
06:07:29,280 --> 06:07:31,680
in pgp with elgamal you can just break

6828
06:07:31,680 --> 06:07:34,400
it like this completely nuts

6829
06:07:34,400 --> 06:07:35,760
um

6830
06:07:35,760 --> 06:07:37,040
going more into like the security

6831
06:07:37,040 --> 06:07:39,280
property side of things uh

6832
06:07:39,280 --> 06:07:41,920
users post heartbleed expect forward

6833
06:07:41,920 --> 06:07:43,520
secrecy in their protocols forward

6834
06:07:43,520 --> 06:07:45,360
secrecy is the property where

6835
06:07:45,360 --> 06:07:47,840
long-lived identity keys uh can be

6836
06:07:47,840 --> 06:07:49,440
compromised without compromising session

6837
06:07:49,440 --> 06:07:51,360
keys meaning that any traffic that goes

6838
06:07:51,360 --> 06:07:53,120
through your protocol uh that uses

6839
06:07:53,120 --> 06:07:55,360
encryption using session keys uh will

6840
06:07:55,360 --> 06:07:57,680
either self-heal or be uh encrypted and

6841
06:07:57,680 --> 06:07:59,680
not recoverable by the by the attacker

6842
06:07:59,680 --> 06:08:01,840
uh prior to the compromise uh this is a

6843
06:08:01,840 --> 06:08:03,680
really important property because in the

6844
06:08:03,680 --> 06:08:05,520
heart as hardly demonstrated if you leak

6845
06:08:05,520 --> 06:08:07,200
your long-lived identity key you can

6846
06:08:07,200 --> 06:08:08,558
decrypt any prior traffic that you

6847
06:08:08,558 --> 06:08:10,000
happen to capture as you know a

6848
06:08:10,000 --> 06:08:11,520
government agency or just someone

6849
06:08:11,520 --> 06:08:12,958
snooping on the wires

6850
06:08:12,958 --> 06:08:14,558
uh and like i said users expect this in

6851
06:08:14,558 --> 06:08:17,200
2022 it's a default part of signal to

6852
06:08:17,200 --> 06:08:19,520
default part of tls 1.3 it's part of ssh

6853
06:08:19,520 --> 06:08:21,600
which is not the most forward thinking

6854
06:08:21,600 --> 06:08:24,718
uh this is like basic basic stuff pgp

6855
06:08:24,718 --> 06:08:27,200
cannot provide forward secrecy and this

6856
06:08:27,200 --> 06:08:29,040
isn't itself a problem but pgp

6857
06:08:29,040 --> 06:08:31,280
encourages users to use it in ways that

6858
06:08:31,280 --> 06:08:33,120
would demand forward secrecy such as

6859
06:08:33,120 --> 06:08:35,120
email communication that's the problem

6860
06:08:35,120 --> 06:08:36,480
there are plenty of places where you

6861
06:08:36,480 --> 06:08:38,638
don't need forward secrecy but pgp wants

6862
06:08:38,638 --> 06:08:39,920
you to use it in places where you do

6863
06:08:39,920 --> 06:08:42,958
need it and that's you know [ __ ] nuts

6864
06:08:42,958 --> 06:08:44,798
um

6865
06:08:44,798 --> 06:08:46,320
yeah uh no

6866
06:08:46,320 --> 06:08:48,480
uh okay uh

6867
06:08:48,480 --> 06:08:50,400
let's talk about the web of trust

6868
06:08:50,400 --> 06:08:51,680
anybody else remember the web of trust

6869
06:08:51,680 --> 06:08:53,520
remember key signing parties

6870
06:08:53,520 --> 06:08:54,878
we used to get together at the super

6871
06:08:54,878 --> 06:08:57,360
spreader events and like walk around and

6872
06:08:57,360 --> 06:08:59,440
share each other's government ids and we

6873
06:08:59,440 --> 06:09:01,200
would like like hold the government id

6874
06:09:01,200 --> 06:09:03,040
up like this and you would like check to

6875
06:09:03,040 --> 06:09:04,240
make sure their name and their face

6876
06:09:04,240 --> 06:09:05,760
matched and you would write down their

6877
06:09:05,760 --> 06:09:08,240
key id on on a piece of [ __ ] paper

6878
06:09:08,240 --> 06:09:09,680
you would write down their key id like

6879
06:09:09,680 --> 06:09:10,798
that

6880
06:09:10,798 --> 06:09:12,958
and you would go home and like tape that

6881
06:09:12,958 --> 06:09:14,638
to your wall and check it against the

6882
06:09:14,638 --> 06:09:16,080
thing that's online

6883
06:09:16,080 --> 06:09:17,920
and then say oh yeah that's probably the

6884
06:09:17,920 --> 06:09:20,000
same person from here on forward no

6885
06:09:20,000 --> 06:09:21,440
matter what happens i'm going to trust

6886
06:09:21,440 --> 06:09:22,480
that key

6887
06:09:22,480 --> 06:09:24,160
does that sound sane to anybody in this

6888
06:09:24,160 --> 06:09:25,920
room that's like a terrible way to

6889
06:09:25,920 --> 06:09:28,000
design a system and yet that's how pgp

6890
06:09:28,000 --> 06:09:30,798
expected users to do this except of

6891
06:09:30,798 --> 06:09:33,520
course uh it [ __ ] died

6892
06:09:33,520 --> 06:09:35,120
uh it turns out that the sks network

6893
06:09:35,120 --> 06:09:37,280
which is the core part of the strong set

6894
06:09:37,280 --> 06:09:39,920
and the core part of the web of trust

6895
06:09:39,920 --> 06:09:42,000
was very easy to attack using pgp's

6896
06:09:42,000 --> 06:09:44,160
busted ass format

6897
06:09:44,160 --> 06:09:45,600
uh and basically someone just spammed it

6898
06:09:45,600 --> 06:09:47,280
with broken keys and they had to remove

6899
06:09:47,280 --> 06:09:48,718
it from gpg in

6900
06:09:48,718 --> 06:09:51,360
2.2 uh so the world just no longer

6901
06:09:51,360 --> 06:09:52,878
exists in the pg ecosystem so if you're

6902
06:09:52,878 --> 06:09:54,080
going to use that as a fallback for like

6903
06:09:54,080 --> 06:09:55,360
oh this is a really cool fundamental

6904
06:09:55,360 --> 06:09:57,280
property pgp does not provide that

6905
06:09:57,280 --> 06:09:58,558
anymore you cannot rely on that in a

6906
06:09:58,558 --> 06:10:00,558
modern implementation

6907
06:10:00,558 --> 06:10:01,360
um

6908
06:10:01,360 --> 06:10:02,878
but yeah and so you know

6909
06:10:02,878 --> 06:10:03,760
what i was talking about i sort of

6910
06:10:03,760 --> 06:10:05,200
glazed over this strong set thing and

6911
06:10:05,200 --> 06:10:06,400
the strong side is like a subset

6912
06:10:06,400 --> 06:10:08,400
property of of the of the way we trust

6913
06:10:08,400 --> 06:10:10,160
the ibn and strong said is like oh

6914
06:10:10,160 --> 06:10:11,920
eventually with enough interconnectivity

6915
06:10:11,920 --> 06:10:13,520
you can just arbitrarily trust any

6916
06:10:13,520 --> 06:10:15,120
identity because you know your friend

6917
06:10:15,120 --> 06:10:16,080
knows this friend knows this friend

6918
06:10:16,080 --> 06:10:17,360
knows his friend and like eventually you

6919
06:10:17,360 --> 06:10:19,200
get to whoever you're trying to encrypt

6920
06:10:19,200 --> 06:10:20,878
to uh but the problem with this is that

6921
06:10:20,878 --> 06:10:22,400
like we all in this room understand that

6922
06:10:22,400 --> 06:10:24,160
revocation is necessary like sometimes

6923
06:10:24,160 --> 06:10:25,840
you just lose a key or sometimes your

6924
06:10:25,840 --> 06:10:27,200
key was generated on like a bad piece of

6925
06:10:27,200 --> 06:10:28,558
hardware and you just need to get rid of

6926
06:10:28,558 --> 06:10:30,240
that key but the problem the strong says

6927
06:10:30,240 --> 06:10:32,000
there's no formal revocation system you

6928
06:10:32,000 --> 06:10:33,440
can just sort of like

6929
06:10:33,440 --> 06:10:35,440
hold on to that key forever

6930
06:10:35,440 --> 06:10:37,120
uh which is again just

6931
06:10:37,120 --> 06:10:38,798
no sane ecosystem would be designed this

6932
06:10:38,798 --> 06:10:40,558
way but because pgp is from the stone

6933
06:10:40,558 --> 06:10:42,400
age cryptography nobody really thought

6934
06:10:42,400 --> 06:10:44,400
these things through

6935
06:10:44,400 --> 06:10:46,160
um yeah so let's talk about like the

6936
06:10:46,160 --> 06:10:48,080
killer app for for pgp which is

6937
06:10:48,080 --> 06:10:49,680
supposedly email

6938
06:10:49,680 --> 06:10:50,878
um

6939
06:10:50,878 --> 06:10:52,638
so i just wanted to read this out uh

6940
06:10:52,638 --> 06:10:54,000
this is how on the left hand side this

6941
06:10:54,000 --> 06:10:57,200
is how pgp pgp's enablers describe

6942
06:10:57,200 --> 06:10:59,440
uh pgp's use they say over the last

6943
06:10:59,440 --> 06:11:02,160
decade pgp and later open pgp has become

6944
06:11:02,160 --> 06:11:03,440
the standard for nearly all the world

6945
06:11:03,440 --> 06:11:05,120
signed or encrypted email and then on

6946
06:11:05,120 --> 06:11:06,558
the right-hand side here we see

6947
06:11:06,558 --> 06:11:08,878
decade-old e-file flaws can leak plain

6948
06:11:08,878 --> 06:11:11,600
text of pgp and s my encrypted emails so

6949
06:11:11,600 --> 06:11:13,360
you know reconcile these two in your

6950
06:11:13,360 --> 06:11:14,480
head please

6951
06:11:14,480 --> 06:11:15,520
uh

6952
06:11:15,520 --> 06:11:17,360
and then you know these these these

6953
06:11:17,360 --> 06:11:19,280
companies that sell pgp as a product and

6954
06:11:19,280 --> 06:11:20,480
these these standards bodies that try to

6955
06:11:20,480 --> 06:11:22,400
promote pgp will tell you that oh you

6956
06:11:22,400 --> 06:11:23,920
can just easily enable in your email

6957
06:11:23,920 --> 06:11:25,280
client and your email client will

6958
06:11:25,280 --> 06:11:27,840
provide a secure interface for pgp

6959
06:11:27,840 --> 06:11:29,360
between you and your and your email

6960
06:11:29,360 --> 06:11:31,200
client but but the reality is that none

6961
06:11:31,200 --> 06:11:32,798
of these probably none of these clients

6962
06:11:32,798 --> 06:11:34,240
will guarantee the security of their

6963
06:11:34,240 --> 06:11:35,680
plugins they are so terrified that there

6964
06:11:35,680 --> 06:11:37,280
are fundamental breaks in their plug-ins

6965
06:11:37,280 --> 06:11:39,200
they will all say we cannot provide any

6966
06:11:39,200 --> 06:11:40,958
security guarantees

6967
06:11:40,958 --> 06:11:42,558
you know and obviously you know this is

6968
06:11:42,558 --> 06:11:44,480
all open source you you you know you got

6969
06:11:44,480 --> 06:11:46,000
to balance these things anyways but like

6970
06:11:46,000 --> 06:11:47,440
the people who are writing this code

6971
06:11:47,440 --> 06:11:49,360
know that it's bad and they will not

6972
06:11:49,360 --> 06:11:51,520
provide any guarantees for it

6973
06:11:51,520 --> 06:11:53,040
um and of course you know the real heads

6974
06:11:53,040 --> 06:11:54,718
know this you know if you really want to

6975
06:11:54,718 --> 06:11:56,000
encrypt something like pgp you got to

6976
06:11:56,000 --> 06:11:57,600
get your private key you got to get your

6977
06:11:57,600 --> 06:11:59,360
your recipient's public key and you just

6978
06:11:59,360 --> 06:12:00,878
have to not care if you accidentally

6979
06:12:00,878 --> 06:12:02,160
send it encrypted because these clients

6980
06:12:02,160 --> 06:12:04,160
are [ __ ] terrible they're really

6981
06:12:04,160 --> 06:12:06,400
really hard to use correctly

6982
06:12:06,400 --> 06:12:07,760
um

6983
06:12:07,760 --> 06:12:08,878
i just wanted to throw this one in

6984
06:12:08,878 --> 06:12:10,160
because this one is a nice mixture of

6985
06:12:10,160 --> 06:12:12,798
email and pgp so if you'll notice this

6986
06:12:12,798 --> 06:12:14,558
is the fourth of july

6987
06:12:14,558 --> 06:12:17,120
2022. this was this was

6988
06:12:17,120 --> 06:12:18,638
four days ago

6989
06:12:18,638 --> 06:12:21,840
uh somebody sent a pgp encrypted email

6990
06:12:21,840 --> 06:12:23,920
to the oss security mailing list that

6991
06:12:23,920 --> 06:12:26,160
contains a weaponized exploit denial of

6992
06:12:26,160 --> 06:12:27,760
service for pgp

6993
06:12:27,760 --> 06:12:31,280
and i quote this is insane you can send

6994
06:12:31,280 --> 06:12:32,878
weaponized exploits to crash email

6995
06:12:32,878 --> 06:12:35,040
clients to public mindless please do not

6996
06:12:35,040 --> 06:12:37,280
do this again the thing is there's no

6997
06:12:37,280 --> 06:12:38,878
way to guarantee this pgp's message

6998
06:12:38,878 --> 06:12:41,040
format is completely [ __ ]

6999
06:12:41,040 --> 06:12:43,760
uh it's very very easy to do like zip

7000
06:12:43,760 --> 06:12:44,958
bombs in it compare any kind of

7001
06:12:44,958 --> 06:12:46,718
compression bomb any kind of recursive

7002
06:12:46,718 --> 06:12:47,680
structure

7003
06:12:47,680 --> 06:12:49,520
there is no formal way for them to fix

7004
06:12:49,520 --> 06:12:50,718
this without fundamentally breaking the

7005
06:12:50,718 --> 06:12:51,760
protocol

7006
06:12:51,760 --> 06:12:52,718
and of course you get all the classic

7007
06:12:52,718 --> 06:12:55,760
responses like oh not a bug sorry

7008
06:12:55,760 --> 06:12:57,440
uh why was this even a good idea in the

7009
06:12:57,440 --> 06:12:59,440
first place and the justification being

7010
06:12:59,440 --> 06:13:01,600
in the mid 90s which spoiler it's not

7011
06:13:01,600 --> 06:13:04,400
the mid 90s anymore

7012
06:13:04,400 --> 06:13:06,638
um yeah so so the big picture here is

7013
06:13:06,638 --> 06:13:08,400
that pgp lures you into this like false

7014
06:13:08,400 --> 06:13:10,080
sense of security so

7015
06:13:10,080 --> 06:13:11,520
let's say that like you do everything

7016
06:13:11,520 --> 06:13:14,000
right let's say that you have a large

7017
06:13:14,000 --> 06:13:16,400
bit rsa key you're using like a

7018
06:13:16,400 --> 06:13:18,080
non-standard symmetric cipher so let's

7019
06:13:18,080 --> 06:13:19,280
say you're using

7020
06:13:19,280 --> 06:13:21,040
aes which is optional let's say that

7021
06:13:21,040 --> 06:13:23,360
you're using a reasonable hass function

7022
06:13:23,360 --> 06:13:25,680
even if you do all these things email is

7023
06:13:25,680 --> 06:13:27,440
fundamentally not secure for encrypted

7024
06:13:27,440 --> 06:13:29,040
channels uh you are still sending

7025
06:13:29,040 --> 06:13:30,638
unencrypted metadata including your

7026
06:13:30,638 --> 06:13:31,760
recipients and your subject line you

7027
06:13:31,760 --> 06:13:32,638
know i don't know about you but my

7028
06:13:32,638 --> 06:13:34,240
subject line is usually pretty sensitive

7029
06:13:34,240 --> 06:13:35,600
uh encrypting that is probably a good

7030
06:13:35,600 --> 06:13:37,280
idea but you just can't do that in email

7031
06:13:37,280 --> 06:13:39,440
without additional mechanisms

7032
06:13:39,440 --> 06:13:40,638
um

7033
06:13:40,638 --> 06:13:41,920
again probably everybody in this room

7034
06:13:41,920 --> 06:13:43,840
who's used pgp in an actual context on

7035
06:13:43,840 --> 06:13:45,440
email you've probably sent something to

7036
06:13:45,440 --> 06:13:46,558
someone encrypted and they just reply to

7037
06:13:46,558 --> 06:13:48,160
you in clear text with your message in

7038
06:13:48,160 --> 06:13:49,360
the response

7039
06:13:49,360 --> 06:13:51,680
like what did you just accomplish

7040
06:13:51,680 --> 06:13:54,080
all they did was just reply to you

7041
06:13:54,080 --> 06:13:55,200
um

7042
06:13:55,200 --> 06:13:56,160
and then finally there's like these

7043
06:13:56,160 --> 06:13:57,840
subtle things like non-repudiation where

7044
06:13:57,840 --> 06:13:58,798
like

7045
06:13:58,798 --> 06:14:00,160
there's all kinds of emails that i send

7046
06:14:00,160 --> 06:14:01,680
where like i don't necessarily want

7047
06:14:01,680 --> 06:14:02,958
there to be a global identity that

7048
06:14:02,958 --> 06:14:04,320
proves that i permanently sent this

7049
06:14:04,320 --> 06:14:06,480
email for all time like at somewhere in

7050
06:14:06,480 --> 06:14:07,600
the user i might be able to say like oh

7051
06:14:07,600 --> 06:14:09,440
i genuinely forgot that i sent that or

7052
06:14:09,440 --> 06:14:11,120
that wasn't me i got hacked even if i'd

7053
06:14:11,120 --> 06:14:12,718
even if i didn't in fact send it but

7054
06:14:12,718 --> 06:14:14,160
like that's kind of a property that

7055
06:14:14,160 --> 06:14:16,240
users expect in modern protocols but pgp

7056
06:14:16,240 --> 06:14:18,400
fundamentally cannot give you this um

7057
06:14:18,400 --> 06:14:19,840
and this this quote below is from from

7058
06:14:19,840 --> 06:14:21,040
laticor's blog and it's a really

7059
06:14:21,040 --> 06:14:22,400
fantastic article there's a link at the

7060
06:14:22,400 --> 06:14:23,600
end of the

7061
06:14:23,600 --> 06:14:24,958
talk

7062
06:14:24,958 --> 06:14:27,440
um so finally uh the i can fix him

7063
06:14:27,440 --> 06:14:29,280
segment of the talk

7064
06:14:29,280 --> 06:14:32,160
uh no you [ __ ] can't uh you have two

7065
06:14:32,160 --> 06:14:34,080
options exactly two options in the pgp

7066
06:14:34,080 --> 06:14:35,360
ecosystem

7067
06:14:35,360 --> 06:14:37,120
you can either accept and generate all

7068
06:14:37,120 --> 06:14:39,840
the crap that the rfc requires you to

7069
06:14:39,840 --> 06:14:41,280
or you can do your own thing and use

7070
06:14:41,280 --> 06:14:43,200
non-standard ciphers and here's the

7071
06:14:43,200 --> 06:14:45,200
thing if you do the latter which is the

7072
06:14:45,200 --> 06:14:47,760
the right thing to do you are in effect

7073
06:14:47,760 --> 06:14:49,840
in a canoe pg monoculture you are just

7074
06:14:49,840 --> 06:14:51,440
using the gnu pg implementation and

7075
06:14:51,440 --> 06:14:52,798
anybody who receives your stuff also has

7076
06:14:52,798 --> 06:14:54,558
to use that implementation now don't

7077
06:14:54,558 --> 06:14:56,000
even get me [ __ ] started on sequoia

7078
06:14:56,000 --> 06:14:58,160
but essentially it's that

7079
06:14:58,160 --> 06:14:59,680
uh

7080
06:14:59,680 --> 06:15:01,600
you have two options that's it do not

7081
06:15:01,600 --> 06:15:03,840
try to do better you cannot uh and we've

7082
06:15:03,840 --> 06:15:04,798
only scratched the surface here i've

7083
06:15:04,798 --> 06:15:05,920
only talked about like the cryptography

7084
06:15:05,920 --> 06:15:07,280
and the message format we haven't talked

7085
06:15:07,280 --> 06:15:09,600
about the hell that is the gpg cli i

7086
06:15:09,600 --> 06:15:10,638
don't know about you but every time i

7087
06:15:10,638 --> 06:15:13,200
use the gbcli i break my my teletype

7088
06:15:13,200 --> 06:15:15,440
because i end up posting binary to my

7089
06:15:15,440 --> 06:15:17,760
terminal and and i have to reset it so

7090
06:15:17,760 --> 06:15:20,080
please just for the love of god just use

7091
06:15:20,080 --> 06:15:22,718
something else

7092
06:15:22,958 --> 06:15:25,120
uh so with that in mind uh what should

7093
06:15:25,120 --> 06:15:26,878
you use

7094
06:15:26,878 --> 06:15:30,320
yeah really uh so let's say let's say

7095
06:15:30,320 --> 06:15:31,280
you want to text your friends or buy

7096
06:15:31,280 --> 06:15:33,360
some drugs just use signal everybody in

7097
06:15:33,360 --> 06:15:34,558
this room is technical you can figure

7098
06:15:34,558 --> 06:15:36,000
out signal you can even figure out the

7099
06:15:36,000 --> 06:15:37,280
little safety message thing it's not

7100
06:15:37,280 --> 06:15:38,400
that hard

7101
06:15:38,400 --> 06:15:40,160
uh if you're emailing anyone stop

7102
06:15:40,160 --> 06:15:42,320
larping i know you're not using it for

7103
06:15:42,320 --> 06:15:44,320
real security you're using it because it

7104
06:15:44,320 --> 06:15:47,200
looks cool i know that i know that you

7105
06:15:47,200 --> 06:15:50,000
know that stop doing it

7106
06:15:50,000 --> 06:15:52,320
emailing fi uh encrypting files usage

7107
06:15:52,320 --> 06:15:54,798
again is really good uh the public

7108
06:15:54,798 --> 06:15:58,080
standard it has a bnf st uh formalized

7109
06:15:58,080 --> 06:15:59,600
uh format which means you can actually

7110
06:15:59,600 --> 06:16:01,280
parse it in the same way

7111
06:16:01,280 --> 06:16:02,240
uh and then you know if you have to

7112
06:16:02,240 --> 06:16:03,600
store things online tar snap is a really

7113
06:16:03,600 --> 06:16:05,920
good service it's run by one guy uh he's

7114
06:16:05,920 --> 06:16:08,000
like a progenitor of a lot of important

7115
06:16:08,000 --> 06:16:09,920
crypto stuff colin and just highly

7116
06:16:09,920 --> 06:16:12,480
recommend it um and then also

7117
06:16:12,480 --> 06:16:13,680
i know some of you are still signing

7118
06:16:13,680 --> 06:16:14,638
commits

7119
06:16:14,638 --> 06:16:15,360
even though it doesn't really do

7120
06:16:15,360 --> 06:16:17,680
anything okay that's fine whatever uh

7121
06:16:17,680 --> 06:16:19,440
you can use ssh forget now for signing

7122
06:16:19,440 --> 06:16:21,680
comments uh github needs to add support

7123
06:16:21,680 --> 06:16:23,360
but you if you if everybody in this

7124
06:16:23,360 --> 06:16:25,600
audience agitates github to do so i bet

7125
06:16:25,600 --> 06:16:26,718
they'll get it done just a little bit

7126
06:16:26,718 --> 06:16:28,798
faster and we should really all be using

7127
06:16:28,798 --> 06:16:31,760
ssh for signing anyways

7128
06:16:31,760 --> 06:16:34,400
um yeah and then uh just to wrap things

7129
06:16:34,400 --> 06:16:35,440
up a little bit i wanted to show a

7130
06:16:35,440 --> 06:16:36,558
little bit of some some work that i'm

7131
06:16:36,558 --> 06:16:38,480
doing uh so

7132
06:16:38,480 --> 06:16:39,920
just just to remind you like you know

7133
06:16:39,920 --> 06:16:41,280
when's the last time any of you actually

7134
06:16:41,280 --> 06:16:42,878
verified a python package's pgp

7135
06:16:42,878 --> 06:16:44,480
signature did you even know that pip

7136
06:16:44,480 --> 06:16:46,240
contains the abilities to verify pgp

7137
06:16:46,240 --> 06:16:48,400
signatures like probably not i don't i

7138
06:16:48,400 --> 06:16:50,718
don't ever use that and i work on it

7139
06:16:50,718 --> 06:16:52,558
uh when was the last time you published

7140
06:16:52,558 --> 06:16:54,400
a pgp signature for your code and debian

7141
06:16:54,400 --> 06:16:55,440
maintainers you don't count because

7142
06:16:55,440 --> 06:16:56,718
nobody actually cares that your

7143
06:16:56,718 --> 06:16:58,000
signatures are there

7144
06:16:58,000 --> 06:16:58,798
uh

7145
06:16:58,798 --> 06:17:01,040
you know it doesn't count

7146
06:17:01,040 --> 06:17:02,958
uh i i personally believe the future

7147
06:17:02,958 --> 06:17:04,638
here is something like sync store and

7148
06:17:04,638 --> 06:17:05,760
the core idea behind something like six

7149
06:17:05,760 --> 06:17:07,440
store is rather than maintaining a

7150
06:17:07,440 --> 06:17:09,280
long-lived key that you have to

7151
06:17:09,280 --> 06:17:10,798
basically preserve and update

7152
06:17:10,798 --> 06:17:13,040
periodically and do do revocations for

7153
06:17:13,040 --> 06:17:14,558
you have a long-term identity which can

7154
06:17:14,558 --> 06:17:16,160
be an email account or some other

7155
06:17:16,160 --> 06:17:18,000
account on some service and you provide

7156
06:17:18,000 --> 06:17:19,760
an attestation for owning that identity

7157
06:17:19,760 --> 06:17:20,958
which then comes with a claim set that

7158
06:17:20,958 --> 06:17:22,718
you use to generate a certificate and

7159
06:17:22,718 --> 06:17:23,920
that's a little bit more complicated

7160
06:17:23,920 --> 06:17:25,200
there's a little bit more moving parts

7161
06:17:25,200 --> 06:17:27,280
there but the advantage is that you can

7162
06:17:27,280 --> 06:17:28,878
do something like that with the ct log

7163
06:17:28,878 --> 06:17:31,120
and the cctv log provides critically

7164
06:17:31,120 --> 06:17:32,718
audibility and transparency for all your

7165
06:17:32,718 --> 06:17:34,080
signing actions and that's that's going

7166
06:17:34,080 --> 06:17:36,080
to be really important going forwards

7167
06:17:36,080 --> 06:17:36,958
especially as people are you know

7168
06:17:36,958 --> 06:17:38,558
talking more about the supply chain um

7169
06:17:38,558 --> 06:17:40,160
and yeah we're working on that so you

7170
06:17:40,160 --> 06:17:41,520
know talk to me about it if you want to

7171
06:17:41,520 --> 06:17:43,120
afterwards

7172
06:17:43,120 --> 06:17:46,160
um so yeah uh in conclusion uh pgp

7173
06:17:46,160 --> 06:17:48,080
delinda asked there is no good reason to

7174
06:17:48,080 --> 06:17:51,040
be using pgp in 2022 you need to stop

7175
06:17:51,040 --> 06:17:52,878
okay convince your bosses to stop

7176
06:17:52,878 --> 06:17:54,558
convince everybody around you to stop

7177
06:17:54,558 --> 06:17:58,610
there is simply no good reason thank you

7178
06:17:58,610 --> 06:18:03,840
[Applause]

7179
06:18:03,840 --> 06:18:06,718
i will not be taken

7180
06:18:06,718 --> 06:18:10,680
i will not be taking questions

7181
06:18:17,360 --> 06:18:20,400
that was great thank you

7182
06:18:22,558 --> 06:18:25,040
um it's it i just want to say it's not

7183
06:18:25,040 --> 06:18:27,840
the my little ponies fan club it's

7184
06:18:27,840 --> 06:18:30,638
called the ponies committee and we are

7185
06:18:30,638 --> 06:18:32,558
responsible for an important hacking

7186
06:18:32,558 --> 06:18:35,600
award all right so that's first off

7187
06:18:35,600 --> 06:18:37,520
uh second uh that i was thinking about

7188
06:18:37,520 --> 06:18:38,958
this while back there like a lot of the

7189
06:18:38,958 --> 06:18:40,958
problems that pgp was designed to solve

7190
06:18:40,958 --> 06:18:42,638
for were like

7191
06:18:42,638 --> 06:18:45,680
intrinsic to being you know born in a

7192
06:18:45,680 --> 06:18:48,878
time when you had to carry all your bits

7193
06:18:48,878 --> 06:18:52,638
on little pieces of plastic that rotated

7194
06:18:52,638 --> 06:18:54,478
in a thing that you could like you know

7195
06:18:54,478 --> 06:18:56,080
put into the computer

7196
06:18:56,080 --> 06:18:58,320
and if you dropped those bits hard

7197
06:18:58,320 --> 06:19:01,040
enough you could lose all of your bits

7198
06:19:01,040 --> 06:19:03,440
so it was yeah like the

7199
06:19:03,440 --> 06:19:05,600
the problems were solved poorly

7200
06:19:05,600 --> 06:19:08,160
but there was a constraint that you know

7201
06:19:08,160 --> 06:19:10,160
we don't have anymore and we look back

7202
06:19:10,160 --> 06:19:12,240
on it and we forget how constrained we

7203
06:19:12,240 --> 06:19:13,840
were anyway

7204
06:19:13,840 --> 06:19:15,440
um

7205
06:19:15,440 --> 06:19:18,718
our next presentation

7206
06:19:18,718 --> 06:19:20,878
is

7207
06:19:20,878 --> 06:19:22,320
oh there he is i was wondering when you

7208
06:19:22,320 --> 06:19:25,360
were going to show up dan um

7209
06:19:25,360 --> 06:19:27,360
we are a little ahead of schedule but

7210
06:19:27,360 --> 06:19:28,478
i'd like to get him out here because i

7211
06:19:28,478 --> 06:19:30,240
know that he can he could he can take

7212
06:19:30,240 --> 06:19:33,760
the the the the he can use the time

7213
06:19:33,760 --> 06:19:34,558
uh

7214
06:19:34,558 --> 06:19:38,240
dan is a stalwart of of summercon

7215
06:19:38,240 --> 06:19:39,680
presentations

7216
06:19:39,680 --> 06:19:41,120
and um

7217
06:19:41,120 --> 06:19:43,440
is going to give

7218
06:19:43,440 --> 06:19:45,600
another trail of bits style

7219
06:19:45,600 --> 06:19:48,320
controversial

7220
06:19:48,320 --> 06:19:49,840
discussion

7221
06:19:49,840 --> 06:19:51,760
may make may make a bunch of people

7222
06:19:51,760 --> 06:19:53,280
angry yeah

7223
06:19:53,280 --> 06:19:56,320
what the blockchain got right everybody

7224
06:19:56,320 --> 06:19:59,920
warm welcome for dan guido

7225
06:20:01,680 --> 06:20:04,160
one of these will work sure all right

7226
06:20:04,160 --> 06:20:06,680
i'll figure it out

7227
06:20:06,680 --> 06:20:09,779
[Music]

7228
06:20:15,840 --> 06:20:16,798
okay

7229
06:20:16,798 --> 06:20:19,200
hi oh yeah you can make it slightly

7230
06:20:19,200 --> 06:20:20,840
higher

7231
06:20:20,840 --> 06:20:24,400
thanks hey there we go

7232
06:20:24,400 --> 06:20:27,520
all right let me get uh

7233
06:20:33,680 --> 06:20:34,840
where's

7234
06:20:34,840 --> 06:20:36,478
the

7235
06:20:36,478 --> 06:20:39,478
desktop

7236
06:21:08,240 --> 06:21:11,400
thank you

7237
06:21:18,958 --> 06:21:23,160
give me one second i gotta get a beer

7238
06:21:40,878 --> 06:21:45,558
that's right we got help this this year

7239
06:21:46,320 --> 06:21:48,320
okay

7240
06:21:48,320 --> 06:21:50,638
so hello everybody i'm dan guido the ceo

7241
06:21:50,638 --> 06:21:52,478
of trailer bits and this is probably my

7242
06:21:52,478 --> 06:21:53,600
third or fourth time speaking at

7243
06:21:53,600 --> 06:21:54,878
summercon

7244
06:21:54,878 --> 06:21:57,280
uh i wanted to give a talk i ruined the

7245
06:21:57,280 --> 06:21:59,120
agenda this time i'm giving a talk about

7246
06:21:59,120 --> 06:22:00,718
blockchain and i'm giving a talk about

7247
06:22:00,718 --> 06:22:02,878
this because i want to tell you why a

7248
06:22:02,878 --> 06:22:05,600
bunch of nft mouth breathers somehow

7249
06:22:05,600 --> 06:22:07,520
invented a more secure platform to write

7250
06:22:07,520 --> 06:22:09,440
software than you use

7251
06:22:09,440 --> 06:22:10,878
uh so

7252
06:22:10,878 --> 06:22:12,320
if you're still doing it feel free to

7253
06:22:12,320 --> 06:22:15,840
drink to the word blockchain

7254
06:22:16,878 --> 06:22:20,478
my uh my beer is on the way

7255
06:22:20,958 --> 06:22:23,280
okay so let's just start with ethereum

7256
06:22:23,280 --> 06:22:27,000
we'll pick on them first

7257
06:22:28,160 --> 06:22:30,958
thank you all right backup

7258
06:22:30,958 --> 06:22:32,310
thank you

7259
06:22:32,310 --> 06:22:34,160
[Laughter]

7260
06:22:34,160 --> 06:22:36,400
uh so ethereum gives you the ability to

7261
06:22:36,400 --> 06:22:37,760
write smart contracts which are these

7262
06:22:37,760 --> 06:22:39,760
little autonomous finance bots that

7263
06:22:39,760 --> 06:22:41,600
receive a transaction and they modify

7264
06:22:41,600 --> 06:22:43,440
global state that's like the basis of it

7265
06:22:43,440 --> 06:22:44,638
right

7266
06:22:44,638 --> 06:22:46,240
and blockchain kind of has a little bit

7267
06:22:46,240 --> 06:22:49,040
of a reputation uh it's you know these

7268
06:22:49,040 --> 06:22:50,958
tiny programs that evolve in consensus

7269
06:22:50,958 --> 06:22:52,400
you can do tokens you can do credit

7270
06:22:52,400 --> 06:22:54,240
default swaps you can integrate them in

7271
06:22:54,240 --> 06:22:55,360
browsers

7272
06:22:55,360 --> 06:22:56,718
but they're built in the shittiest

7273
06:22:56,718 --> 06:22:58,878
version of javascript you could invent

7274
06:22:58,878 --> 06:23:01,040
and the community itself is not so into

7275
06:23:01,040 --> 06:23:03,040
security so this is a real screenshot

7276
06:23:03,040 --> 06:23:04,478
from a project

7277
06:23:04,478 --> 06:23:06,160
that i was paying attention to a couple

7278
06:23:06,160 --> 06:23:08,240
years back where they just launched and

7279
06:23:08,240 --> 06:23:09,840
they said they had a little trello card

7280
06:23:09,840 --> 06:23:11,520
for oh we should get a security audit

7281
06:23:11,520 --> 06:23:13,440
but as you can read they kind of just

7282
06:23:13,440 --> 06:23:14,878
forgot and they didn't think that was a

7283
06:23:14,878 --> 06:23:16,160
big deal

7284
06:23:16,160 --> 06:23:18,000
so most of the time when they get hacked

7285
06:23:18,000 --> 06:23:19,680
they lose a crap ton of other people's

7286
06:23:19,680 --> 06:23:21,120
money

7287
06:23:21,120 --> 06:23:23,520
um the language itself is profiled in a

7288
06:23:23,520 --> 06:23:25,120
really good talk by a guy from trailer

7289
06:23:25,120 --> 06:23:27,520
bits evan satanic called the anatomy of

7290
06:23:27,520 --> 06:23:29,120
an unsafe programming language i highly

7291
06:23:29,120 --> 06:23:32,000
recommend you check it out

7292
06:23:32,240 --> 06:23:34,478
oh and just to keep it fresh just like

7293
06:23:34,478 --> 06:23:36,558
will did this is a bug report from two

7294
06:23:36,558 --> 06:23:38,878
days ago where the compiler introduced a

7295
06:23:38,878 --> 06:23:40,638
codegen bug that eliminates a bunch of

7296
06:23:40,638 --> 06:23:43,920
safety checks probably by accident so

7297
06:23:43,920 --> 06:23:46,160
just to like really drive the point home

7298
06:23:46,160 --> 06:23:47,920
here we're not dealing with the best

7299
06:23:47,920 --> 06:23:48,958
tools when you're trying to make

7300
06:23:48,958 --> 06:23:51,280
software

7301
06:23:51,280 --> 06:23:54,160
uh so again it's it's this like shared

7302
06:23:54,160 --> 06:23:56,240
global computer so there's people on one

7303
06:23:56,240 --> 06:23:58,400
end and you can send inputs to contracts

7304
06:23:58,400 --> 06:24:00,638
the finance bots that can manipulate

7305
06:24:00,638 --> 06:24:02,638
global state which are like balances

7306
06:24:02,638 --> 06:24:04,558
let's say and in this whole system you

7307
06:24:04,558 --> 06:24:06,638
can see every transaction that happens

7308
06:24:06,638 --> 06:24:08,638
and you can send input to any contract

7309
06:24:08,638 --> 06:24:10,400
or any account so everything is kind of

7310
06:24:10,400 --> 06:24:12,878
fair game

7311
06:24:13,040 --> 06:24:14,718
and the way you program these finance

7312
06:24:14,718 --> 06:24:16,320
bots is with this language called

7313
06:24:16,320 --> 06:24:17,840
solidity

7314
06:24:17,840 --> 06:24:19,760
it's targeted at javascript so that you

7315
06:24:19,760 --> 06:24:22,400
can get like node and web developers

7316
06:24:22,400 --> 06:24:23,760
and it's only a few years old versus

7317
06:24:23,760 --> 06:24:25,840
languages like c plus plus that might be

7318
06:24:25,840 --> 06:24:27,600
40 years old and have all these bunch of

7319
06:24:27,600 --> 06:24:28,798
problems

7320
06:24:28,798 --> 06:24:29,920
so

7321
06:24:29,920 --> 06:24:31,120
you would think that they took this

7322
06:24:31,120 --> 06:24:32,558
opportunity to fix a bunch of those

7323
06:24:32,558 --> 06:24:34,958
issues but no they changed the order of

7324
06:24:34,958 --> 06:24:38,160
operations uh like for one thing and

7325
06:24:38,160 --> 06:24:39,840
they didn't really design the language

7326
06:24:39,840 --> 06:24:41,680
they're kind of just evolving it as time

7327
06:24:41,680 --> 06:24:43,760
goes on as you could see by that bug

7328
06:24:43,760 --> 06:24:46,000
report from a slide back

7329
06:24:46,000 --> 06:24:48,320
so like ah it can't be that bad right

7330
06:24:48,320 --> 06:24:49,840
like it's just javascript and millions

7331
06:24:49,840 --> 06:24:51,760
of people write javascript every day

7332
06:24:51,760 --> 06:24:53,600
but completely unlike every single

7333
06:24:53,600 --> 06:24:55,200
language that was invented in the last

7334
06:24:55,200 --> 06:24:56,400
10 years

7335
06:24:56,400 --> 06:24:58,558
uh you've got like exploitable knowledge

7336
06:24:58,558 --> 06:25:01,280
references uh you've got and that

7337
06:25:01,280 --> 06:25:02,638
exploitable knowledge reference is

7338
06:25:02,638 --> 06:25:03,600
actually like

7339
06:25:03,600 --> 06:25:05,920
impressive that they managed to do that

7340
06:25:05,920 --> 06:25:08,478
because the zero page is where you store

7341
06:25:08,478 --> 06:25:10,478
the account owner for a given smart

7342
06:25:10,478 --> 06:25:12,080
contract so if you can exploit an older

7343
06:25:12,080 --> 06:25:13,440
reference you can put yourself as the

7344
06:25:13,440 --> 06:25:15,520
owner and steal all the money right just

7345
06:25:15,520 --> 06:25:18,878
like totally bonkers [ __ ]

7346
06:25:21,680 --> 06:25:23,280
but in reality

7347
06:25:23,280 --> 06:25:24,638
i can tell you from working on this at

7348
06:25:24,638 --> 06:25:26,558
trailer bits that

7349
06:25:26,558 --> 06:25:28,558
we have people come in the door with

7350
06:25:28,558 --> 06:25:30,638
high coverage symbolic execution

7351
06:25:30,638 --> 06:25:32,718
security tests we have people come in

7352
06:25:32,718 --> 06:25:34,958
the door with verified code in a way

7353
06:25:34,958 --> 06:25:38,160
unlike every other industry we work in

7354
06:25:38,160 --> 06:25:39,840
it is way ahead of the industry when it

7355
06:25:39,840 --> 06:25:41,760
comes to software testing

7356
06:25:41,760 --> 06:25:43,920
everybody runs baseline static analysis

7357
06:25:43,920 --> 06:25:45,520
and they have far better adoption of

7358
06:25:45,520 --> 06:25:47,280
things like property testing

7359
06:25:47,280 --> 06:25:48,958
so this is almost where we want the

7360
06:25:48,958 --> 06:25:50,478
industry to be

7361
06:25:50,478 --> 06:25:52,798
so how did these weird nft [ __ ]

7362
06:25:52,798 --> 06:25:54,080
figure this out

7363
06:25:54,080 --> 06:25:56,000
and we haven't

7364
06:25:56,000 --> 06:25:57,680
because they really they like pulled one

7365
06:25:57,680 --> 06:26:00,240
over on us

7366
06:26:00,240 --> 06:26:01,760
so here i want to digress for a second

7367
06:26:01,760 --> 06:26:03,440
there's an old joke about a dairy farmer

7368
06:26:03,440 --> 06:26:04,400
that's trying to keep up with an

7369
06:26:04,400 --> 06:26:06,400
aggregate conglomerate down the road

7370
06:26:06,400 --> 06:26:08,400
he asks a physicist for help

7371
06:26:08,400 --> 06:26:09,840
and he comes back a week later and the

7372
06:26:09,840 --> 06:26:12,638
physicist says he has a solution but it

7373
06:26:12,638 --> 06:26:16,638
only works on spherical cows in a vacuum

7374
06:26:16,638 --> 06:26:18,958
and that's how reading papers from

7375
06:26:18,958 --> 06:26:21,280
academia feels most the time it only

7376
06:26:21,280 --> 06:26:23,360
works on spherical cows in a vacuum but

7377
06:26:23,360 --> 06:26:26,080
luckily ethereum and blockchain software

7378
06:26:26,080 --> 06:26:30,000
only supports spherical cows

7379
06:26:33,280 --> 06:26:34,798
so this is kind of like where the actual

7380
06:26:34,798 --> 06:26:37,280
rubber meets the road for ideas that are

7381
06:26:37,280 --> 06:26:40,320
born in academia getting applied by real

7382
06:26:40,320 --> 06:26:42,558
software devs that probably had trouble

7383
06:26:42,558 --> 06:26:45,280
graduating from high school

7384
06:26:45,280 --> 06:26:46,878
and it works on real software that goes

7385
06:26:46,878 --> 06:26:48,878
into production and manages hundreds of

7386
06:26:48,878 --> 06:26:50,958
millions of dollars right there's just

7387
06:26:50,958 --> 06:26:52,558
something absurd about this whole

7388
06:26:52,558 --> 06:26:55,040
situation

7389
06:26:55,040 --> 06:26:56,958
so in order to figure out where like

7390
06:26:56,958 --> 06:26:58,958
where this came from we have to digress

7391
06:26:58,958 --> 06:27:00,320
a little bit further talk about what a

7392
06:27:00,320 --> 06:27:02,000
program is like let's do computer

7393
06:27:02,000 --> 06:27:03,360
science one-on-one here bring you back

7394
06:27:03,360 --> 06:27:05,200
to like freshman cs

7395
06:27:05,200 --> 06:27:07,200
so what's a program it's very nuanced

7396
06:27:07,200 --> 06:27:08,558
but we're at summer con so i'm not going

7397
06:27:08,558 --> 06:27:10,478
to go into too much detail

7398
06:27:10,478 --> 06:27:12,080
but let's just say

7399
06:27:12,080 --> 06:27:14,160
that we've got input variables that

7400
06:27:14,160 --> 06:27:15,840
change how a program behaves it changes

7401
06:27:15,840 --> 06:27:17,520
some state variables

7402
06:27:17,520 --> 06:27:19,440
which has some effects and maybe it

7403
06:27:19,440 --> 06:27:21,040
stops or maybe it doesn't so you can

7404
06:27:21,040 --> 06:27:22,798
kind of visualize this

7405
06:27:22,798 --> 06:27:24,638
input red dot

7406
06:27:24,638 --> 06:27:27,520
state machine bounces around maybe stops

7407
06:27:27,520 --> 06:27:30,400
maybe doesn't right

7408
06:27:30,400 --> 06:27:31,920
so if you think about security what's

7409
06:27:31,920 --> 06:27:33,680
security if you believe that's what a

7410
06:27:33,680 --> 06:27:36,000
program is well security is pretty easy

7411
06:27:36,000 --> 06:27:38,638
either you are shrinking the input space

7412
06:27:38,638 --> 06:27:40,958
or you are testing various portions of

7413
06:27:40,958 --> 06:27:42,638
it to eliminate bugs in the state

7414
06:27:42,638 --> 06:27:44,958
machine behind it that's it that is

7415
06:27:44,958 --> 06:27:48,320
security in one slide

7416
06:27:48,320 --> 06:27:50,240
uh and side note where do mitigations

7417
06:27:50,240 --> 06:27:52,478
fit in they don't they don't fix code

7418
06:27:52,478 --> 06:27:53,920
they just

7419
06:27:53,920 --> 06:27:55,120
honestly they don't do a whole lot of

7420
06:27:55,120 --> 06:27:58,320
anything but that's another talk

7421
06:27:58,320 --> 06:27:59,120
so

7422
06:27:59,120 --> 06:28:01,280
what do people do on this like maturity

7423
06:28:01,280 --> 06:28:03,600
path to getting to tested code well they

7424
06:28:03,600 --> 06:28:05,600
usually they usually say well i could

7425
06:28:05,600 --> 06:28:07,680
get better software if i just send all

7426
06:28:07,680 --> 06:28:09,680
my devs out to training or if i just

7427
06:28:09,680 --> 06:28:11,840
hired better people or if i if everybody

7428
06:28:11,840 --> 06:28:14,000
goes back to school and like learns

7429
06:28:14,000 --> 06:28:16,160
about some new [ __ ] and they figure out

7430
06:28:16,160 --> 06:28:17,600
how to write code with less bugs in it

7431
06:28:17,600 --> 06:28:19,600
but that absolutely does not work right

7432
06:28:19,600 --> 06:28:21,520
that's kind of like the same version of

7433
06:28:21,520 --> 06:28:23,200
a manager saying oh well you know your

7434
06:28:23,200 --> 06:28:25,040
job is hard we'll just try harder of

7435
06:28:25,040 --> 06:28:26,558
course it'll work out

7436
06:28:26,558 --> 06:28:28,000
so that that totally doesn't work it's

7437
06:28:28,000 --> 06:28:30,718
have your existing programmers work hard

7438
06:28:30,718 --> 06:28:34,000
work harder in the same amount of time

7439
06:28:34,000 --> 06:28:35,440
so eventually most people get the

7440
06:28:35,440 --> 06:28:36,878
religion and they figure out oh i should

7441
06:28:36,878 --> 06:28:38,558
test stuff and then they write some unit

7442
06:28:38,558 --> 06:28:40,400
tests and they pop a bunch of holes in

7443
06:28:40,400 --> 06:28:41,920
the input space

7444
06:28:41,920 --> 06:28:43,920
it's considerably better than the

7445
06:28:43,920 --> 06:28:45,840
previous step but it's still like you

7446
06:28:45,840 --> 06:28:47,600
don't know what you don't know

7447
06:28:47,600 --> 06:28:49,120
you can't make a secure piece of so you

7448
06:28:49,120 --> 06:28:50,718
can't make a software secure if all

7449
06:28:50,718 --> 06:28:52,240
you're doing is randomly testing the

7450
06:28:52,240 --> 06:28:54,000
happy paths

7451
06:28:54,000 --> 06:28:55,360
so

7452
06:28:55,360 --> 06:28:57,520
this though it's kind of like this is

7453
06:28:57,520 --> 06:28:59,040
like the state of the art like i don't

7454
06:28:59,040 --> 06:29:00,478
know if you guys test software the way

7455
06:29:00,478 --> 06:29:02,000
the trailer bits test software but when

7456
06:29:02,000 --> 06:29:03,680
we walk into a project

7457
06:29:03,680 --> 06:29:05,360
where they've got unit tests they're

7458
06:29:05,360 --> 06:29:07,440
proud of it like this is amazing they're

7459
06:29:07,440 --> 06:29:09,280
like oh yeah like high five like you'll

7460
06:29:09,280 --> 06:29:11,600
list it on a careers page

7461
06:29:11,600 --> 06:29:13,200
when you've got unit tests like you

7462
06:29:13,200 --> 06:29:14,718
should work here because we test our

7463
06:29:14,718 --> 06:29:16,638
code right

7464
06:29:16,638 --> 06:29:17,760
so that's kind of like where most the

7465
06:29:17,760 --> 06:29:19,280
industry is

7466
06:29:19,280 --> 06:29:20,000
but

7467
06:29:20,000 --> 06:29:21,840
now you're starting to see that a few

7468
06:29:21,840 --> 06:29:23,520
more people have found the light and

7469
06:29:23,520 --> 06:29:24,878
they're starting to fuzz test their code

7470
06:29:24,878 --> 06:29:26,798
so it's getting a lot more popular so

7471
06:29:26,798 --> 06:29:28,878
everybody that uses a fuzzer always says

7472
06:29:28,878 --> 06:29:30,798
they're amazing nobody says like oh yeah

7473
06:29:30,798 --> 06:29:33,280
you know i tried afl and it sucked

7474
06:29:33,280 --> 06:29:34,080
no

7475
06:29:34,080 --> 06:29:36,478
they say our lord and savior afl like

7476
06:29:36,478 --> 06:29:38,400
five minutes later after they run it so

7477
06:29:38,400 --> 06:29:39,680
it's great that it's getting a lot of

7478
06:29:39,680 --> 06:29:41,120
industry acceptance there's like a

7479
06:29:41,120 --> 06:29:43,600
million forks of afl by every academic

7480
06:29:43,600 --> 06:29:45,520
lab in the country trying to find

7481
06:29:45,520 --> 06:29:47,360
different generation strategies to make

7482
06:29:47,360 --> 06:29:49,200
it more efficient so like it's kind of a

7483
06:29:49,200 --> 06:29:50,478
big deal but it's only just at the

7484
06:29:50,478 --> 06:29:51,920
beginning i don't really walk into too

7485
06:29:51,920 --> 06:29:53,920
many clients that have a fuzz test

7486
06:29:53,920 --> 06:29:55,600
harness where they've actually thought

7487
06:29:55,600 --> 06:29:58,080
through what they're doing

7488
06:29:58,080 --> 06:30:00,718
and then last is if you made it that far

7489
06:30:00,718 --> 06:30:02,478
and not many people do

7490
06:30:02,478 --> 06:30:04,000
you can actually verify some of your

7491
06:30:04,000 --> 06:30:05,840
code and that's where we could wipe out

7492
06:30:05,840 --> 06:30:08,000
huge swaths of the input space and

7493
06:30:08,000 --> 06:30:09,840
guarantee that there aren't there aren't

7494
06:30:09,840 --> 06:30:12,320
problems in those areas obviously like

7495
06:30:12,320 --> 06:30:13,680
sometimes you mess up and you don't

7496
06:30:13,680 --> 06:30:15,520
exactly look at all the inputs you get a

7497
06:30:15,520 --> 06:30:17,520
little box off on the right

7498
06:30:17,520 --> 06:30:20,160
uh where you know what sure you might

7499
06:30:20,160 --> 06:30:21,680
miss some stuff like that but this is

7500
06:30:21,680 --> 06:30:23,280
strictly better than the step that came

7501
06:30:23,280 --> 06:30:26,000
before it obviously

7502
06:30:26,000 --> 06:30:27,200
so the industry doesn't really want to

7503
06:30:27,200 --> 06:30:31,280
do this right this is wildly impractical

7504
06:30:31,520 --> 06:30:33,920
so again reality check pretty much

7505
06:30:33,920 --> 06:30:36,558
everybody's at phase zero some people

7506
06:30:36,558 --> 06:30:39,280
write unit tests fewer do fuzzing and

7507
06:30:39,280 --> 06:30:40,718
even the people that do fuzzing don't do

7508
06:30:40,718 --> 06:30:43,120
it well we have a great research project

7509
06:30:43,120 --> 06:30:45,520
from uh artem dynaberg at trailer bits

7510
06:30:45,520 --> 06:30:47,520
where he resurrected the original fuzzer

7511
06:30:47,520 --> 06:30:49,440
from the university of washington and

7512
06:30:49,440 --> 06:30:51,440
re-ran it on linux utilities that were

7513
06:30:51,440 --> 06:30:52,718
exactly

7514
06:30:52,718 --> 06:30:55,760
uh like the lineage from the the

7515
06:30:55,760 --> 06:30:58,400
utilities they tested back in 1989

7516
06:30:58,400 --> 06:30:59,760
still finds bugs

7517
06:30:59,760 --> 06:31:01,200
right like

7518
06:31:01,200 --> 06:31:03,120
people aren't exactly great at applying

7519
06:31:03,120 --> 06:31:04,718
these kinds of things when new research

7520
06:31:04,718 --> 06:31:07,920
comes out and then phase three like

7521
06:31:07,920 --> 06:31:09,280
raise your hand if you've ever worked on

7522
06:31:09,280 --> 06:31:11,440
a verified piece of software like nobody

7523
06:31:11,440 --> 06:31:13,600
right

7524
06:31:14,718 --> 06:31:17,200
so why is that why do we suck so much

7525
06:31:17,200 --> 06:31:19,040
like why why did the blockchain people

7526
06:31:19,040 --> 06:31:22,400
figure this out and why did we not

7527
06:31:25,120 --> 06:31:25,840
so

7528
06:31:25,840 --> 06:31:27,760
first thing is that every part of a prop

7529
06:31:27,760 --> 06:31:29,600
program has some kind of logic in it

7530
06:31:29,600 --> 06:31:31,200
like what information changes how the

7531
06:31:31,200 --> 06:31:33,280
code works i don't know like there's

7532
06:31:33,280 --> 06:31:35,120
inputs coming in from every single

7533
06:31:35,120 --> 06:31:36,478
location you've got environment

7534
06:31:36,478 --> 06:31:39,360
variables network data user input like

7535
06:31:39,360 --> 06:31:41,600
and you just you can't figure out where

7536
06:31:41,600 --> 06:31:43,280
the input space even is to start

7537
06:31:43,280 --> 06:31:46,320
adequately testing it

7538
06:31:46,320 --> 06:31:47,840
and everybody mixes all their logic

7539
06:31:47,840 --> 06:31:49,840
together into a global mutable state so

7540
06:31:49,840 --> 06:31:52,400
like system d is the really good example

7541
06:31:52,400 --> 06:31:53,920
here like what does systemd do wrong

7542
06:31:53,920 --> 06:31:55,440
that makes it insane

7543
06:31:55,440 --> 06:31:57,680
nothing is pure everything has side

7544
06:31:57,680 --> 06:31:58,638
effects

7545
06:31:58,638 --> 06:32:00,878
and there's tons of mutable states so

7546
06:32:00,878 --> 06:32:02,798
you can't know what it does all you can

7547
06:32:02,798 --> 06:32:04,718
do is observe its behavior and how it

7548
06:32:04,718 --> 06:32:06,478
responds to certain inputs and hope you

7549
06:32:06,478 --> 06:32:09,520
can trace back what the bug is

7550
06:32:09,520 --> 06:32:10,878
uh

7551
06:32:10,878 --> 06:32:12,718
let me think i yeah there we go

7552
06:32:12,718 --> 06:32:15,040
schrodinger systemd right like this is

7553
06:32:15,040 --> 06:32:17,200
just a really good example of where

7554
06:32:17,200 --> 06:32:20,798
stuff is for regular software

7555
06:32:20,798 --> 06:32:22,160
and that points to a larger problem of

7556
06:32:22,160 --> 06:32:24,160
reproducibility so there's wildly

7557
06:32:24,160 --> 06:32:26,160
different uh security properties you

7558
06:32:26,160 --> 06:32:27,520
might get from a piece of software if

7559
06:32:27,520 --> 06:32:28,840
you compile it with two different

7560
06:32:28,840 --> 06:32:31,280
compilers uh most people might not even

7561
06:32:31,280 --> 06:32:33,120
distribute software with a make file

7562
06:32:33,120 --> 06:32:35,280
like on a software audit how many times

7563
06:32:35,280 --> 06:32:36,798
have you been given a list of build

7564
06:32:36,798 --> 06:32:38,718
instructions that's just a pdf printout

7565
06:32:38,718 --> 06:32:41,040
from some jira ticket from like 10 years

7566
06:32:41,040 --> 06:32:43,120
ago that only works on that devs machine

7567
06:32:43,120 --> 06:32:45,200
right i can tell you from trail of bits

7568
06:32:45,200 --> 06:32:47,920
the number is high

7569
06:32:48,000 --> 06:32:49,520
and then you frequently ask the

7570
06:32:49,520 --> 06:32:50,958
environment to perform a whole bunch of

7571
06:32:50,958 --> 06:32:53,760
logic for you right like you outsource

7572
06:32:53,760 --> 06:32:56,718
your logic to uh allocate memory to read

7573
06:32:56,718 --> 06:32:58,798
from the network it's not in your code

7574
06:32:58,798 --> 06:33:01,280
you have to trust somebody else to do it

7575
06:33:01,280 --> 06:33:02,718
and then you might take no care to

7576
06:33:02,718 --> 06:33:04,160
actually determine if the environment

7577
06:33:04,160 --> 06:33:06,000
responded appropriately

7578
06:33:06,000 --> 06:33:08,478
and that's where tools like will's

7579
06:33:08,478 --> 06:33:13,478
krf will totally kill your program

7580
06:33:13,680 --> 06:33:14,958
and then the input space is just

7581
06:33:14,958 --> 06:33:16,718
dramatically large right it's really

7582
06:33:16,718 --> 06:33:18,798
easy to test something that's like you

7583
06:33:18,798 --> 06:33:20,320
know one inch large in my little

7584
06:33:20,320 --> 06:33:22,000
diagrams here it's really hard to test

7585
06:33:22,000 --> 06:33:23,600
something that's like a you know the

7586
06:33:23,600 --> 06:33:25,760
size of this projector view

7587
06:33:25,760 --> 06:33:27,280
so programmers don't know what stuff

7588
06:33:27,280 --> 06:33:28,798
changes the behavior of their program

7589
06:33:28,798 --> 06:33:30,240
and they also expect everything to be

7590
06:33:30,240 --> 06:33:32,798
referentially transparent so if you have

7591
06:33:32,798 --> 06:33:35,360
if you evaluate like f of x then you

7592
06:33:35,360 --> 06:33:37,760
expect to always get y and it's just not

7593
06:33:37,760 --> 06:33:39,520
true

7594
06:33:39,520 --> 06:33:40,558
um

7595
06:33:40,558 --> 06:33:42,240
a lot of a lot of like novice

7596
06:33:42,240 --> 06:33:43,600
programmers they might do things like

7597
06:33:43,600 --> 06:33:45,680
identify things by a string type now

7598
06:33:45,680 --> 06:33:47,680
you've got white space bugs

7599
06:33:47,680 --> 06:33:49,200
and then as soon as you have a null

7600
06:33:49,200 --> 06:33:50,878
anything can be a null

7601
06:33:50,878 --> 06:33:52,718
so you'll encounter tons of bad stuff if

7602
06:33:52,718 --> 06:33:54,400
you don't check for it so that makes the

7603
06:33:54,400 --> 06:33:57,440
input space massive

7604
06:33:58,080 --> 06:34:00,958
so with all that stuff in mind

7605
06:34:00,958 --> 06:34:02,400
let's take a look

7606
06:34:02,400 --> 06:34:05,040
oh i'm gonna

7607
06:34:06,840 --> 06:34:09,200
barf let's look at blockchain as the

7608
06:34:09,200 --> 06:34:10,320
future

7609
06:34:10,320 --> 06:34:12,000
so literally

7610
06:34:12,000 --> 06:34:14,320
engineering on blockchain does not

7611
06:34:14,320 --> 06:34:16,000
support the obstacles that we just

7612
06:34:16,000 --> 06:34:18,240
talked about it's just not a supported

7613
06:34:18,240 --> 06:34:20,638
feature those those problems which makes

7614
06:34:20,638 --> 06:34:22,400
it kind of unique

7615
06:34:22,400 --> 06:34:24,000
so first off properties of a smart

7616
06:34:24,000 --> 06:34:26,080
contract a lot of people they say that

7617
06:34:26,080 --> 06:34:27,920
oh you know this code is law so like

7618
06:34:27,920 --> 06:34:29,760
that's why all this stuff is like much

7619
06:34:29,760 --> 06:34:32,160
different but like no that's not it and

7620
06:34:32,160 --> 06:34:33,520
i'm giving this presentation

7621
06:34:33,520 --> 06:34:35,440
specifically to give you a more nuanced

7622
06:34:35,440 --> 06:34:37,760
understanding of why the code is law

7623
06:34:37,760 --> 06:34:40,080
thing is [ __ ] and why it's actual

7624
06:34:40,080 --> 06:34:42,478
engineering differences in the way that

7625
06:34:42,478 --> 06:34:43,760
people build blockchain software that

7626
06:34:43,760 --> 06:34:46,240
make it much more safe

7627
06:34:46,240 --> 06:34:48,878
so the main thing the main incentive is

7628
06:34:48,878 --> 06:34:51,200
that all this stuff costs money as you

7629
06:34:51,200 --> 06:34:53,200
get larger

7630
06:34:53,200 --> 06:34:54,798
which is kind of odd because like maybe

7631
06:34:54,798 --> 06:34:57,120
that does mean that uh incentives are

7632
06:34:57,120 --> 06:34:58,878
the reason why correctness kind of works

7633
06:34:58,878 --> 06:34:59,760
here

7634
06:34:59,760 --> 06:35:00,798
right

7635
06:35:00,798 --> 06:35:02,558
so code is tiny it has almost no control

7636
06:35:02,558 --> 06:35:04,240
flow because there are incentives for it

7637
06:35:04,240 --> 06:35:06,400
to remain small so this screenshot on

7638
06:35:06,400 --> 06:35:08,478
the right that's from a

7639
06:35:08,478 --> 06:35:09,920
program that trailer bits put out called

7640
06:35:09,920 --> 06:35:12,798
ethersplay and that program actually

7641
06:35:12,798 --> 06:35:14,958
does something important for a smart

7642
06:35:14,958 --> 06:35:16,638
contract it's like

7643
06:35:16,638 --> 06:35:19,120
30 lines of disassemble code but it does

7644
06:35:19,120 --> 06:35:20,558
something important and you can read it

7645
06:35:20,558 --> 06:35:22,240
and you can analyze it and you can test

7646
06:35:22,240 --> 06:35:25,600
against it and that has value in in

7647
06:35:25,600 --> 06:35:27,520
the smart contract ecosystem where you

7648
06:35:27,520 --> 06:35:29,200
wouldn't be able to isolate a function

7649
06:35:29,200 --> 06:35:33,080
like that in internet explorer

7650
06:35:33,440 --> 06:35:35,280
uh we've also got manageable state

7651
06:35:35,280 --> 06:35:38,080
spaces like this isn't some superbly

7652
06:35:38,080 --> 06:35:40,478
clever design it's just that there are

7653
06:35:40,478 --> 06:35:42,240
constraints to get around the fact that

7654
06:35:42,240 --> 06:35:44,478
all this distributed systems voodoo

7655
06:35:44,478 --> 06:35:45,920
stuff that the blockchain people are

7656
06:35:45,920 --> 06:35:48,400
dealing with doesn't scale and the fact

7657
06:35:48,400 --> 06:35:49,840
that it doesn't scale means that you've

7658
06:35:49,840 --> 06:35:51,200
got

7659
06:35:51,200 --> 06:35:53,520
small transaction data you've got

7660
06:35:53,520 --> 06:35:55,360
state variables that are that you can

7661
06:35:55,360 --> 06:35:58,558
count on one hand sometimes

7662
06:35:58,558 --> 06:36:00,638
and generally this whole thing ends up

7663
06:36:00,638 --> 06:36:02,558
in an environment where it's much easier

7664
06:36:02,558 --> 06:36:04,240
to test

7665
06:36:04,240 --> 06:36:05,760
so yeah from back of an envelope math

7666
06:36:05,760 --> 06:36:07,440
perspective they're in a great space

7667
06:36:07,440 --> 06:36:09,840
because they don't scale

7668
06:36:09,840 --> 06:36:11,920
uh so like where does this lead you this

7669
06:36:11,920 --> 06:36:14,240
leads you to symbolic execution being

7670
06:36:14,240 --> 06:36:16,558
possibly the most applied technique in

7671
06:36:16,558 --> 06:36:18,798
the space like when we work with i don't

7672
06:36:18,798 --> 06:36:20,000
want to put anybody on the spot but

7673
06:36:20,000 --> 06:36:21,280
there's a company in the audience right

7674
06:36:21,280 --> 06:36:24,000
now who gave us a smart contract

7675
06:36:24,000 --> 06:36:24,958
that

7676
06:36:24,958 --> 06:36:28,320
alongside it gave us 99 test coverage

7677
06:36:28,320 --> 06:36:30,478
for a symbolic execution test suite

7678
06:36:30,478 --> 06:36:33,600
before we even did an audit right like

7679
06:36:33,600 --> 06:36:35,200
it's kind of challenging it's kind of

7680
06:36:35,200 --> 06:36:36,478
like when a client comes in the door and

7681
06:36:36,478 --> 06:36:38,798
they say oh yeah here go ahead find some

7682
06:36:38,798 --> 06:36:40,558
bugs in this like that's the position

7683
06:36:40,558 --> 06:36:42,878
you want to be in as an auditor not

7684
06:36:42,878 --> 06:36:44,478
somebody who just like dips their hand

7685
06:36:44,478 --> 06:36:48,000
in the bucket and pulls out like 20 bugs

7686
06:36:48,000 --> 06:36:51,360
so evm has a few dozen more op codes

7687
06:36:51,360 --> 06:36:52,798
than brain [ __ ] but it's kind of the

7688
06:36:52,798 --> 06:36:54,798
same thing like you could ride an evm

7689
06:36:54,798 --> 06:36:56,718
symbolic executor in a weekend if you

7690
06:36:56,718 --> 06:36:58,878
had a few sleepless nights

7691
06:36:58,878 --> 06:37:00,320
verse like

7692
06:37:00,320 --> 06:37:01,520
how many people in here have wrote a

7693
06:37:01,520 --> 06:37:05,280
symbolic executor for x86

7694
06:37:05,280 --> 06:37:07,600
what

7695
06:37:08,478 --> 06:37:10,638
yeah thanks

7696
06:37:10,638 --> 06:37:12,638
uh so yeah the move instruction has like

7697
06:37:12,638 --> 06:37:15,040
50 different versions of it so even that

7698
06:37:15,040 --> 06:37:16,798
instruction by itself is probably more

7699
06:37:16,798 --> 06:37:18,798
complicated than evm

7700
06:37:18,798 --> 06:37:20,000
and the neatest part about all this

7701
06:37:20,000 --> 06:37:21,920
stuff is that any random developer can

7702
06:37:21,920 --> 06:37:24,320
pick up a symbolic executor and do dot

7703
06:37:24,320 --> 06:37:26,878
slash find bugs and they get results out

7704
06:37:26,878 --> 06:37:28,160
of it

7705
06:37:28,160 --> 06:37:30,160
so you can paste like yeah you can do

7706
06:37:30,160 --> 06:37:31,600
weird stuff like you can paste your

7707
06:37:31,600 --> 06:37:33,680
smart contract code into a web browser

7708
06:37:33,680 --> 06:37:35,440
and you can get a symbolic executor that

7709
06:37:35,440 --> 06:37:36,878
runs in the cloud to tell you where the

7710
06:37:36,878 --> 06:37:40,878
bugs are like it's crazy

7711
06:37:44,798 --> 06:37:46,638
we've also got fuzzers buzzers are

7712
06:37:46,638 --> 06:37:48,400
widely available and used by pretty much

7713
06:37:48,400 --> 06:37:49,440
everybody

7714
06:37:49,440 --> 06:37:51,600
the hardest part about fuzzing is

7715
06:37:51,600 --> 06:37:54,240
finding a way to execute the code

7716
06:37:54,240 --> 06:37:55,680
that's like a little bit of a hurdle to

7717
06:37:55,680 --> 06:37:57,120
jump through but it's just a matter of

7718
06:37:57,120 --> 06:37:59,760
calling a json rpc interface

7719
06:37:59,760 --> 06:38:01,120
at the end of the day

7720
06:38:01,120 --> 06:38:02,798
it's probably

7721
06:38:02,798 --> 06:38:04,718
in a lot of ways so this is the [ __ ]

7722
06:38:04,718 --> 06:38:06,320
up part in a lot of ways fuzzing is

7723
06:38:06,320 --> 06:38:08,320
actually kind of harder

7724
06:38:08,320 --> 06:38:11,200
in this environment because

7725
06:38:11,200 --> 06:38:13,680
what does what does bad stuff look like

7726
06:38:13,680 --> 06:38:16,080
right like on x86 what does bad stuff

7727
06:38:16,080 --> 06:38:18,080
look like it looks like a crash

7728
06:38:18,080 --> 06:38:19,680
so you can very easily write your fuzzer

7729
06:38:19,680 --> 06:38:21,200
to just look at crashes and then you're

7730
06:38:21,200 --> 06:38:22,320
you're done you don't have to write any

7731
06:38:22,320 --> 06:38:24,558
heuristics like you know what bed looks

7732
06:38:24,558 --> 06:38:25,280
like

7733
06:38:25,280 --> 06:38:26,878
on a smart contract what does bed look

7734
06:38:26,878 --> 06:38:28,478
like well i don't know i have to write a

7735
06:38:28,478 --> 06:38:30,160
whole bunch of properties for it to seek

7736
06:38:30,160 --> 06:38:32,638
out when it executes

7737
06:38:32,638 --> 06:38:34,400
so it kind of leads me to this belief

7738
06:38:34,400 --> 06:38:36,160
that when the environment is more

7739
06:38:36,160 --> 06:38:38,240
testable it's actually easier to do the

7740
06:38:38,240 --> 06:38:39,920
right thing in this case symbolic

7741
06:38:39,920 --> 06:38:42,478
execution

7742
06:38:42,798 --> 06:38:44,400
and then static analysis basically plays

7743
06:38:44,400 --> 06:38:46,718
out the same uh solidity is really

7744
06:38:46,718 --> 06:38:48,478
amenable to the simplest possible static

7745
06:38:48,478 --> 06:38:51,200
analyzer you can parse it turn it into a

7746
06:38:51,200 --> 06:38:53,040
set of expressions and then look at who

7747
06:38:53,040 --> 06:38:54,878
writes the state variables and that will

7748
06:38:54,878 --> 06:38:56,478
find you bugs

7749
06:38:56,478 --> 06:38:58,958
uh in the early days slither the trailer

7750
06:38:58,958 --> 06:39:01,600
bits static analyzer just parse stuff to

7751
06:39:01,600 --> 06:39:03,200
an ast and then recurse through that

7752
06:39:03,200 --> 06:39:04,638
running simple queries and that kind of

7753
06:39:04,638 --> 06:39:06,478
just ran fine

7754
06:39:06,478 --> 06:39:08,320
so this stuff the environment the

7755
06:39:08,320 --> 06:39:10,240
engineering the way that they designed

7756
06:39:10,240 --> 06:39:14,478
this made all these analyses simple

7757
06:39:14,798 --> 06:39:16,638
so big picture we have three tools they

7758
06:39:16,638 --> 06:39:18,558
all find truckloads of bugs and at one

7759
06:39:18,558 --> 06:39:20,240
point we had to make a big spreadsheet

7760
06:39:20,240 --> 06:39:22,000
to track all the zero day that we were

7761
06:39:22,000 --> 06:39:24,080
balancing inside trailer bits

7762
06:39:24,080 --> 06:39:26,000
when we demo these things at conferences

7763
06:39:26,000 --> 06:39:28,160
devs get jealous they closed their lap

7764
06:39:28,160 --> 06:39:30,080
or actually they closed their telegram

7765
06:39:30,080 --> 06:39:31,760
because they all use telegram

7766
06:39:31,760 --> 06:39:33,120
and they run one of our tools during the

7767
06:39:33,120 --> 06:39:34,958
presentation and come up to me afterward

7768
06:39:34,958 --> 06:39:37,360
and tell me about it

7769
06:39:37,360 --> 06:39:39,360
we have more projects where we have to

7770
06:39:39,360 --> 06:39:41,920
try really hard to find bugs

7771
06:39:41,920 --> 06:39:43,760
because they've already run tools like

7772
06:39:43,760 --> 06:39:45,760
this and found all the easy stuff so

7773
06:39:45,760 --> 06:39:46,558
people

7774
06:39:46,558 --> 06:39:48,160
who are taking it seriously are getting

7775
06:39:48,160 --> 06:39:50,478
really good at it and uh we just don't

7776
06:39:50,478 --> 06:39:53,360
have conventional software clients that

7777
06:39:53,360 --> 06:39:55,440
test their code as as good as blockchain

7778
06:39:55,440 --> 06:39:58,320
people do

7779
06:39:58,320 --> 06:39:59,920
so in summary

7780
06:39:59,920 --> 06:40:03,440
this is what real performance looks like

7781
06:40:04,080 --> 06:40:06,798
uh so

7782
06:40:06,798 --> 06:40:08,798
i'm ending here uh there's a larger part

7783
06:40:08,798 --> 06:40:10,240
of this presentation i'm happy to talk

7784
06:40:10,240 --> 06:40:12,798
about at some point or at the bar but uh

7785
06:40:12,798 --> 06:40:14,558
generally you should join us if you have

7786
06:40:14,558 --> 06:40:16,958
any interest whatsoever in applying

7787
06:40:16,958 --> 06:40:18,718
research to make software more secure

7788
06:40:18,718 --> 06:40:20,558
you should join trailer bits and you can

7789
06:40:20,558 --> 06:40:22,000
hear about a lot of the ways that we do

7790
06:40:22,000 --> 06:40:24,558
that on our brand new podcast which you

7791
06:40:24,558 --> 06:40:26,638
can find on any podcasting platform or

7792
06:40:26,638 --> 06:40:29,600
on trailerbits.audio uh we have one

7793
06:40:29,600 --> 06:40:31,280
called the future where we talk about

7794
06:40:31,280 --> 06:40:32,878
some of the ways that we use automated

7795
06:40:32,878 --> 06:40:34,958
testing techniques to evaluate our

7796
06:40:34,958 --> 06:40:36,400
clients code not just for blockchain

7797
06:40:36,400 --> 06:40:38,718
software but for everybody else too

7798
06:40:38,718 --> 06:40:39,520
uh

7799
06:40:39,520 --> 06:40:41,360
and that's it so thanks a lot i hope you

7800
06:40:41,360 --> 06:40:43,200
didn't get too wasted with all the

7801
06:40:43,200 --> 06:40:44,718
blockchains

7802
06:40:44,718 --> 06:40:47,718
thanks

7803
06:40:56,000 --> 06:40:59,040
all right how late was i

7804
06:41:00,080 --> 06:41:03,200
on time sweet

7805
06:41:05,680 --> 06:41:08,558
so uh not taking questions i could take

7806
06:41:08,558 --> 06:41:09,520
questions

7807
06:41:09,520 --> 06:41:11,680
any any questions anybody want to yell

7808
06:41:11,680 --> 06:41:14,000
at me

7809
06:41:14,798 --> 06:41:16,320
what

7810
06:41:16,320 --> 06:41:18,400
when does number go down

7811
06:41:18,400 --> 06:41:21,840
number goes down uh now i mean

7812
06:41:21,840 --> 06:41:23,760
everything is basically

7813
06:41:23,760 --> 06:41:25,760
i can use my coinbase account to pay for

7814
06:41:25,760 --> 06:41:27,120
a beer at the bar and i'm basically

7815
06:41:27,120 --> 06:41:30,120
bankrupt

7816
06:41:36,080 --> 06:41:38,478
uh yeah i mean there's a bunch that have

7817
06:41:38,478 --> 06:41:40,080
better design like they're less evolved

7818
06:41:40,080 --> 06:41:41,440
they're more designed

7819
06:41:41,440 --> 06:41:43,200
the question was what do you think about

7820
06:41:43,200 --> 06:41:44,878
other programming languages

7821
06:41:44,878 --> 06:41:47,760
in blockchain like move or starkware or

7822
06:41:47,760 --> 06:41:50,160
cairo or that kind of stuff and what

7823
06:41:50,160 --> 06:41:51,440
should really be clear from this

7824
06:41:51,440 --> 06:41:53,600
presentation is a lot of the traditional

7825
06:41:53,600 --> 06:41:54,958
software people they tell you that oh

7826
06:41:54,958 --> 06:41:56,958
like we would be secure if we only had

7827
06:41:56,958 --> 06:41:58,958
compilers that like guaranteed safety we

7828
06:41:58,958 --> 06:42:00,400
had better development environments and

7829
06:42:00,400 --> 06:42:01,520
like

7830
06:42:01,520 --> 06:42:03,920
what blockchain proves is no actually

7831
06:42:03,920 --> 06:42:05,520
you don't need any of that stuff you can

7832
06:42:05,520 --> 06:42:08,400
fix everything everything in post

7833
06:42:08,400 --> 06:42:11,520
you can test away all the bugs and still

7834
06:42:11,520 --> 06:42:13,120
end up with secure code even when all

7835
06:42:13,120 --> 06:42:15,360
the tools you build with are broken

7836
06:42:15,360 --> 06:42:16,718
so the question

7837
06:42:16,718 --> 06:42:18,958
really belays the fact that it's not a

7838
06:42:18,958 --> 06:42:21,840
question of either or why not both

7839
06:42:21,840 --> 06:42:23,840
right we can test really well and we can

7840
06:42:23,840 --> 06:42:25,760
have tools that help us develop code

7841
06:42:25,760 --> 06:42:27,520
really well and then we'll probably even

7842
06:42:27,520 --> 06:42:28,160
it

7843
06:42:28,160 --> 06:42:30,478
in an even better state so languages

7844
06:42:30,478 --> 06:42:32,718
like move or or some of the other

7845
06:42:32,718 --> 06:42:34,160
blockchain languages offer that

7846
06:42:34,160 --> 06:42:36,160
opportunity i think at this point it's a

7847
06:42:36,160 --> 06:42:37,760
question of whether the market moves

7848
06:42:37,760 --> 06:42:39,040
behind them

7849
06:42:39,040 --> 06:42:41,200
uh and whether they survive the many

7850
06:42:41,200 --> 06:42:43,520
transitions that facebook slash meta has

7851
06:42:43,520 --> 06:42:45,120
put it through

7852
06:42:45,120 --> 06:42:47,440
but i'm i'm hoping that we we eventually

7853
06:42:47,440 --> 06:42:49,040
move away from solidity and then we get

7854
06:42:49,040 --> 06:42:52,520
best of both worlds

7855
06:43:05,440 --> 06:43:07,200
all right yeah

7856
06:43:07,200 --> 06:43:09,840
perry's trying to nail me on terms here

7857
06:43:09,840 --> 06:43:11,280
but like this is summer con and you

7858
06:43:11,280 --> 06:43:12,798
should just drink for asking me that

7859
06:43:12,798 --> 06:43:13,850
question

7860
06:43:13,850 --> 06:43:17,239
[Laughter]

7861
06:43:18,718 --> 06:43:20,400
uh something about

7862
06:43:20,400 --> 06:43:22,478
symbolic execution and static analysis

7863
06:43:22,478 --> 06:43:24,558
being dynamic and l or fuzzing and

7864
06:43:24,558 --> 06:43:25,920
symbolic execution being dynamic

7865
06:43:25,920 --> 06:43:27,600
analyses and aren't they both the same

7866
06:43:27,600 --> 06:43:29,520
thing and like ah kind of

7867
06:43:29,520 --> 06:43:31,280
i mean automated test generation is a

7868
06:43:31,280 --> 06:43:32,798
big field if you really want to pull up

7869
06:43:32,798 --> 06:43:34,160
the umbrella

7870
06:43:34,160 --> 06:43:38,638
oh no now i got another one just like it

7871
06:43:41,600 --> 06:43:44,877
how many tests can you do

7872
06:43:45,120 --> 06:43:47,360
how many tests per second so actually

7873
06:43:47,360 --> 06:43:50,320
the trailer bits podcast episode three

7874
06:43:50,320 --> 06:43:52,240
has a interview with an intern that

7875
06:43:52,240 --> 06:43:53,840
managed to increase the performance of

7876
06:43:53,840 --> 06:43:56,478
our fuzzer by 10x in three weeks

7877
06:43:56,478 --> 06:43:58,160
uh so right now

7878
06:43:58,160 --> 06:43:59,840
the transactions per second that we can

7879
06:43:59,840 --> 06:44:01,600
pump through is really low but because

7880
06:44:01,600 --> 06:44:02,878
the number of state variables and the

7881
06:44:02,878 --> 06:44:04,718
transaction size and the code size and

7882
06:44:04,718 --> 06:44:06,478
everything are tiny it almost doesn't

7883
06:44:06,478 --> 06:44:08,718
matter like the speed was never an issue

7884
06:44:08,718 --> 06:44:09,600
for us

7885
06:44:09,600 --> 06:44:11,280
but there's huge gains that we could

7886
06:44:11,280 --> 06:44:13,520
make if we actually focused on

7887
06:44:13,520 --> 06:44:14,718
performance we could get an

7888
06:44:14,718 --> 06:44:16,878
extraordinarily better fuzzer but i

7889
06:44:16,878 --> 06:44:18,320
honestly think that the better approach

7890
06:44:18,320 --> 06:44:19,840
is probably to combine symbolic

7891
06:44:19,840 --> 06:44:22,320
execution and fuzzing and have static

7892
06:44:22,320 --> 06:44:24,478
analysis hint about where you should go

7893
06:44:24,478 --> 06:44:26,400
so those kind of combined arms approach

7894
06:44:26,400 --> 06:44:27,760
are where we're where we're directing

7895
06:44:27,760 --> 06:44:30,958
our effort instead of performance

7896
06:44:32,160 --> 06:44:33,440
anybody else want to yell at me about

7897
06:44:33,440 --> 06:44:35,680
blockchain software

7898
06:44:35,680 --> 06:44:37,680
all right i'm sorry for corrupting your

7899
06:44:37,680 --> 06:44:40,270
brilliant event with blockchain [ __ ]

7900
06:44:40,270 --> 06:44:42,478
[Laughter]

7901
06:44:42,478 --> 06:44:44,080
but uh meet me at the bar if you want to

7902
06:44:44,080 --> 06:44:46,718
complain about it

7903
06:44:47,760 --> 06:44:51,239
thank you very much

7904
06:44:53,040 --> 06:44:56,320
uh by some miracle of scheduling we are

7905
06:44:56,320 --> 06:44:58,638
uh ahead of schedule

7906
06:44:58,638 --> 06:45:00,478
i don't i i don't even think our next

7907
06:45:00,478 --> 06:45:02,638
speaker is ready yet uh we have 12

7908
06:45:02,638 --> 06:45:04,478
minutes so um how many beers do you

7909
06:45:04,478 --> 06:45:07,200
think you can have in 12 minutes

7910
06:45:07,200 --> 06:45:09,440
12 beers in 12 minutes

7911
06:45:09,440 --> 06:45:11,600
okay

7912
06:45:11,600 --> 06:45:14,400
yes if you can do it i will buy your 12

7913
06:45:14,400 --> 06:45:16,638
beers

7914
06:45:16,638 --> 06:45:18,718
12 beers in 12 minutes and if you can't

7915
06:45:18,718 --> 06:45:22,320
do it then um

7916
06:45:22,320 --> 06:45:24,000
i guess you're just gonna

7917
06:45:24,000 --> 06:45:25,840
die i don't know what happens at that

7918
06:45:25,840 --> 06:45:28,080
point yeah yeah it's 12 years or 12

7919
06:45:28,080 --> 06:45:31,200
minutes sounds horrifying um let's uh

7920
06:45:31,200 --> 06:45:34,080
let's meet in in back here in 10 minutes

7921
06:45:34,080 --> 06:45:35,920
and we'll we'll figure out just where

7922
06:45:35,920 --> 06:45:38,240
juan is to talk about cyber war

7923
06:45:38,240 --> 06:45:40,400
cyber cyber cyber cyber cyber and more

7924
06:45:40,400 --> 06:45:44,520
cyber thank you

presentations with jags here who's going

7962
06:56:16,798 --> 06:56:20,080
to talk about a wide range of

7963
06:56:20,080 --> 06:56:21,280
um

7964
06:56:21,280 --> 06:56:23,680
topics that include cyber

7965
06:56:23,680 --> 06:56:27,280
in their names let's give a uh a round

7966

7973
06:56:45,560 --> 06:56:48,650
[Music]

7974
06:56:49,440 --> 06:56:52,160
all right uh hello everybody

7975
06:56:52,160 --> 06:56:54,400
welcome to the last talk of summer con

7976
06:56:54,400 --> 06:56:57,520
people in the back buy drinks come here

7977
06:56:57,520 --> 06:56:58,878
come hang out

7978
06:56:58,878 --> 06:57:01,120
um i just found out this is internet

7979
06:57:01,120 --> 06:57:02,798
stream so i'm definitely getting in

7980
06:57:02,798 --> 06:57:04,558
trouble today so the least you could do

7981
06:57:04,558 --> 06:57:06,400
is come join me

7982
06:57:06,400 --> 06:57:08,320
all right so um

7983
06:57:08,320 --> 06:57:10,320
the title of the talk is cyber power

7984
06:57:10,320 --> 06:57:13,040
cyber war and other hallucinations and

7985
06:57:13,040 --> 06:57:15,440
this is where i i start right off the

7986
06:57:15,440 --> 06:57:18,240
bat by getting into trouble i don't mean

7987
06:57:18,240 --> 06:57:20,160
to insult a lot of other people in the

7988
06:57:20,160 --> 06:57:21,920
process of this but

7989
06:57:21,920 --> 06:57:23,520
i've been kind of conceptually

7990
06:57:23,520 --> 06:57:25,040
short-circuiting for a bit with all the

7991
06:57:25,040 --> 06:57:26,958
stuff happening in ukraine and so on so

7992
06:57:26,958 --> 06:57:28,400
we might as well

7993
06:57:28,400 --> 06:57:32,320
have a discussion about it so my name is

7994
06:57:32,320 --> 06:57:33,840
everybody calls me jags because nobody

7995
06:57:33,840 --> 06:57:35,520
can pronounce that

7996
06:57:35,520 --> 06:57:37,680
sentinel one is kind enough to let me

7997
06:57:37,680 --> 06:57:39,760
come and do this sort of thing so all

7998
06:57:39,760 --> 06:57:41,440
power to them

7999
06:57:41,440 --> 06:57:44,160
um so somebody in the crowd actually

8000
06:57:44,160 --> 06:57:46,400
suggested that this talk should be

8001
06:57:46,400 --> 06:57:49,040
essentially one giant subtweet

8002
06:57:49,040 --> 06:57:50,718
and it almost feels inevitable that it's

8003
06:57:50,718 --> 06:57:52,080
gonna be that

8004
06:57:52,080 --> 06:57:54,400
um

8005
06:57:55,440 --> 06:57:57,120
so i want to talk about our collective

8006
06:57:57,120 --> 06:57:58,798
hallucinations or if you want to call

8007
06:57:58,798 --> 06:58:00,638
them delusions or ghosts but in reality

8008
06:58:00,638 --> 06:58:03,280
what i mean are conceptual fallacies

8009
06:58:03,280 --> 06:58:05,520
so maybe that just goes to show that i

8010
06:58:05,520 --> 06:58:07,440
was actually a philosophy major and i

8011
06:58:07,440 --> 06:58:10,240
you know probably there you go thank you

8012
06:58:10,240 --> 06:58:11,360
um

8013
06:58:11,360 --> 06:58:13,040
and that i'm just sort of uncomfortable

8014
06:58:13,040 --> 06:58:15,040
with the idea of what i think of like as

8015
06:58:15,040 --> 06:58:17,520
conceptual nots which is the notion that

8016
06:58:17,520 --> 06:58:19,760
we're arguing about a lot of

8017
06:58:19,760 --> 06:58:22,878
concepts that don't actually make any

8018
06:58:22,878 --> 06:58:25,440
sense like they they're logically

8019
06:58:25,440 --> 06:58:27,600
fallacious and you know inherently

8020
06:58:27,600 --> 06:58:29,680
irrational and the concepts that i want

8021
06:58:29,680 --> 06:58:31,280
to focus on in particular are cyber

8022
06:58:31,280 --> 06:58:33,760
power and cyber war and i'm look i know

8023
06:58:33,760 --> 06:58:36,080
i'm throwing the cyber word around a lot

8024
06:58:36,080 --> 06:58:38,320
i'm not any happier with it than any of

8025
06:58:38,320 --> 06:58:40,240
you are i'm actually deeply

8026
06:58:40,240 --> 06:58:41,920
uncomfortable with this [ __ ] so that's

8027
06:58:41,920 --> 06:58:44,080
why i want to talk about it

8028
06:58:44,080 --> 06:58:44,878
so

8029
06:58:44,878 --> 06:58:46,798
why cyberpower how many of you have

8030
06:58:46,798 --> 06:58:49,520
heard this word in the past two years

8031
06:58:49,520 --> 06:58:51,760
all right i'm sorry um

8032
06:58:51,760 --> 06:58:52,400
so

8033
06:58:52,400 --> 06:58:53,760
the reason i'm talking about salary

8034
06:58:53,760 --> 06:58:55,760
power is because of [ __ ] like this

8035
06:58:55,760 --> 06:58:57,600
uh if anybody wrote this report in the

8036
06:58:57,600 --> 06:58:59,280
crowd i'm so sorry

8037
06:58:59,280 --> 06:59:01,280
but essentially if you can't see it from

8038
06:59:01,280 --> 06:59:03,120
afar this is a

8039
06:59:03,120 --> 06:59:04,878
an index of

8040
06:59:04,878 --> 06:59:08,638
the world's top cyber powers

8041
06:59:08,638 --> 06:59:12,638
um ranked somehow by power score

8042
06:59:12,638 --> 06:59:15,120
um and of course you know the u.s is at

8043
06:59:15,120 --> 06:59:17,600
the very top china uk but you'll also

8044
06:59:17,600 --> 06:59:20,160
see some oddities like japan you know

8045
06:59:20,160 --> 06:59:22,478
israel is it like number 10 it's like

8046
06:59:22,478 --> 06:59:24,478
you know sort of scratching the bottom

8047
06:59:24,478 --> 06:59:27,600
and then you have things like

8048
06:59:27,600 --> 06:59:31,920
lithuania anyways um obviously a bit of

8049
06:59:31,920 --> 06:59:32,840
a

8050
06:59:32,840 --> 06:59:35,360
stretch why it actually matters that

8051
06:59:35,360 --> 06:59:37,120
somebody built this stupid graph is that

8052
06:59:37,120 --> 06:59:39,840
it came as part of a much larger report

8053
06:59:39,840 --> 06:59:42,638
from an incredibly reputable university

8054
06:59:42,638 --> 06:59:44,798
with people that i actually like as

8055
06:59:44,798 --> 06:59:47,200
human beings but i can't get behind this

8056
06:59:47,200 --> 06:59:49,360
project at all

8057
06:59:49,360 --> 06:59:51,120
because i think that it's fundamentally

8058
06:59:51,120 --> 06:59:54,638
flawed the methodology they used was

8059
06:59:54,638 --> 06:59:56,160
i was looking for a different word other

8060
06:59:56,160 --> 07:00:00,400
than like idiotic so i say obtuse

8061
07:00:00,400 --> 07:00:02,638
you're ranking cyber capability by

8062
07:00:02,638 --> 07:00:05,360
countries essentially on how they

8063
07:00:05,360 --> 07:00:09,840
describe their own capabilities

8064
07:00:10,638 --> 07:00:12,000
that's the kind of thinking that got the

8065
07:00:12,000 --> 07:00:14,400
russians into ukraine um

8066
07:00:14,400 --> 07:00:15,280
so

8067
07:00:15,280 --> 07:00:17,360
cyber power measured by self-reporting

8068
07:00:17,360 --> 07:00:19,760
essentially so everybody is in this sort

8069
07:00:19,760 --> 07:00:24,160
of over 9000 range of cyber power um and

8070
07:00:24,160 --> 07:00:27,040
it really makes you wonder how

8071
07:00:27,040 --> 07:00:29,280
good an idea it is to

8072
07:00:29,280 --> 07:00:32,160
look to see how boisterous a nation is

8073
07:00:32,160 --> 07:00:34,160
about their covert

8074
07:00:34,160 --> 07:00:35,920
um and that's how we got this concept

8075
07:00:35,920 --> 07:00:37,120
right like we like we don't have enough

8076
07:00:37,120 --> 07:00:39,360
data regarding past or current

8077
07:00:39,360 --> 07:00:40,958
operations nor their existing

8078
07:00:40,958 --> 07:00:42,638
capabilities nor their capability

8079
07:00:42,638 --> 07:00:45,040
production pipeline no norther covert

8080
07:00:45,040 --> 07:00:46,080
intent

8081
07:00:46,080 --> 07:00:47,360
so

8082
07:00:47,360 --> 07:00:49,440
let's just take them at their word

8083
07:00:49,440 --> 07:00:51,280
um

8084
07:00:51,280 --> 07:00:53,200
it's a big what the [ __ ] moment

8085
07:00:53,200 --> 07:00:54,080
but

8086
07:00:54,080 --> 07:00:56,240
again if i'm talking about these things

8087
07:00:56,240 --> 07:00:58,478
it's not because someone in some tiny

8088
07:00:58,478 --> 07:01:00,400
corner somewhere made a stupid mistake

8089
07:01:00,400 --> 07:01:02,000
and i'm beating them for it it's because

8090
07:01:02,000 --> 07:01:03,760
these are like

8091
07:01:03,760 --> 07:01:05,840
harvard pushed this thing and

8092
07:01:05,840 --> 07:01:07,440
everybody's been talking about it for

8093
07:01:07,440 --> 07:01:09,520
two years and i wish it were the only

8094
07:01:09,520 --> 07:01:11,280
mistaken thing that everyone's talking

8095
07:01:11,280 --> 07:01:12,718
about but it's not

8096
07:01:12,718 --> 07:01:16,558
so awful lot of muddled thinking

8097
07:01:17,040 --> 07:01:18,958
so again the point isn't to pick on a

8098
07:01:18,958 --> 07:01:20,558
bad paper

8099
07:01:20,558 --> 07:01:22,558
instead what i want to talk about is how

8100
07:01:22,558 --> 07:01:24,638
logically fallacious the whole thing is

8101
07:01:24,638 --> 07:01:26,160
and i think the only way that we can

8102
07:01:26,160 --> 07:01:28,400
really reach that perhaps because of my

8103
07:01:28,400 --> 07:01:31,360
training my my horrible unemployable

8104
07:01:31,360 --> 07:01:34,000
background as a philosophy major is to

8105
07:01:34,000 --> 07:01:36,718
just kind of poke at the idea in a bunch

8106
07:01:36,718 --> 07:01:38,638
of sort of other scenarios and see if it

8107
07:01:38,638 --> 07:01:40,718
really stands up to muster

8108
07:01:40,718 --> 07:01:43,280
so what does it mean to measure cyber

8109
07:01:43,280 --> 07:01:45,280
power

8110
07:01:45,280 --> 07:01:47,360
what does it mean to describe it

8111
07:01:47,360 --> 07:01:49,600
absolutely right if i say

8112
07:01:49,600 --> 07:01:51,760
that you know the united states is a

8113
07:01:51,760 --> 07:01:54,558
hundred and england is a 75

8114
07:01:54,558 --> 07:01:56,160
you're saying that their cyber power is

8115
07:01:56,160 --> 07:01:58,080
absolute it's the same no matter what

8116
07:01:58,080 --> 07:01:59,360
they're doing

8117
07:01:59,360 --> 07:02:00,638
so

8118
07:02:00,638 --> 07:02:02,878
i don't think that that stands up to any

8119
07:02:02,878 --> 07:02:05,280
reasoning whatsoever how is cyber power

8120
07:02:05,280 --> 07:02:08,320
not essentially contingent or relative

8121
07:02:08,320 --> 07:02:10,798
right so let's think about it nation a

8122
07:02:10,798 --> 07:02:12,558
sits on a stockpile

8123
07:02:12,558 --> 07:02:15,200
of like cutting-edge windows

8124
07:02:15,200 --> 07:02:17,520
infection vectors zero-day exploits

8125
07:02:17,520 --> 07:02:19,600
toolkits and operational talent right

8126
07:02:19,600 --> 07:02:21,520
like they're just looking great in this

8127
07:02:21,520 --> 07:02:23,360
area

8128
07:02:23,360 --> 07:02:25,840
what is nation a cyber power

8129
07:02:25,840 --> 07:02:26,718
um

8130
07:02:26,718 --> 07:02:28,478
well i think inevitably you'd have to

8131
07:02:28,478 --> 07:02:30,240
ask the question well who is nation a

8132
07:02:30,240 --> 07:02:32,320
attacking

8133
07:02:32,320 --> 07:02:34,080
so let's put that

8134
07:02:34,080 --> 07:02:36,320
nation a has this stockpile of whatever

8135
07:02:36,320 --> 07:02:38,160
uh windows infection vectors exploits

8136
07:02:38,160 --> 07:02:40,080
toolkits and talent and they're trying

8137
07:02:40,080 --> 07:02:42,718
to attack nation b which relies solely

8138
07:02:42,718 --> 07:02:45,040
on linux systems

8139
07:02:45,040 --> 07:02:46,160
what is

8140
07:02:46,160 --> 07:02:49,280
nation a's relative cyber power is it

8141
07:02:49,280 --> 07:02:51,920
zero i mean are they just

8142
07:02:51,920 --> 07:02:53,600
powerless in this area well what if

8143
07:02:53,600 --> 07:02:56,000
nation a has unparalleled capability

8144
07:02:56,000 --> 07:02:57,680
like in a production pipeline that

8145
07:02:57,680 --> 07:02:59,360
allows it to be swift and adaptable

8146
07:02:59,360 --> 07:03:00,798
right they've never done linux but they

8147
07:03:00,798 --> 07:03:02,558
can figure out linux in three days and

8148
07:03:02,558 --> 07:03:05,040
they'll be good to go so are they back

8149
07:03:05,040 --> 07:03:07,760
to a hundred and relative cyber power

8150
07:03:07,760 --> 07:03:08,798
um

8151
07:03:08,798 --> 07:03:10,478
what if nation b doesn't rely on its

8152
07:03:10,478 --> 07:03:12,558
systems for anything important which is

8153
07:03:12,558 --> 07:03:13,760
something that we have to keep thinking

8154
07:03:13,760 --> 07:03:14,958
about when people start talking about

8155
07:03:14,958 --> 07:03:17,280
well can't we just hack

8156
07:03:17,280 --> 07:03:19,760
the russian nuke stockpile it's like

8157
07:03:19,760 --> 07:03:22,080
well it's a bunch of analog systems from

8158
07:03:22,080 --> 07:03:23,840
the 1970s

8159
07:03:23,840 --> 07:03:26,320
good luck

8160
07:03:26,400 --> 07:03:28,080
so what's nation aids relative cyber

8161
07:03:28,080 --> 07:03:30,320
power now is it 20

8162
07:03:30,320 --> 07:03:32,478
how do we objection objectively measure

8163
07:03:32,478 --> 07:03:33,920
intent

8164
07:03:33,920 --> 07:03:35,920
and look i know that i'm beating a straw

8165
07:03:35,920 --> 07:03:37,440
man here but like

8166
07:03:37,440 --> 07:03:39,440
none of this is in that 120 page paper

8167
07:03:39,440 --> 07:03:40,638
and it certainly doesn't make it to the

8168
07:03:40,638 --> 07:03:42,240
new york times so let's let's follow

8169
07:03:42,240 --> 07:03:44,958
along right so let's say nation c

8170
07:03:44,958 --> 07:03:48,478
is an over 9 000 cyber power i mean

8171
07:03:48,478 --> 07:03:49,600
there you go

8172
07:03:49,600 --> 07:03:50,478
um

8173
07:03:50,478 --> 07:03:52,718
nation a is a vulnerable nation it's a

8174
07:03:52,718 --> 07:03:54,638
prime target for effects based

8175
07:03:54,638 --> 07:03:56,240
operations right you could take down

8176
07:03:56,240 --> 07:03:57,520
their power

8177
07:03:57,520 --> 07:03:59,360
you can blow up their steel

8178
07:03:59,360 --> 07:04:01,040
manufacturing

8179
07:04:01,040 --> 07:04:04,080
you know whatever

8180
07:04:04,240 --> 07:04:06,400
what does it mean when nation c is a

8181
07:04:06,400 --> 07:04:08,798
law-abiding country with extensive

8182
07:04:08,798 --> 07:04:10,718
oversight legal frameworks and

8183
07:04:10,718 --> 07:04:12,798
constraints the sort brought to you by

8184
07:04:12,798 --> 07:04:15,200
the law offices of ford meat in maryland

8185
07:04:15,200 --> 07:04:17,360
right

8186
07:04:17,360 --> 07:04:19,760
and nation a is

8187
07:04:19,760 --> 07:04:21,360
the essen essentially the legal

8188
07:04:21,360 --> 07:04:24,638
equivalent of idgaf right

8189
07:04:24,638 --> 07:04:27,040
i think u.s versus iran

8190
07:04:27,040 --> 07:04:29,360
u.s versus north korea

8191
07:04:29,360 --> 07:04:32,478
vietnam whatever

8192
07:04:32,718 --> 07:04:36,080
what is the relative cyber power of

8193
07:04:36,080 --> 07:04:39,680
these two decision trees

8194
07:04:39,680 --> 07:04:41,200
and i bring that up in particular

8195
07:04:41,200 --> 07:04:43,120
because

8196
07:04:43,120 --> 07:04:45,040
the us is at the very top of that

8197
07:04:45,040 --> 07:04:46,718
listing right the united states is the

8198
07:04:46,718 --> 07:04:48,798
greatest cyber power on earth i think

8199
07:04:48,798 --> 07:04:50,160
that a lot of us would have a hard time

8200
07:04:50,160 --> 07:04:52,478
arguing against that however

8201
07:04:52,478 --> 07:04:54,718
what does it mean when it's like this

8202
07:04:54,718 --> 07:04:57,680
roided out sitting duck that can't move

8203
07:04:57,680 --> 07:04:59,760
a finger because a thousand lawyers are

8204
07:04:59,760 --> 07:05:01,680
gonna jump on your back while the north

8205
07:05:01,680 --> 07:05:03,920
koreans are like wiping everything and

8206
07:05:03,920 --> 07:05:05,760
just like defacing your websites and

8207
07:05:05,760 --> 07:05:07,840
stealing your crypto and you know

8208
07:05:07,840 --> 07:05:09,680
heisting your banks

8209
07:05:09,680 --> 07:05:12,080
who is the greater relative cyber power

8210
07:05:12,080 --> 07:05:14,080
at that point

8211
07:05:14,080 --> 07:05:15,600
and you know i'm gonna throw a couple of

8212
07:05:15,600 --> 07:05:17,120
other wrenches like what about countries

8213
07:05:17,120 --> 07:05:19,200
that buy their capabilities a lot of

8214
07:05:19,200 --> 07:05:20,320
them have been doing that we've been

8215
07:05:20,320 --> 07:05:22,080
talking about nso but let's not forget

8216
07:05:22,080 --> 07:05:23,520
about hacking team yet let's not forget

8217
07:05:23,520 --> 07:05:25,200
about finn fisher and all the things

8218
07:05:25,200 --> 07:05:26,478
that we learned along the way and all

8219
07:05:26,478 --> 07:05:28,478
sort of like the local providers

8220
07:05:28,478 --> 07:05:29,680
um

8221
07:05:29,680 --> 07:05:31,520
and what about countries that upcycle

8222
07:05:31,520 --> 07:05:33,200
their capabilities and this is the part

8223
07:05:33,200 --> 07:05:35,040
that like really bums me out this is

8224
07:05:35,040 --> 07:05:37,360
like the equivalent of i don't know

8225
07:05:37,360 --> 07:05:39,520
composting in the cyber world

8226
07:05:39,520 --> 07:05:41,680
but you look at something like latin

8227
07:05:41,680 --> 07:05:44,000
american nation state operations relying

8228
07:05:44,000 --> 07:05:46,478
on things like adwind and njrat or the

8229
07:05:46,478 --> 07:05:49,120
middle east with banduk or india with

8230
07:05:49,120 --> 07:05:51,520
netwire and dark comet or former soviet

8231
07:05:51,520 --> 07:05:53,360
republics that use everything from like

8232
07:05:53,360 --> 07:05:56,638
jrat to stalkerware and the cost of

8233
07:05:56,638 --> 07:05:59,440
operations is anywhere from free to 50

8234
07:05:59,440 --> 07:06:01,280
bucks

8235
07:06:01,280 --> 07:06:05,200
it works oh god

8236
07:06:05,200 --> 07:06:07,760
where's yours

8237
07:06:07,760 --> 07:06:11,000
you see

8238
07:06:20,558 --> 07:06:21,760
ever

8239
07:06:21,760 --> 07:06:23,840
this is how i end up getting kicked out

8240
07:06:23,840 --> 07:06:25,360
of summercock

8241
07:06:25,360 --> 07:06:26,958
again

8242
07:06:26,958 --> 07:06:29,760
all right oh god

8243
07:06:29,760 --> 07:06:33,717
so what about cyber war

8244
07:06:34,080 --> 07:06:35,760
this is essentially like the favorite

8245
07:06:35,760 --> 07:06:37,200
material for academic mental

8246
07:06:37,200 --> 07:06:38,718
masturbation and i'm sure that all of

8247
07:06:38,718 --> 07:06:39,840
you with what's been happening in

8248
07:06:39,840 --> 07:06:42,080
ukraine what's happening in

8249
07:06:42,080 --> 07:06:44,958
iran thank you um

8250
07:06:44,958 --> 07:06:46,478
have have more than heard this term

8251
07:06:46,478 --> 07:06:48,240
recently

8252
07:06:48,240 --> 07:06:50,638
where it gets dizzying is

8253
07:06:50,638 --> 07:06:52,000
did it happen

8254
07:06:52,000 --> 07:06:53,520
did it not happen

8255
07:06:53,520 --> 07:06:54,878
will it happen

8256
07:06:54,878 --> 07:06:56,320
why would it happen

8257
07:06:56,320 --> 07:06:57,920
why didn't it happen

8258
07:06:57,920 --> 07:07:00,400
the cyber war happen when we cross a

8259
07:07:00,400 --> 07:07:02,160
particular line in the sand you know

8260
07:07:02,160 --> 07:07:04,160
does rob lee from dragos just draw it

8261
07:07:04,160 --> 07:07:05,760
with his own little finger and you can't

8262
07:07:05,760 --> 07:07:07,280
step beyond that

8263
07:07:07,280 --> 07:07:10,240
or is it cumulative right like once you

8264
07:07:10,240 --> 07:07:12,080
stack all these things together we've

8265
07:07:12,080 --> 07:07:13,440
gone from like

8266
07:07:13,440 --> 07:07:18,000
normal operations to full on cyber war

8267
07:07:18,000 --> 07:07:19,600
and like if you think i'm kidding about

8268
07:07:19,600 --> 07:07:21,840
this like do please take a quick

8269
07:07:21,840 --> 07:07:23,680
snapshot at

8270
07:07:23,680 --> 07:07:26,478
this op-ed that story

8271
07:07:26,478 --> 07:07:29,360
the next one the one after that

8272
07:07:29,360 --> 07:07:31,360
did it you know is it behind the scenes

8273
07:07:31,360 --> 07:07:33,520
have we not seen it is it beginning to

8274
07:07:33,520 --> 07:07:36,080
escalate is it moving backwards is it

8275
07:07:36,080 --> 07:07:37,680
you know is it actually the ukrainians

8276
07:07:37,680 --> 07:07:40,958
hacking the russians um

8277
07:07:40,958 --> 07:07:43,120
it didn't yet come it may come it did

8278
07:07:43,120 --> 07:07:46,160
not come it could um

8279
07:07:46,160 --> 07:07:48,000
anyways this is a

8280
07:07:48,000 --> 07:07:50,240
you know even that the bella russians

8281
07:07:50,240 --> 07:07:51,920
are the ones fighting the cyber war now

8282
07:07:51,920 --> 07:07:53,360
actually they're

8283
07:07:53,360 --> 07:07:55,280
doing pretty interesting things so the

8284
07:07:55,280 --> 07:07:56,638
reason that i'm bringing all this stuff

8285
07:07:56,638 --> 07:07:58,798
up is actually we are being

8286
07:07:58,798 --> 07:08:00,478
fed this kind of

8287
07:08:00,478 --> 07:08:02,240
consistent

8288
07:08:02,240 --> 07:08:05,680
nonsense about cyber war and i know that

8289
07:08:05,680 --> 07:08:07,680
everybody in this room is

8290
07:08:07,680 --> 07:08:11,040
bright enough to see right through it

8291
07:08:11,040 --> 07:08:12,558
but

8292
07:08:12,558 --> 07:08:14,638
a two and a half hour train ride from

8293
07:08:14,638 --> 07:08:16,878
here is dc where no one can see right

8294
07:08:16,878 --> 07:08:19,200
through this [ __ ] except perry and it's

8295
07:08:19,200 --> 07:08:20,718
like

8296
07:08:20,718 --> 07:08:22,718
it's actually troubling to what extent

8297
07:08:22,718 --> 07:08:24,718
each one of these op-eds like lands with

8298
07:08:24,718 --> 07:08:26,798
these folks and actually influences

8299
07:08:26,798 --> 07:08:28,240
decision makers and influences

8300
07:08:28,240 --> 07:08:30,718
conversations and um

8301
07:08:30,718 --> 07:08:33,040
and so on so

8302
07:08:33,040 --> 07:08:35,120
i'm just going to keep going with this

8303
07:08:35,120 --> 07:08:37,360
all right i'm done

8304
07:08:37,360 --> 07:08:38,798
actually i'm not done there's a couple

8305
07:08:38,798 --> 07:08:40,478
more like you see this

8306
07:08:40,478 --> 07:08:42,638
fog of cyber war russian cyber war

8307
07:08:42,638 --> 07:08:44,558
ukraine was a fantasy

8308
07:08:44,558 --> 07:08:46,638
please note that it was written on march

8309
07:08:46,638 --> 07:08:47,920
8th

8310
07:08:47,920 --> 07:08:50,798
the the invasion of ukraine started on

8311
07:08:50,798 --> 07:08:53,360
february 28th just keep that in mind we

8312
07:08:53,360 --> 07:08:55,280
can't we cannot wait to write these

8313
07:08:55,280 --> 07:08:56,320
op-eds

8314
07:08:56,320 --> 07:08:57,440
um

8315
07:08:57,440 --> 07:09:00,080
keeps going uh this one's my favorite

8316
07:09:00,080 --> 07:09:01,680
putin's invasion of ukraine didn't rely

8317
07:09:01,680 --> 07:09:04,718
on cyber war and here's why

8318
07:09:04,718 --> 07:09:08,558
also written march 7th

8319
07:09:08,718 --> 07:09:10,798
the last one is actually my favorite

8320
07:09:10,798 --> 07:09:12,400
because

8321
07:09:12,400 --> 07:09:15,200
this is our tracking of operations in

8322
07:09:15,200 --> 07:09:16,878
ukraine up to

8323
07:09:16,878 --> 07:09:19,520
june 2022

8324
07:09:19,520 --> 07:09:20,798
and it's already outdated it was

8325
07:09:20,798 --> 07:09:22,478
outdated halfway through june but if you

8326
07:09:22,478 --> 07:09:24,080
look at this

8327
07:09:24,080 --> 07:09:26,160
i know that most folks don't appreciate

8328
07:09:26,160 --> 07:09:29,120
all the fancy names but

8329
07:09:29,120 --> 07:09:31,360
you have your turla your sandworm a

8330
07:09:31,360 --> 07:09:33,440
couple of unattributed groups you have

8331
07:09:33,440 --> 07:09:36,638
the chinese you have the bellow russians

8332
07:09:36,638 --> 07:09:38,558
um and everyone and their mother sort of

8333
07:09:38,558 --> 07:09:40,320
doing collection but more importantly

8334
07:09:40,320 --> 07:09:42,878
doing a lot of effects based operations

8335
07:09:42,878 --> 07:09:44,558
and let's be clear i'm not coming here

8336
07:09:44,558 --> 07:09:46,478
to make the argument that espionage is

8337
07:09:46,478 --> 07:09:48,798
somehow cyber war that is not the point

8338
07:09:48,798 --> 07:09:50,320
i'm trying to make the exact opposite

8339
07:09:50,320 --> 07:09:52,000
point but

8340
07:09:52,000 --> 07:09:54,080
if there has ever been a situation where

8341
07:09:54,080 --> 07:09:56,558
we could describe any potential cyber

8342
07:09:56,558 --> 07:09:59,600
warfare ukraine would be it

8343
07:09:59,600 --> 07:10:01,760
and the fact that we can't even sort of

8344
07:10:01,760 --> 07:10:03,600
get our head out out of our asses about

8345
07:10:03,600 --> 07:10:05,280
this one means that we're in trouble

8346
07:10:05,280 --> 07:10:07,520
conceptually also from microsoft a

8347
07:10:07,520 --> 07:10:10,160
fantastic rundown uh this is stolen from

8348
07:10:10,160 --> 07:10:12,320
microsoft's well the report that mystic

8349
07:10:12,320 --> 07:10:14,478
actually wrote

8350
07:10:14,478 --> 07:10:16,478
including a week by week breakdown of

8351
07:10:16,478 --> 07:10:18,240
how these wipers were used how data has

8352
07:10:18,240 --> 07:10:20,320
been destroyed etc

8353
07:10:20,320 --> 07:10:21,120
now

8354
07:10:21,120 --> 07:10:22,958
where it actually matters is things like

8355
07:10:22,958 --> 07:10:24,080
this

8356
07:10:24,080 --> 07:10:26,638
russia sand worm hackers attempted a

8357
07:10:26,638 --> 07:10:30,399
third blackout in ukraine

8358
07:10:30,558 --> 07:10:32,400
that's right

8359
07:10:32,400 --> 07:10:34,000
whoever's popping champagne that was the

8360
07:10:34,000 --> 07:10:37,120
right moment um there you go

8361
07:10:37,120 --> 07:10:38,718
now i want to point to this because i

8362
07:10:38,718 --> 07:10:39,920
think the map doesn't really do it

8363
07:10:39,920 --> 07:10:41,440
justice but if you look at it right we

8364
07:10:41,440 --> 07:10:44,000
have power blackout cyber enabled power

8365
07:10:44,000 --> 07:10:46,000
blackout number one

8366
07:10:46,000 --> 07:10:48,080
power blackout number two actually using

8367
07:10:48,080 --> 07:10:49,680
custom ics tooling you have the

8368
07:10:49,680 --> 07:10:52,320
costliest cyber attack of all time

8369
07:10:52,320 --> 07:10:54,478
which i regrettably named not petya i'm

8370
07:10:54,478 --> 07:10:57,120
very sorry about that you have fake

8371
07:10:57,120 --> 07:10:58,400
state-sponsored ransomware and

8372
07:10:58,400 --> 07:11:01,200
government defacements you have 12

8373
07:11:01,200 --> 07:11:03,760
wipers so far

8374
07:11:03,760 --> 07:11:05,680
probably more this is what we found so

8375
07:11:05,680 --> 07:11:06,958
far

8376
07:11:06,958 --> 07:11:08,400
then you have an attempt to degrade or

8377
07:11:08,400 --> 07:11:10,400
deny military satellite communications

8378
07:11:10,400 --> 07:11:12,320
with a wiper that we called acid rain at

8379
07:11:12,320 --> 07:11:14,400
the beginning of the invasion uh you

8380
07:11:14,400 --> 07:11:16,240
have attacks on telcos

8381
07:11:16,240 --> 07:11:19,120
you have an attempt at a third power

8382
07:11:19,120 --> 07:11:20,400
blackout

8383
07:11:20,400 --> 07:11:23,360
um and of course tons of espionage so

8384
07:11:23,360 --> 07:11:25,200
you're telling me that like

8385
07:11:25,200 --> 07:11:26,840
none of these things

8386
07:11:26,840 --> 07:11:29,600
cumulatively mount up the cyber war and

8387
07:11:29,600 --> 07:11:32,718
none of them individually

8388
07:11:32,718 --> 07:11:35,600
mount out the cyber war so my point here

8389
07:11:35,600 --> 07:11:37,280
is really

8390
07:11:37,280 --> 07:11:38,320
that

8391
07:11:38,320 --> 07:11:40,240
maybe the problem is the concept of

8392
07:11:40,240 --> 07:11:43,840
cyber war itself

8393
07:11:44,718 --> 07:11:46,558
i got scared i saw fear walking up to

8394
07:11:46,558 --> 07:11:49,840
the stage i'm freaked out

8395
07:11:50,878 --> 07:11:54,160
they don't have fireballs so it's okay

8396
07:11:54,160 --> 07:11:55,200
so

8397
07:11:55,200 --> 07:11:56,718
after all i think what i really want to

8398
07:11:56,718 --> 07:11:58,320
point out is like we don't talk about

8399
07:11:58,320 --> 07:12:00,718
21st century war taking place in any

8400
07:12:00,718 --> 07:12:02,878
single domain right like the cyber

8401
07:12:02,878 --> 07:12:04,320
domain is the you know we talk about it

8402
07:12:04,320 --> 07:12:05,760
as the fifth domain the israelis talk

8403
07:12:05,760 --> 07:12:07,120
about as the fourth domain anybody who

8404
07:12:07,120 --> 07:12:09,040
hasn't been into space uh thinks of it

8405
07:12:09,040 --> 07:12:11,840
as the fourth

8406
07:12:13,120 --> 07:12:14,638
this is being streamed online so i'm

8407
07:12:14,638 --> 07:12:18,239
just going to keep my comments to myself

8408
07:12:19,920 --> 07:12:21,680
so

8409
07:12:21,680 --> 07:12:23,680
i would also point out that we don't

8410
07:12:23,680 --> 07:12:24,400
really

8411
07:12:24,400 --> 07:12:26,000
speak your mind you're gonna have to

8412
07:12:26,000 --> 07:12:29,680
hold me up if i do again um so i think

8413
07:12:29,680 --> 07:12:31,680
the point being even in 21st century

8414
07:12:31,680 --> 07:12:33,600
declared wars aren't really a thing ask

8415
07:12:33,600 --> 07:12:34,878
the russians whether they're at war with

8416
07:12:34,878 --> 07:12:36,400
ukraine they'll give you some [ __ ]

8417
07:12:36,400 --> 07:12:38,240
about denotifying we've had plenty of

8418
07:12:38,240 --> 07:12:39,920
proxy wars happening in the past 20

8419
07:12:39,920 --> 07:12:40,878
years

8420
07:12:40,878 --> 07:12:42,878
um i think our concepts are outdated and

8421
07:12:42,878 --> 07:12:44,160
that's really the point of the whole

8422
07:12:44,160 --> 07:12:45,760
conversation right our concepts are

8423
07:12:45,760 --> 07:12:48,080
outdated in many significant ways but

8424
07:12:48,080 --> 07:12:50,478
why is cyber different why is it

8425
07:12:50,478 --> 07:12:53,440
different than the other ones right like

8426
07:12:53,440 --> 07:12:54,958
it's supposed to be a war fighting

8427
07:12:54,958 --> 07:12:56,638
domain that's how we keep talking about

8428
07:12:56,638 --> 07:12:58,718
it that's how perry's friends talk about

8429
07:12:58,718 --> 07:13:01,760
it but it's not really that

8430
07:13:01,760 --> 07:13:04,558
um it's arguably the first major

8431
07:13:04,558 --> 07:13:06,958
military innovation or mmi to actually

8432
07:13:06,958 --> 07:13:08,718
come from the intelligence community

8433
07:13:08,718 --> 07:13:11,360
instead of the military i say arguably

8434
07:13:11,360 --> 07:13:13,200
because some nerds in the crowd might

8435
07:13:13,200 --> 07:13:16,320
point out that uavs also did but

8436
07:13:16,320 --> 07:13:18,840
i would give darpa credit for that

8437
07:13:18,840 --> 07:13:22,000
instead um so this is actually like the

8438
07:13:22,000 --> 07:13:23,760
bigger point that i want to make it's

8439
07:13:23,760 --> 07:13:26,718
that we don't actually know we don't

8440
07:13:26,718 --> 07:13:29,360
understand the history of how cyber has

8441
07:13:29,360 --> 07:13:31,280
become what it is

8442
07:13:31,280 --> 07:13:33,120
and we need to we should

8443
07:13:33,120 --> 07:13:34,478
so here's some good resources from

8444
07:13:34,478 --> 07:13:36,958
really smart people like max smeats and

8445
07:13:36,958 --> 07:13:38,878
danny moore they wrote great books and

8446
07:13:38,878 --> 07:13:40,638
they you know are

8447
07:13:40,638 --> 07:13:43,680
far more sober in every sense of the

8448
07:13:43,680 --> 07:13:45,920
word about their assessments on this

8449
07:13:45,920 --> 07:13:48,400
um and you should absolutely read these

8450
07:13:48,400 --> 07:13:50,080
but i think the most important resource

8451
07:13:50,080 --> 07:13:52,160
is one that's being ignored and that i

8452
07:13:52,160 --> 07:13:54,160
really want to point out to this crowd

8453
07:13:54,160 --> 07:13:57,120
and it's a phd dissertation by a guy

8454
07:13:57,120 --> 07:13:59,280
called craig weiner i'm sorry

8455
07:13:59,280 --> 07:14:02,400
unfortunately named um and it's the most

8456
07:14:02,400 --> 07:14:04,240
important resource that you have never

8457
07:14:04,240 --> 07:14:06,320
read and it's publicly available and

8458
07:14:06,320 --> 07:14:08,080
it's free and you should absolutely take

8459
07:14:08,080 --> 07:14:10,160
your time to do it and i think it's

8460
07:14:10,160 --> 07:14:12,798
really important because it's actually

8461
07:14:12,798 --> 07:14:16,080
the most comprehensive unclassified

8462
07:14:16,080 --> 07:14:18,558
history of the development of cyber in

8463
07:14:18,558 --> 07:14:21,360
the united states intelligence community

8464
07:14:21,360 --> 07:14:23,120
i would argue in one side of the u.s

8465
07:14:23,120 --> 07:14:24,320
intelligence community because there's

8466
07:14:24,320 --> 07:14:25,920
the nsa and the cia and we're not going

8467
07:14:25,920 --> 07:14:27,840
to get into that today

8468
07:14:27,840 --> 07:14:30,798
but it starts in the 1970s

8469
07:14:30,798 --> 07:14:32,400
and i really need to drill this into

8470
07:14:32,400 --> 07:14:34,638
people like we all think about cyber as

8471
07:14:34,638 --> 07:14:35,600
a new

8472
07:14:35,600 --> 07:14:37,920
modern innovation but the united states

8473
07:14:37,920 --> 07:14:39,680
has been working on this

8474
07:14:39,680 --> 07:14:42,240
conceptually from the 1970s and then a

8475
07:14:42,240 --> 07:14:44,160
different paradigm in the 1980s in a

8476
07:14:44,160 --> 07:14:46,718
different paradigm in the 1990s and if

8477
07:14:46,718 --> 07:14:48,558
anybody's followed the equation group i

8478
07:14:48,558 --> 07:14:50,000
can tell you personally that there's

8479
07:14:50,000 --> 07:14:52,958
technical evidence from the from 1996

8480
07:14:52,958 --> 07:14:55,200
about the beginning of their operations

8481
07:14:55,200 --> 07:14:56,558
there's only two teams that have been

8482
07:14:56,558 --> 07:14:58,478
working since that since back then and

8483
07:14:58,478 --> 07:15:01,760
continue to work to this day

8484
07:15:01,760 --> 07:15:02,958
and that's going to be relevant to this

8485
07:15:02,958 --> 07:15:06,557
presentation how am i on time

8486
07:15:07,600 --> 07:15:09,200
so and i think that should matter

8487
07:15:09,200 --> 07:15:10,160
because

8488
07:15:10,160 --> 07:15:12,080
we actually inherited all of that

8489
07:15:12,080 --> 07:15:14,878
military [ __ ] because of that and we

8490
07:15:14,878 --> 07:15:17,360
don't know that story when i say we i

8491
07:15:17,360 --> 07:15:19,040
mean all of us i don't care if you have

8492
07:15:19,040 --> 07:15:21,520
a clearance or not most cleared people

8493
07:15:21,520 --> 07:15:23,760
don't know where this all came from and

8494
07:15:23,760 --> 07:15:26,558
obviously unclear people have no idea

8495
07:15:26,558 --> 07:15:27,760
the

8496
07:15:27,760 --> 07:15:29,840
bureaucratic rigamarole that went into

8497
07:15:29,840 --> 07:15:31,520
creating cyber the way that it is and

8498
07:15:31,520 --> 07:15:33,280
the cyber industrial complex that we

8499
07:15:33,280 --> 07:15:35,840
have and i'm not judging it i'm saying

8500
07:15:35,840 --> 07:15:37,920
that that had to go through rungs of

8501
07:15:37,920 --> 07:15:39,680
bureaucracy that you would not believe

8502
07:15:39,680 --> 07:15:40,718
and it

8503
07:15:40,718 --> 07:15:42,878
it actually kind of [ __ ] up our space

8504
07:15:42,878 --> 07:15:45,120
in ways that you couldn't predict

8505
07:15:45,120 --> 07:15:47,760
cyber did not shape the bureaucracy of

8506
07:15:47,760 --> 07:15:49,840
the nsa and the military-industrial

8507
07:15:49,840 --> 07:15:53,520
concept like sorry construct um

8508
07:15:53,520 --> 07:15:56,958
bureaucracy shaped cyber

8509
07:15:56,958 --> 07:15:59,280
and if you doubt me on that

8510
07:15:59,280 --> 07:16:00,478
like go

8511
07:16:00,478 --> 07:16:03,360
look at the divisions between cno cne

8512
07:16:03,360 --> 07:16:05,520
cna and cnd can anybody tell me what all

8513
07:16:05,520 --> 07:16:07,520
of those are

8514
07:16:07,520 --> 07:16:09,840
go

8515
07:16:10,000 --> 07:16:11,920
operations

8516
07:16:11,920 --> 07:16:15,200
exploitation attack and defense that's

8517
07:16:15,200 --> 07:16:16,080
right

8518
07:16:16,080 --> 07:16:19,520
so this is usually how folks in the u.s

8519
07:16:19,520 --> 07:16:21,360
would separate these attacks right

8520
07:16:21,360 --> 07:16:23,440
operations exploitation attack and

8521
07:16:23,440 --> 07:16:25,040
defense and you can see how those would

8522
07:16:25,040 --> 07:16:26,638
be useful concepts right you have

8523
07:16:26,638 --> 07:16:29,120
operations in general you have

8524
07:16:29,120 --> 07:16:31,040
exploitation right we gain access that's

8525
07:16:31,040 --> 07:16:32,638
where all these dual use arguments come

8526
07:16:32,638 --> 07:16:34,320
into the picture right if i use a back

8527
07:16:34,320 --> 07:16:36,080
door and i first get access into your

8528
07:16:36,080 --> 07:16:37,200
system

8529
07:16:37,200 --> 07:16:39,760
i'm not really doing anything too bad

8530
07:16:39,760 --> 07:16:42,160
just yet but i could but i'm not i'm at

8531
07:16:42,160 --> 07:16:45,040
the first stage and then cna i'm having

8532
07:16:45,040 --> 07:16:46,958
an effect on what you're doing and then

8533
07:16:46,958 --> 07:16:49,040
cnd is an afterthought right defense is

8534
07:16:49,040 --> 07:16:51,040
more of like you know what we do to make

8535
07:16:51,040 --> 07:16:53,040
money

8536
07:16:53,040 --> 07:16:54,958
so

8537
07:16:54,958 --> 07:16:57,840
what i would argue is

8538
07:16:57,840 --> 07:16:59,040
take that

8539
07:16:59,040 --> 07:17:01,520
those concepts those letters to any

8540
07:17:01,520 --> 07:17:04,798
other advanced cyber power in the world

8541
07:17:04,798 --> 07:17:06,878
and ask them for an equivalent mapping

8542
07:17:06,878 --> 07:17:08,240
and what you're going to find is that

8543
07:17:08,240 --> 07:17:11,360
that is a very american invention

8544
07:17:11,360 --> 07:17:13,120
and i think that's really important as

8545
07:17:13,120 --> 07:17:15,040
in most cases and most of the problems

8546
07:17:15,040 --> 07:17:16,240
that we have in this country would be

8547
07:17:16,240 --> 07:17:18,638
good to have some perspective about how

8548
07:17:18,638 --> 07:17:19,920
other countries might see the same

8549
07:17:19,920 --> 07:17:21,920
situation and it turns out that that

8550
07:17:21,920 --> 07:17:24,320
isn't the most it isn't the only way to

8551
07:17:24,320 --> 07:17:27,360
divide cyber activity

8552
07:17:27,360 --> 07:17:29,040
um and i think the question at this

8553
07:17:29,040 --> 07:17:31,440
point is sort of so what right like why

8554
07:17:31,440 --> 07:17:32,878
does this matter it's not i'm just like

8555
07:17:32,878 --> 07:17:36,320
ranting about history and um

8556
07:17:36,320 --> 07:17:39,280
hoping of fear stays away from me

8557
07:17:39,280 --> 07:17:41,280
um how does this all come together into

8558
07:17:41,280 --> 07:17:43,920
something that matters now well

8559
07:17:43,920 --> 07:17:46,080
i think that this is sort of the hidden

8560
07:17:46,080 --> 07:17:48,160
structure that's informing our thinking

8561
07:17:48,160 --> 07:17:51,120
and if you see cyber power and cyber war

8562
07:17:51,120 --> 07:17:54,000
as the conceptual offspring of this kind

8563
07:17:54,000 --> 07:17:57,200
of bad progeny that we're all tussling

8564
07:17:57,200 --> 07:17:58,958
with and we don't really know our way

8565
07:17:58,958 --> 07:18:01,440
out of as a sort of society reckoning

8566
07:18:01,440 --> 07:18:03,200
with cyber

8567
07:18:03,200 --> 07:18:04,558
i think we should understand that it

8568
07:18:04,558 --> 07:18:06,798
actually shaped our adversaries in the

8569
07:18:06,798 --> 07:18:09,120
same way and i want to give you a really

8570
07:18:09,120 --> 07:18:12,160
concrete example um if does anybody

8571
07:18:12,160 --> 07:18:14,240
recognize this logo i'm going to assume

8572
07:18:14,240 --> 07:18:15,520
no

8573
07:18:15,520 --> 07:18:17,600
but essentially this is the federal

8574
07:18:17,600 --> 07:18:18,958
agency of government communications

8575
07:18:18,958 --> 07:18:22,160
information in russia from 1991 to 2003

8576
07:18:22,160 --> 07:18:24,958
um also known as fabsi fabsi was a

8577
07:18:24,958 --> 07:18:26,718
successor of two different departments

8578
07:18:26,718 --> 07:18:28,478
in the kgb

8579
07:18:28,478 --> 07:18:30,638
i am super fascinated by fabsi for a

8580
07:18:30,638 --> 07:18:32,080
variety of reasons

8581
07:18:32,080 --> 07:18:33,840
but the reason it becomes relevant here

8582
07:18:33,840 --> 07:18:36,558
is that fabsi was actually structured as

8583
07:18:36,558 --> 07:18:39,040
a facsimile of the nsa

8584
07:18:39,040 --> 07:18:41,040
what they did was they would spy on the

8585
07:18:41,040 --> 07:18:42,878
nsa and they would find out hey they

8586
07:18:42,878 --> 07:18:45,840
have five departments named abc and d

8587
07:18:45,840 --> 07:18:48,240
and they would structure fabsi to be abc

8588
07:18:48,240 --> 07:18:49,840
and d and hope to

8589
07:18:49,840 --> 07:18:50,878
sort of

8590
07:18:50,878 --> 07:18:52,798
attain some level of parody with what

8591
07:18:52,798 --> 07:18:54,718
nsa was doing at the time and this you

8592
07:18:54,718 --> 07:18:56,558
know obviously very cold war mentality

8593
07:18:56,558 --> 07:18:58,240
very back in the day

8594
07:18:58,240 --> 07:19:00,638
why does it matter to us now is well

8595
07:19:00,638 --> 07:19:02,638
fabsy was dissolved

8596
07:19:02,638 --> 07:19:06,798
and its cyber and electronic warfare

8597
07:19:06,798 --> 07:19:08,798
resources were spilling too

8598
07:19:08,798 --> 07:19:10,478
please remember electronic warfare i

8599
07:19:10,478 --> 07:19:13,200
think we all forget about ew and kind of

8600
07:19:13,200 --> 07:19:14,958
lift up cyber as the most important

8601
07:19:14,958 --> 07:19:17,200
thing look at the ukrainian conflict i

8602
07:19:17,200 --> 07:19:19,680
promise you electronic warfare is

8603
07:19:19,680 --> 07:19:21,840
playing a much bigger role in dealing

8604
07:19:21,840 --> 07:19:22,718
with

8605
07:19:22,718 --> 07:19:24,558
you know generals using walkie-talkies

8606
07:19:24,558 --> 07:19:26,638
and cell phones um

8607
07:19:26,638 --> 07:19:28,160
keep it in mind

8608
07:19:28,160 --> 07:19:30,398
now why does it matter well so i'm gonna

8609
07:19:30,398 --> 07:19:32,958
we're gonna split into two the first one

8610
07:19:32,958 --> 07:19:35,200
is something that we call center inform

8611
07:19:35,200 --> 07:19:36,718
i don't know if anybody has heard about

8612
07:19:36,718 --> 07:19:38,638
a company called center inform or a

8613
07:19:38,638 --> 07:19:40,478
company called atlas

8614
07:19:40,478 --> 07:19:43,680
um this is all now been made public by

8615
07:19:43,680 --> 07:19:45,680
the research from what journalists

8616
07:19:45,680 --> 07:19:48,000
called hakantan riverty probably

8617
07:19:48,000 --> 07:19:49,520
misspell you know mispronouncing his

8618
07:19:49,520 --> 07:19:50,320
name

8619
07:19:50,320 --> 07:19:53,040
brilliant uh researcher and journalist

8620
07:19:53,040 --> 07:19:55,360
from germany um and he put out this

8621
07:19:55,360 --> 07:19:57,760
piece right like fabsy gets split up and

8622
07:19:57,760 --> 07:20:01,600
a portion of fabsi gets added to the fsb

8623
07:20:01,600 --> 07:20:04,080
uh in the form of something included

8624
07:20:04,080 --> 07:20:07,680
called center in form as a company

8625
07:20:07,680 --> 07:20:10,558
does anybody know the names vlad uric

8626
07:20:10,558 --> 07:20:13,200
and gilg

8627
07:20:13,360 --> 07:20:15,760
okay so three well-known researchers

8628
07:20:15,760 --> 07:20:17,680
from the 2003-2007

8629
07:20:17,680 --> 07:20:20,798
era of russian operations it turns out

8630
07:20:20,798 --> 07:20:23,760
that vlad one of them worked for center

8631
07:20:23,760 --> 07:20:26,080
and form a company out of reason that

8632
07:20:26,080 --> 07:20:28,320
was officially designated as part of the

8633
07:20:28,320 --> 07:20:31,360
fsb at the time

8634
07:20:31,360 --> 07:20:32,958
center inform becomes a company called

8635
07:20:32,958 --> 07:20:35,680
atlas of the fsb also in reason if you

8636
07:20:35,680 --> 07:20:37,520
follow hakan's reporting you can

8637
07:20:37,520 --> 07:20:39,920
actually see that the fsb building in

8638
07:20:39,920 --> 07:20:42,798
reason is literally right next to the uh

8639
07:20:42,798 --> 07:20:44,638
atlas building in reassign you could

8640
07:20:44,638 --> 07:20:46,718
walk out and walk into the other one and

8641
07:20:46,718 --> 07:20:49,440
the reason that it matters is that atlas

8642
07:20:49,440 --> 07:20:53,040
of fsb was building turles components

8643
07:20:53,040 --> 07:20:56,478
for nearly a decade i mean perfect

8644
07:20:56,478 --> 07:20:59,040
um so if anybody knows terla

8645
07:20:59,040 --> 07:21:02,080
the only other

8646
07:21:02,080 --> 07:21:04,240
apt in the league of titans that was

8647
07:21:04,240 --> 07:21:06,320
around the same amount of time as

8648
07:21:06,320 --> 07:21:08,558
equation group so keep them in mind as

8649
07:21:08,558 --> 07:21:11,600
sort of this wonderful war there

8650
07:21:11,600 --> 07:21:13,440
what about the other portion well the

8651
07:21:13,440 --> 07:21:16,320
other portion was merged into the gru

8652
07:21:16,320 --> 07:21:18,718
and um i'm not gonna you know go into

8653
07:21:18,718 --> 07:21:21,600
the details of some of that because

8654
07:21:21,600 --> 07:21:23,120
they're not really to be discussed as

8655
07:21:23,120 --> 07:21:25,440
publicly but it's a portion of what

8656
07:21:25,440 --> 07:21:28,000
we've come to know as fancy bear apt 28

8657
07:21:28,000 --> 07:21:31,120
blah blah blah over the past seven years

8658
07:21:31,120 --> 07:21:33,840
or six years um then it became relevant

8659
07:21:33,840 --> 07:21:35,440
to the u.s public it was they've been

8660
07:21:35,440 --> 07:21:38,320
around 2008 or so on so

8661
07:21:38,320 --> 07:21:41,280
fapsi in all of its lineage

8662
07:21:41,280 --> 07:21:43,200
essentially splits up into some of the

8663
07:21:43,200 --> 07:21:44,798
bigger russian functions that we've been

8664
07:21:44,798 --> 07:21:47,360
dealing with to this day

8665
07:21:47,360 --> 07:21:49,120
now i'll leave you with a very

8666
07:21:49,120 --> 07:21:51,040
interesting thought

8667
07:21:51,040 --> 07:21:52,398
which is that

8668
07:21:52,398 --> 07:21:54,798
that part of the gru is actually an

8669
07:21:54,798 --> 07:21:57,920
order of magnitude smaller than its u.s

8670
07:21:57,920 --> 07:22:00,397
equivalent

8671
07:22:00,958 --> 07:22:05,039
and i think all of us would ask why

8672
07:22:05,200 --> 07:22:07,680
so far nobody has been able to identify

8673
07:22:07,680 --> 07:22:09,120
any lawyers

8674
07:22:09,120 --> 07:22:11,040
within that structure

8675
07:22:11,040 --> 07:22:13,280
and that's the team that's doing all of

8676
07:22:13,280 --> 07:22:15,360
the [ __ ] in ukraine

8677
07:22:15,360 --> 07:22:16,240
so

8678
07:22:16,240 --> 07:22:18,398
how do we compare as a relative cyber

8679
07:22:18,398 --> 07:22:20,718
power

8680
07:22:21,200 --> 07:22:22,320
and on that

8681
07:22:22,320 --> 07:22:23,680
thank you all

8682
07:22:23,680 --> 07:22:25,760

one of the most

8717
07:23:58,798 --> 07:24:02,638
difficult to earn awards in

are you a hype

8762
07:26:04,558 --> 07:26:07,840
so um one thing to call out right away

8763
07:26:07,840 --> 07:26:09,120
um

8764
07:26:09,120 --> 07:26:12,558
in my mind the ponies in in to some

8765
07:26:12,558 --> 07:26:14,160
extended extent

8766
07:26:14,160 --> 07:26:16,558
uh summer con are born completely out of

8767
07:26:16,558 --> 07:26:18,478
chaos and in the spirit of that we

8768
07:26:18,478 --> 07:26:21,360
decided to invite ophir to uh

8769
07:26:21,360 --> 07:26:24,080
add some chaos to this environment who

8770
07:26:24,080 --> 07:26:26,558
just ran out of free party favors

8771
07:26:26,558 --> 07:26:29,280

and

8796
07:27:17,840 --> 07:27:19,440
we don't like that because like i don't

8797
07:27:19,440 --> 07:27:20,878
know who the hell those people are but i

8798
07:27:20,878 --> 07:27:23,040
know who the hell you people are and in

8799
07:27:23,040 --> 07:27:24,638
my mind like

8800
07:27:24,638 --> 07:27:27,440
you know we need to pay it forward so uh

8801
07:27:27,440 --> 07:27:29,440
the pony awards are a bunch of

8802
07:27:29,440 --> 07:27:31,680
categories for all types of hacking all

8803
07:27:31,680 --> 07:27:35,120
types of bugs and depending on um

8804
07:27:35,120 --> 07:27:36,878
how good your bug is and how good your

8805
07:27:36,878 --> 07:27:39,040
nomination is it's award for exploit

8806
07:27:39,040 --> 07:27:41,600
developers by exploit developers oh yeah

8807
07:27:41,600 --> 07:27:43,120
it's pretty unique

8808
07:27:43,120 --> 07:27:45,360
wait show of hands too who here

8809
07:27:45,360 --> 07:27:49,798
nominated someone for a pony award

8810
07:27:50,240 --> 07:27:52,080
okay that's part of the problem it's

8811
07:27:52,080 --> 07:27:53,760
very international yeah that's true it's

8812
07:27:53,760 --> 07:27:54,878
very

8813
07:27:54,878 --> 07:27:56,398
very international people do submit

8814
07:27:56,398 --> 07:27:58,320
themselves for plus times

8815
07:27:58,320 --> 07:28:01,280
a lot of the time um all right so

8816
07:28:01,280 --> 07:28:03,440
what we're going to be doing today

8817
07:28:03,440 --> 07:28:05,280
is this on uh what we're going to be

8818
07:28:05,280 --> 07:28:07,600
doing today is uh we're going to go

8819
07:28:07,600 --> 07:28:08,638
through

8820
07:28:08,638 --> 07:28:10,398
all the nominees what we've done a

8821
07:28:10,398 --> 07:28:12,240
little bit differently this year is

8822
07:28:12,240 --> 07:28:14,878
we're actually selecting three nominees

8823
07:28:14,878 --> 07:28:16,398
for each category

8824
07:28:16,398 --> 07:28:20,320
that are then going to be voted on by a

8825
07:28:20,320 --> 07:28:22,878
jury of your peers um yeah because

8826
07:28:22,878 --> 07:28:24,000
typically

8827
07:28:24,000 --> 07:28:26,000
for each category we can get anywhere

8828
07:28:26,000 --> 07:28:27,200
from

8829
07:28:27,200 --> 07:28:29,600
two submissions to

8830
07:28:29,600 --> 07:28:31,600
22 depending on how popular that

8831
07:28:31,600 --> 07:28:33,120
category is

8832
07:28:33,120 --> 07:28:35,120
um another big change this year actually

8833
07:28:35,120 --> 07:28:37,840
too was uh for the longest time the pony

8834
07:28:37,840 --> 07:28:40,080
award categories were

8835
07:28:40,080 --> 07:28:41,040
um

8836
07:28:41,040 --> 07:28:43,520
like best remote or

8837
07:28:43,520 --> 07:28:46,160
it was like remote exploit or rce is

8838
07:28:46,160 --> 07:28:48,000
valid now it was something like um we

8839
07:28:48,000 --> 07:28:50,160
added a few new categories yeah we

8840
07:28:50,160 --> 07:28:51,760
updated the language to make more sense

8841
07:28:51,760 --> 07:28:54,240
like everyone knows what rce is now i

8842
07:28:54,240 --> 07:28:56,320
think when ponies started there wasn't a

8843
07:28:56,320 --> 07:28:58,798
concept of an rce category so

8844
07:28:58,798 --> 07:29:00,320
we added a few

8845
07:29:00,320 --> 07:29:01,200
um

8846
07:29:01,200 --> 07:29:03,840
so we have our rc categories lps things

8847
07:29:03,840 --> 07:29:06,080
like that do you want to get into it

8848
07:29:06,080 --> 07:29:08,080
uh yeah let's get into it check it out

8849
07:29:08,080 --> 07:29:09,760
all right so

8850
07:29:09,760 --> 07:29:12,478
this is everyone that is nominated for a

8851
07:29:12,478 --> 07:29:15,280
pony award this year

8852
07:29:15,280 --> 07:29:17,680
right uh okay this is an older slide

8853
07:29:17,680 --> 07:29:19,440
deck but

8854
07:29:19,440 --> 07:29:22,638
these slides were made today

8855
07:29:22,718 --> 07:29:24,958
okay so uh i couldn't fit everything on

8856
07:29:24,958 --> 07:29:27,120
one slide so we're just gonna gonna dive

8857
07:29:27,120 --> 07:29:29,760
right into it um we have the best remote

8858
07:29:29,760 --> 07:29:32,958
code execution the most under hyped bug

8859
07:29:32,958 --> 07:29:35,040
we have the epic achievement award and

8860
07:29:35,040 --> 07:29:36,478
then we have the best privilege

8861
07:29:36,478 --> 07:29:39,040
escalation so do you wanna call any out

8862
07:29:39,040 --> 07:29:42,000
right now or yeah i think so so rce

8863
07:29:42,000 --> 07:29:44,000
everyone remembers the microsoft

8864
07:29:44,000 --> 07:29:47,600
exchange server bugs the microsoft rpc

8865
07:29:47,600 --> 07:29:49,520
bugs that came out this year

8866
07:29:49,520 --> 07:29:50,958
um so

8867
07:29:50,958 --> 07:29:53,440
the first one comes with out of the

8868
07:29:53,440 --> 07:29:55,280
lab so that's a chinese research lab

8869
07:29:55,280 --> 07:29:57,440
that's done a lot of amazing work

8870
07:29:57,440 --> 07:29:59,840
so they're nominated as a group of

8871
07:29:59,840 --> 07:30:02,478
hackers who usually go to tian foo cup

8872
07:30:02,478 --> 07:30:05,200
prone to own things like that

8873
07:30:05,200 --> 07:30:07,600
and then the tesla rce was from phone to

8874
07:30:07,600 --> 07:30:09,360
own this year and that was pretty neat

8875
07:30:09,360 --> 07:30:11,920
it was rce over the can bus

8876
07:30:11,920 --> 07:30:13,520
that was pretty baller

8877
07:30:13,520 --> 07:30:14,718
which was pretty cool it was like

8878

black hat uh in a couple of weeks so one

8924
07:31:57,440 --> 07:31:59,520
best song was a guy who went through and

8925
07:31:59,520 --> 07:32:01,920
um he's basically incriminating himself

8926
07:32:01,920 --> 07:32:03,920
hacking his neighbors through spoofing

8927
07:32:03,920 --> 07:32:05,120
their uh

8928
07:32:05,120 --> 07:32:07,440
was it google chromebook update or

8929
07:32:07,440 --> 07:32:09,040
something something like that yeah but

8930
07:32:09,040 --> 07:32:11,360
he never shows his face so yeah that's

8931
07:32:11,360 --> 07:32:13,520
up to the authorities

8932
07:32:13,520 --> 07:32:15,440

8933
07:32:15,440 --> 07:32:17,840
actually like a kind of training montage

8934
07:32:17,840 --> 07:32:19,760

8935
07:32:19,760 --> 07:32:22,080
for a bunch of students in germany

8936
07:32:22,080 --> 07:32:24,798
and they wanted to uh talk about side

8937
07:32:24,798 --> 07:32:27,200
channels and they made a like sitcom

8938
07:32:27,200 --> 07:32:29,760
intro video that was actually quite i

8939
07:32:29,760 --> 07:32:32,798
tried to copy big bang theory

8940
07:32:32,798 --> 07:32:34,638
limited resources i thought it swung it

8941
07:32:34,638 --> 07:32:37,280
worked it was pretty good um but then we

8942
07:32:37,280 --> 07:32:39,600
have uh also a particularly interesting

8943
07:32:39,600 --> 07:32:42,240
one um dialed up by project mammoth

8944
07:32:42,240 --> 07:32:43,920
which uh

8945
07:32:43,920 --> 07:32:46,240
is actually a ctf problem inside of the

8946
07:32:46,240 --> 07:32:47,760
song itself

8947
07:32:47,760 --> 07:32:49,920
so i haven't run like listen to the song

8948
07:32:49,920 --> 07:32:51,760
yet for maybe obvious reasons but i

8949
07:32:51,760 --> 07:32:53,520
found that to be very uh

8950
07:32:53,520 --> 07:32:55,120
kind of exciting wait so then desktop

8951
07:32:55,120 --> 07:32:57,440
bugs let's see if anything

8952
07:32:57,440 --> 07:32:59,280
i mean koalas shows up again they're a

8953
07:32:59,280 --> 07:33:01,840
big hitter of course we love you we love

8954
07:33:01,840 --> 07:33:04,160
you call us

8955
07:33:04,160 --> 07:33:07,760
um all right next slide

8956
07:33:08,000 --> 07:33:10,240
and then click and then uh finishing it

8957
07:33:10,240 --> 07:33:12,718
up um we've got best crypto the lamest

8958
07:33:12,718 --> 07:33:15,040
vendor response another favorite and

8959
07:33:15,040 --> 07:33:17,440
then the most innovative research

8960
07:33:17,440 --> 07:33:20,718
um best crypto i mean hertzbleed was

8961
07:33:20,718 --> 07:33:23,680
nominated like i think 15 times by like

8962
07:33:23,680 --> 07:33:24,958
a bunch of different people i don't know

8963
07:33:24,958 --> 07:33:26,240
i'm pretty sure it's the same guy

8964
07:33:26,240 --> 07:33:29,120
nominating his team just gotta work it

8965
07:33:29,120 --> 07:33:30,718
in there that counts

8966
07:33:30,718 --> 07:33:33,680
oh uh one of my favorite ones um so one

8967
07:33:33,680 --> 07:33:35,520
of the nominees for lamest vendor

8968
07:33:35,520 --> 07:33:36,718
response

8969
07:33:36,718 --> 07:33:38,878
was uh

8970
07:33:38,878 --> 07:33:40,478
shouting out um

8971
07:33:40,478 --> 07:33:43,200
google project zero for shutting down a

8972
07:33:43,200 --> 07:33:46,320
counterterrorism operation

8973
07:33:46,320 --> 07:33:47,760
well no they found out about it through

8974
07:33:47,760 --> 07:33:49,520
tag and published through zero that's

8975
07:33:49,520 --> 07:33:52,878
true who's culpable if tag

8976
07:33:52,878 --> 07:33:54,718
whoever wants to own this

8977
07:33:54,718 --> 07:33:58,878

8978
07:33:58,878 --> 07:33:59,590

8979
07:33:59,590 --> 07:34:01,280
[Laughter]

and uh yeah then we have the uh heroku

8982
07:34:05,280 --> 07:34:07,840
science uh i think the cryptographer the

8983
07:34:07,840 --> 07:34:09,840
zero and zero one i still have to read

8984
07:34:09,840 --> 07:34:11,120

07:35:08,000 --> 07:35:09,680
those categories any of the people we've

9001
07:35:09,680 --> 07:35:11,600
mentioned and we will be reaching out to

9002
07:35:11,600 --> 07:35:13,120

9003
07:35:13,120 --> 07:35:15,600

and uh he's gonna discuss uh what went

9008
07:35:22,718 --> 07:35:24,558
into making this uh

9009
07:35:24,558 --> 07:35:27,600
beautiful ice sculpture

9010
07:35:27,840 --> 07:35:29,600
uh i was gonna

9011
07:35:29,600 --> 07:35:32,160
excuse me sir i was going to do a poem

9012
07:35:32,160 --> 07:35:37,440
recitation but i don't have my phone

9013
07:35:38,878 --> 07:35:40,718
so uh

9014
07:35:40,718 --> 07:35:42,478
long story long

9015
07:35:42,478 --> 07:35:45,040
many months ago

9016
07:35:45,040 --> 07:35:46,638
we sat down and we said okay you know

9017
07:35:46,638 --> 07:35:48,398
the pony had been along around for a

9018
07:35:48,398 --> 07:35:51,120
long time uh maybe let's make a new one

9019
07:35:51,120 --> 07:35:53,440
and i said okay fine

9020
07:35:53,440 --> 07:35:56,320
ignoring all possible input

9021
07:35:56,320 --> 07:36:00,638
i want a pony that is entirely clear

9022
07:36:00,718 --> 07:36:02,320
studded with diamonds

9023
07:36:02,320 --> 07:36:04,718
frozen in ice

9024
07:36:04,718 --> 07:36:06,000
and then

9025
07:36:06,000 --> 07:36:09,040
uh carve with the nft

9026
07:36:09,040 --> 07:36:13,120
for each award in the ice because and i

9027
07:36:13,120 --> 07:36:14,558
went on this like long thing of like you

9028
07:36:14,558 --> 07:36:15,520
know

9029
07:36:15,520 --> 07:36:18,160
we are all but just ephemera in the

9030
07:36:18,160 --> 07:36:20,320
sense of time but the algorithm is

9031
07:36:20,320 --> 07:36:22,478
forever right so

9032
07:36:22,478 --> 07:36:25,440
why not make the nft that encodes the

9033
07:36:25,440 --> 07:36:26,878
thing of value

9034
07:36:26,878 --> 07:36:29,600
stamped in ice because again we're all

9035
07:36:29,600 --> 07:36:31,680
ephemera in the sense of time and that's

9036
07:36:31,680 --> 07:36:32,878
what you're getting that's actually

9037
07:36:32,878 --> 07:36:34,718
what's happening so

9038
07:36:34,718 --> 07:36:37,718
um

9039
07:36:43,120 --> 07:36:46,638
clear pony diamonds yeah and then the

9040
07:36:46,638 --> 07:36:49,440
the actual words all each one will have

9041
07:36:49,440 --> 07:36:51,360
some slight difference and they're very

9042
07:36:51,360 --> 07:36:52,478
unique and they're going to have their

9043
07:36:52,478 --> 07:36:53,920
own nft and

9044
07:36:53,920 --> 07:36:55,280
[Music]

9045
07:36:55,280 --> 07:36:57,600
they're all going to be encased in ice

9046
07:36:57,600 --> 07:36:59,280
this is just for demos so you guys can

9047
07:36:59,280 --> 07:37:01,840
touch it and see it and whatever but

9048
07:37:01,840 --> 07:37:03,600
after you get all that grubby finger

9049
07:37:03,600 --> 07:37:05,280
[ __ ] out of the way we're going to put

9050
07:37:05,280 --> 07:37:08,478
it in ice so it's valuable again okay

9051
07:37:08,478 --> 07:37:10,320
and then we're gonna sell it and then

9052
07:37:10,320 --> 07:37:12,240
we're gonna hope that the people who

9053
07:37:12,240 --> 07:37:14,878
sell it from winning the pony will

9054
07:37:14,878 --> 07:37:17,680
actually donate it back to the pony

9055
07:37:17,680 --> 07:37:20,080
award because like obviously that's like

9056
07:37:20,080 --> 07:37:22,718
the responsible thing to do right like

9057
07:37:22,718 --> 07:37:23,760
duh

9058
07:37:23,760 --> 07:37:24,558
uh

9059
07:37:24,558 --> 07:37:26,558
what else are you gonna do and and how

9060
07:37:26,558 --> 07:37:29,200
about this if you get

9061
07:37:29,200 --> 07:37:30,878
[Applause]

9062
07:37:30,878 --> 07:37:32,240
if you get your pony and you don't want

9063
07:37:32,240 --> 07:37:33,600
to like you sell it and if you ain't but

9064
07:37:33,600 --> 07:37:34,958
you don't want to donate like well no

9065
07:37:34,958 --> 07:37:36,958
well no right it's like blockchain and

9066
07:37:36,958 --> 07:37:38,478
[ __ ] or whatever

9067
07:37:38,478 --> 07:37:40,638
it's almost as if like

9068
07:37:40,638 --> 07:37:43,280
we'll know but anyway this is the

9069
07:37:43,280 --> 07:37:47,360
prototype it has a belly button

9070
07:37:48,478 --> 07:37:50,398
just like settling the argument

9071
07:37:50,398 --> 07:37:51,920
and um

9072
07:37:51,920 --> 07:37:53,840
