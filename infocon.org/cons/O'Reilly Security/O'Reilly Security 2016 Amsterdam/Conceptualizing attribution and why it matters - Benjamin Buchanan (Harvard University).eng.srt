1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,950
certainly for nation-states a key part

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,949
of what they do is bring in external

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,540
intelligence human intelligence

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,670
satellite intelligence other geospatial

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,820
intelligence but more broadly for

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,619
nations and for companies and other

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,990
organizations we need to consider the

8
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,259
context and oftentimes technical folks

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,150
don't know the broader political context

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,310
so context is important and context can

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,590
often provide a motive for an

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,150
investigation we can observe the

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,738
opportunity in the capability of the

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,780
technical level but oftentimes we need

15
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:36,849
the operational level to spot the motive

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,530
to understand why an adversary might be

17
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,540
doing what they're doing and this can be

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,790
a key part of attribution so right away

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,250
a lot of people were assuming that North

20
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,500
Korea had hacked Sony because of the

21
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,210
movie the interview some folks like oh

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,600
no it's a head-fake by the Russians but

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,129
the obvious inclination is to move

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,379
towards North Korea and that should be a

25
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,539
factor in the process we should try to

26
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,890
run down those leads and oftentimes that

27
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,289
requires talking to folks who are

28
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,670
outside our technical teams but it's

29
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,880
very important to gather that

30
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,609
information do not take it blindly but

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,880
to use it as part of the process as you

32
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:16,329
generate hypotheses and then rule some

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,639
ideas out and rule some ideas in I just

34
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,408
said I won't belabor these questions too

35
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:23,589
much let's just move to the strategic

36
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,029
layer at this point we're going to very

37
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,909
senior people in the organization and

38
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:30,520
they need to answer some questions who's

39
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,560
responsible for ordering the attack who

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,009
took the initiative who benefits from

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,049
this what was the attacks objective in

42
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,869
most organizations these determinations

43
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,840
are made by senior folks see so level

44
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,700
and so forth their job is to marshal the

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,079
evidence and to make the determine what

46
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,869
the corporate line or the organizational

47
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,339
line is going to be they also at the

48
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,989
strategic level need to decide on the

49
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,299
response or the recommended response

50
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:57,159
when it goes out to be communicated and

51
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,380
this is where as I said I think

52
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,799
attribution is a question of politics as

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,079
well as technology for nations this

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,609
question here is not a technical

55
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,709
question we start thinking about

56
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,628
prospects of escalation we start

57
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,569
thinking about prospects of deterrence

58
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,350
we start thinking about what else might

59
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:16,480
have been breached

60
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,880
do we have full visibility into our

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
networks all of that goes into

62
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,500
determining a response and like I said

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,460
the technical analysis is necessary for

64
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,770
that but it's hardly sufficient I

65
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,690
mentioned that a we had three parts to

66
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,360
the model and they've sort of circular

67
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,540
that would be an O model this is a Q

68
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,290
model so the hook on the Q is

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,510
communications and in the Sony North

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,670
Korea FBI case for example that

71
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,190
highlights a lot of the challenges in

72
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,750
communication which is organizations

73
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,730
whether their corporate organizations or

74
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,340
government organizations don't really

75
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,619
have the ability to go out and just say

76
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,480
something is true they often need to

77
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,360
provide some evidence but the challenge

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,760
in attribution is that you might harm

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,040
some of your attribution capabilities if

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,350
you tell the adversary or tell the world

81
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,760
and thus tell the adversary how you know

82
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:14,620
what you know and nations and

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,410
organizations need to devise ways to do

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,750
communication that doesn't burn those

85
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,150
capabilities so in the case of North

86
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,730
Korea and Sony it's reported that one of

87
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,230
the reasons the United States was

88
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,510
rock-solid confident that the North

89
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,760
Korea intact sony is the United States

90
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,519
had hacked North Korean networks and was

91
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,679
looking around to see what was going on

92
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,060
not necessarily in real time close

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,670
enough to it to be confident in what

94
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,920
they found the US doesn't want to come

95
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,230
out and say this so communication is a

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,309
key challenge because you have this

97
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,109
trade-off this dilemma in revealing what

98
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,690
you know it's also a key challenge

99
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:57,100
because all organizations are reluctant

100
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,350
to admit uncertainty and the one

101
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,700
organization that often are getting

102
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,530
better at it they've had a lot of

103
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,910
practice being wrong at it is the

104
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,560
intelligence community so they've

105
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,390
developed what they call language of

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,250
estimated probability so when they

107
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,309
briefed internally they'll say this is

108
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,990
probably true this is likely true it's

109
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,700
more likely than not this is true and

110
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,230
one of the recommendations we make is

111
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,269
that organizations when they speak to

112
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,400
the public try to use this language as

113
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,590
well as well try to bring out a little

114
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,380
bit more nuance in their communications

115
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,820
and again whether or not they do that is

116
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,890
a political choice but

117
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,560
we think that ultimately leads them more

118
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,729
credibility in doing attribution and if

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,590
they can't say why they know something

120
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,880
they'll reveal that they just can't say

121
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,530
why they know something and they'll

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,930
reveal what evidence they can for a

123
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,200
particular case and state their level of

124
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,200
certainty
