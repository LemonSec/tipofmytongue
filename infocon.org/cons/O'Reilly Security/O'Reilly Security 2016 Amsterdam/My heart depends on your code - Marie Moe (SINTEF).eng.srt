1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,970
so I'm here today to talk to you about

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:14,000
how my heart might be depending on your

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:16,970
code so I'm a security researcher but

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm also a patient every single beat of

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,229
my heart is generated by medical device

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,570
a pacemaker implanted in my body five

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,680
years ago exactly five years ago

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,960
actually I woke up lying on the floor it

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,330
turned out I had fallen because my heart

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,560
had taken a break long enough to cause

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,720
unconsciousness to keep my pulse up and

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,360
to stop my heart for taking pulses I

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,690
needed to get the pacemaker implanted in

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,360
my chest so this little device is

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,670
monitoring each of my heartbeats and it

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,160
sends a small electrical signal directly

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,590
to my heart via and electrodes to keep

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,300
it beating but how can I trust my heart

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:07,430
when it's running on proprietary code

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,810
and there's no transparency when I got

21
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,909
the pacemaker it was an emergency

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,310
procedure so I needed advice is stay

23
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:16,100
alive there was really not an option to

24
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,640
not have the device it was so every time

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,580
to ask questions to surprise of my

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,340
doctors I began asking about the

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,820
potential security vulnerabilities in a

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,049
software running on the pacemaker and

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,158
possibilities of hacking is live

30
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:37,040
critical device dancers were

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,560
unsatisfying my health care providers

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,409
build answer technical questions about

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,720
infosec and many of them hadn't even

34
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,140
thought about the fact that this machine

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,429
inside of me is running computer code

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,310
little technical information was

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,110
available from the manufacturer and this

38
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,770
is why I decided to seek out this

39
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:01,130
information myself imagine that this is

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,080
your heartbeat a heartbeat being

41
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,240
controlled by a machine that is running

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,399
code inside of your body

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:16,790
would you also like to know if it can be

44
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:20,090
trusted so my life depends on hardware

45
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,970
and software as you can see from this

46
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:28,400
graph it's a print off from my previous

47
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:32,780
checkup at hospital the line that is one

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,800
hundred percent is telling how how much

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,830
of the time during 24 hours my heart is

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,720
paste so that's the ventricle the

51
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,430
ventricle is past one hundred percent so

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,250
I'm defending one hundred percent on the

53
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,819
pacemaker the lower graph is how often

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,549
the atrium is spaced at my condition is

55
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,170
not so that I need to have the upper

56
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,750
heart chamber paste at all times so this

57
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,950
is mainly paste when I false when I'm

58
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:04,040
sleeping because my pulse drops below

59
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,018
the limit which is set at 50 beats per

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,329
minute so you can configure this in

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,430
settings of the pacemaker so they put

62
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,200
out 50 be three minutes and if it drops

63
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,310
below that I'm also paste in the ass

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,100
room and you can also see the hardware

65
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,090
that is inside of my body and that I

66
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,769
have to trust with my life it's actually

67
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,160
very interesting to see how this

68
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,109
pacemaker look like inside so this is

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,950
one of the Pacemakers that I've been

70
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:37,040
looking at in my research project and

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,540
taking apart in the lab and like trying

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,739
to figure out what kind of ships are on

73
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:47,120
it because as I said there's no

74
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,850
transparency when I go to implant I had

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,370
no choice in what what type of implant

76
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,560
they put inside of me and I asked the

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,959
physician after the surgery about the

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,650
model of pacemaker and so on and I said

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,840
you got the top model the latest model

80
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:09,109
you're on the first patients having this

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,850
and it has all the features so um as a

82
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,880
security researcher I'm not really

83
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:18,019
reassured when I hear that so of course

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,070
I wanted to figure out myself how how

85
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,980
secure this is

86
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,700
how secure is my personal critical

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,700
infrastructure
