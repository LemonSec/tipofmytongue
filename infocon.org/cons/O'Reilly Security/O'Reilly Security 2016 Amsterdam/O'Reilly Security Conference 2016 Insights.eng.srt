1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:08,039
I have a great deal of respect for the

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,290
folks in the security community who do

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,110
attack but that is only one half of the

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,820
story at best one of the things that I'm

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,800
really excited about looking forward to

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,289
the O'Reilly security conference is an

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,960
opportunity for security researchers and

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:26,519
security practitioners and software

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,349
vendors and security operations folks to

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,509
get together have a chance to discuss

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,830
this stuff and really focus on defensive

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:36,570
methods and new techniques and the

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,940
trade-offs that we're all making in

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,450
terms of implementing a security

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,010
solution for real business needs a lot

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,410
of folks are talking about how to bring

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,039
big data or machine learning or

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,989
automation into defences and so what we

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,789
want to do is bring forward some folks

20
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,190
who are actually having success in that

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,879
arena and clarify what the possibilities

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,890
are what you know what new tools what

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,449
new techniques what new processes are

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,330
visibility necessary in order they will

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,539
secure essentially a pipeline that's run

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,660
by code

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,080
I feel like that you know by having a

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,729
conference is focused on those

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,310
conversations we can truly make an

30
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,400
improvement to to the tech industry as a

31
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,400
whole

32
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,280
you
