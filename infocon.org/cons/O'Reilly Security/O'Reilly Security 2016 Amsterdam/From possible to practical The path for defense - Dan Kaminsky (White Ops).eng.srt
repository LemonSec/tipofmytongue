1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
build this thing it's called autoclave

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,830
the idea is oh hey you want to go ahead

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,349
and have a femoral virtual machine it

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,969
pops up it goes ahead and you know

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,040
there's linux on the Left there's

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,020
windows on the right I'm showing this to

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,119
people I'm all it said to be like hey

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,189
I'm gonna give you hypervisor root and

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,020
you can't hack this machine people don't

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,019
care I'm like what do you mean like no

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,939
no go back like the bit hypervisor no go

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,880
back that's a web browser that I can use

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,640
that I can't get hacked if i use it i go

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,170
to some dangerous place like well yes

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,410
that's kind of the idea of a security

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,600
mom it's like these guys go crazy and I

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,360
don't understand and then I do people

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,539
are browsing the internet like they're

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,700
walking through a dangerous neighborhood

20
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,309
every click they make every site they

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,949
see every place they go they're worried

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,250
they're scared this was supposed to be

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,680
the safe place this is both we were

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,329
whatever you get pictures of cats people

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,430
are afraid and I was watching this one

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,030
moment where they had no fear because I

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,680
was taking the risk instead of them

28
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,670
that's that worries me because I don't

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,880
think that's the thing that this

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,840
internet this dream that we've created

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,289
survives we could lose this or we could

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,990
save it and you know some people think

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,100
it can't be saved some people think

34
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:33,899
security is impossible you know

35
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:38,630
apparently anything is possible when it

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,340
comes to security possible is not enough

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,530
seems nice seems it well there's some

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,229
way you could do it you could totally

39
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,079
take the completely undocumented sandbox

40
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,970
in chrome and use it for anything else

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,460
to the universe but chrome it is

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,679
certainly possible use the source Luke

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,679
you know what I never want to hear in my

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:06,119
life well it's possible to survive this

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,500
infection no the hell I want easy I want

46
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,288
easy to survive disinfection I want to

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,330
go and take a pill and live we want to

48
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,170
actually achieve our goals here we have

49
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,120
to make

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,859
security easy easy you're done doesn't

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,380
matter why something's hard there's a

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,960
universe of reasons why something can be

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,060
difficult to deploy securely it just

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,060
matters that something is hard and if

55
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,540
we're really into defense we gotta care

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,730
I see some people who don't well you're

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,980
just a stupid IT administrator if you

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,739
can't figure out the 38 steps take to

59
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,420
deploy this now why do we deploy it like

60
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,370
that why did we expect that of people we

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,980
do what was going to happen we've only

62
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,250
seen it a thousand times before human

63
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,269
factors matter it's not the first time

64
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,820
this all has happened medicine a lot of

65
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,410
people want security we be some biology

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,150
biology is the wrong thing to look at

67
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,560
the immune systems a train wreck it's

68
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,590
just a little bit of a train wreck in

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,940
the right direction um medicine though

70
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,489
security is not the first time we had a

71
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,859
bunch of garbage we're a little bit of

72
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,900
it was good and we had to figure out

73
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,540
what that little bit was and where there

74
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,459
were some was a egos but this was an

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,950
actual quote during the development of

76
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,630
the germ theory of medicine doctors or

77
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,609
gentlemen and gentlemen's hands are

78
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,950
clean the implication that a doctor

79
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,900
could move germs from one body to

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,000
another was was offensive and therefore

81
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,709
could not be considered true but you

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,620
know what science does not give a crap

83
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,820
about what your emotional say it is all

84
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,540
that cares about what works and what

85
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,350
doesn't what happens what won't you just

86
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,530
gotta push through I like the germ

87
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,450
theory so one thing I think is actually

88
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,910
somewhat applicable because germ theory

89
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,880
and medicine is focused on how does

90
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,060
disease spread and what keeps things

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,079
sterile and that maps to what I think is

92
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,170
my become my mantra well-defined

93
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,060
interfaces known good state you don't

94
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,140
know how things are communicating don't

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,120
think you could predict what they're

96
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,940
going to do and if you don't know that

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,590
something is good in the first place the

98
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,839
matter what talk to it it's already

99
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:25,270
owned that

100
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,698
medicine had some problems and they

101
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,580
measure and they monitored and they

102
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,380
learned they rebooted themself I don't

103
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,930
know if I only just discovered this like

104
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,539
the whole doctor and like a white lab

105
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,060
coat thing that's fairly new that's like

106
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,550
1880s yeah right i'm considering that

107
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,039
new but like historically there was a

108
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,990
reboot and they wanted to show the world

109
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,240
they started over and we're doing it

110
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,009
right now and started wearing new

111
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,159
clothing and it's like a hundred

112
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:58,569
something years later and it's still

113
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:01,990
part of the culture security could use

114
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,220
some rebooting we have to deliver we're

115
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,789
gonna lose this thing that we really

116
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,409
like hype man i don't know a better way

117
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,409
to get cute cats sent to me do you
