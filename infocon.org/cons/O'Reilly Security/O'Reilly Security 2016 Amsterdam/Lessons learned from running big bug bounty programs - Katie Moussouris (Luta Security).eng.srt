1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,460
so first of all let's talk about the

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:06,800
history of vulnerability disclosure and

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,530
bug bounty programs how many of you have

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,748
heard of a bug bounty program before

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,419
wonderful and how many of you are

6
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:17,330
familiar with vulnerability disclosure

7
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,800
okay thank God so quick history and this

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,959
is borrowed from my friends over at

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,400
bugcrowd one of my bounty service

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,990
provider partners and I'll talk about

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,970
the differences in some of the bounty

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,189
service providers that I work with now

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,320
that I'm independent and talked to

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,599
people more about building their voltage

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,760
or capabilities than I do even about

16
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:38,540
talking about building their bug bounty

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,699
programs so way back in the mid-90s Moza

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,710
offered the first bug bounty which was

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,290
five hundred dollars in exchange for a

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,989
security vulnerability and nothing new

21
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,290
really came up in the bug bounty world

22
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,239
until about 2010 when Google offered

23
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,739
their first bug bounty programs now at

24
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,589
the time I was with Microsoft as a

25
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,649
security strategist and they asked me

26
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,660
Katie if you were to run a bug bounty

27
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,129
program here at Microsoft what would

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,399
that look like what shape would it take

29
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,159
it only took three years of study game

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,950
theory business very economic theory in

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,659
order to come up with a plan that would

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,979
enact Microsoft's first bug bounty

33
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,260
programs and we'll talk about those in a

34
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:21,020
minute and then you see this curve of an

35
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,760
increase in adoption of these programs

36
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,429
now you've often heard about them talked

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,530
about in the news as if it's this

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,380
massive new trend and everyone's doing

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,020
it and in fact not everyone is actually

40
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,509
doing it and I'll even go further and

41
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,340
say that not everyone should do it not

42
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,750
everyone's ready so we're going to talk

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,689
about some of the capabilities you need

44
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,850
as a basis to handle vulnerabilities

45
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:46,029
whether you find them yourself or

46
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:51,679
they're reported to you from the outside

47
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:54,290
so vall disclosure to me is the absolute

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
basis for what we're doing here in terms

49
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,890
of defense all software contains

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,850
vulnerabilities and it's an

51
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,380
eventualities

52
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,149
that someone will find them and someone

53
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,158
will try and report them to you whether

54
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,720
it's your customers whether it's the

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,690
government or whether it's a friendly

56
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,220
hacker now don't feel bad if you've

57
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,109
never heard of these ISO standards

58
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,819
before they were published in 2014 and

59
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,799
they're currently under revision

60
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,909
but essentially these are guidelines and

61
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:22,129
roadmaps I said 29 147 ISO 3 0 1 1 1 in

62
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:24,709
how to handle vulnerability disclosure

63
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,969
and vulnerability remediation within

64
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:31,909
your organization but 94% of the Forbes

65
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,590
2,000 don't have a published way to

66
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,290
reach them to report a security

67
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,400
vulnerability so that means only 6% of

68
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,560
these organizations and these are

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,930
well-heeled organizations they spend a

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,939
lot of money on security and yet they

71
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,849
don't have a public method to notify

72
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,849
them so this is an ongoing problem that

73
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:51,619
we have with defense if we're trying to

74
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,629
share information about vulnerabilities

75
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,540
with each other and we don't even have

76
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,459
an email address to report them to this

77
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,379
is a this is a systemic problem that I

78
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,790
think we as defenders can do a lot to

79
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,560
address now what's the difference

80
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,780
between a vulva closure program in a bug

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,699
bounty program quite simply bug bounty

82
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,569
programs are a subset they are an

83
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,930
incentive towards disclosure and nothing

84
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,429
more

85
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,829
they are ways in which an organization

86
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,109
can shape what it is that they hear

87
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,819
about when they hear about it and what

88
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,259
kinds of vulnerability information they

89
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,189
are most interested in hearing about

90
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:28,578
from the wider world some organizations

91
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:31,040
choose to offer it on their own and

92
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,329
process it on their own and some will

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,590
offer offer these bug bounty programs in

94
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,900
concert with a bounty service provider

95
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,970
these organizations like bugcrowd hacker

96
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,299
once in AK and some others that are

97
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,579
growing here in Europe are there to

98
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,220
basically outsource parts of this

99
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,780
capability in order to make it easier

100
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,620
for organizations and governments to

101
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,970
handle vulnerability reports so we've

102
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,069
often heard how many of you have heard

103
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,139
that bug bounties may replace

104
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,198
penetration testing and have you heard

105
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:07,340
that spoken before that is something

106
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,109
that is a common way to think about the

107
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,069
return on investment for this

108
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,669
crowd-sourced

109
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:16,310
security model however bug bounty is by

110
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:18,530
nature can't really replace penetration

111
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,829
testing especially in scenarios where

112
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,299
you've got IOT devices Hardware things

113
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,789
that are much more difficult to

114
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,410
crowdsource at scale so it's a

115
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,630
complementary activity

116
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,010
and again this is a slide that's

117
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,230
borrowed from my friends over a bugcrowd

118
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,460
where they kind of weigh the differences

119
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:40,430
between using bug bounties versus using

120
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,900
a traditional penetration test so I

121
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,560
mentioned some of the bounty service

122
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,060
providers and at a glance they're all

123
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,630
similar and there are converging in

124
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,750
their capabilities but one of the things

125
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,969
that I advise my my customers on is the

126
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,400
fact that depending on their

127
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,780
organizational goals and how they want

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,330
their security team to spend their

129
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,849
resources they may or may not want to

130
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,460
outsource all or parts of their

131
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,930
vulnerability coordination or their bug

132
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,390
bounty programs to one of these service

133
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,550
providers so bugcrowd is known for being

134
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,750
easy button for triage that is wonderful

135
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,970
if you want a consistent triage

136
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,580
experience and have your security team

137
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,400
only deal with fully vetted fully

138
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,640
qualified bug submissions but if you are

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,630
sensitive about other people knowing

140
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,520
about your vulnerabilities before

141
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,540
they're fixed maybe not the best

142
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,520
solution for you

143
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,070
hacker one has the most developed

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,190
platform but it's basically for power

145
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:40,099
users on the triage team does everybody

146
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,540
know what bug triage is yes so

147
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,820
essentially it's determining whether or

148
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,690
not the bug is actually a security bug

149
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,920
whether or not that bug is actually

150
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,540
worthy of a bounty if you're running a

151
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,310
bounty program it's all of those things

152
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,210
and kind of deciding the order in which

153
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,650
you need to take on that vulnerability

154
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,539
so that's great with the hacker one

155
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,120
platform if you want a platform with

156
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,180
automation however if you lack the

157
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,400
internal talent or your internal talent

158
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,110
doesn't want to sit and do triage and

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,789
that's not necessarily the best solution

160
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,470
for you

161
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,770
finally there's Cenac which i also call

162
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,590
adult pen test friend finder which is

163
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,270
essentially closest to the traditional

164
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,640
penetration testing model where they

165
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,680
actually have a series of vetted

166
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,840
security researchers and some of them

167
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,130
could come with security clearances so

168
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,969
