1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm going to say it's the internet of

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,919
bad things because right now there's a

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,289
lot of bad things out there and they're

4
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,410
incredibly powerful machines at the edge

5
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:12,030
I chipset the cost just a few dollars in

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,360
fact probably less than a dollar can

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,029
push a megabit a second tribulation of

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,119
these things out there and they're uh

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,769
they're you know they're controlling

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,420
your thermostat there you know watching

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,538
your child they're watching your cat

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,009
your fish tank at home if endless sort

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,859
of opportunities I was at a friend's

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,980
house in Rotterdam earlier this week and

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,880
he had a hundred twenty plus IOT devices

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,699
in his house mostly light bulbs for all

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,040
types of visual effects to echoes to

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,410
ring you know the doorbells to it I mean

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,170
it's just endless and this continues

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,120
this is a hundred machines that are as

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,760
powerful as a pc i might have worked on

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,410
you know 15 20 years ago all connected

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,550
to the internet capable of driving

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,260
traffic crazy world that we live in now

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,970
and but the reason that we have these

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,039
things is they fulfill a social and

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,259
personal need so I'm not saying to stop

28
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:09,630
that and I'm not saying that I OT is is

29
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,939
the problem so let's talk about

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,509
infections human infection versus

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,570
machine infection you can compare the

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,460
two but the issues with human infections

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,979
is they tend to burn themselves out we

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,320
have yet to have that pandemic in my

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,359
lifetime and so they will burn

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,309
themselves out but with these machine

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,499
infections and particularly these this

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,200
last you know most recent set of

39
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:36,568
instances they just revert back to being

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,369
susceptible and that's where the zombie

41
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,009
metaphor is coming and is that they they

42
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,840
come alive they know they do their thing

43
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,079
they exhaust memory in the case of them

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,929
are I specific one they die off they

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,669
become susceptible again so it's a

46
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,039
zombie just waiting to come back to life

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,899
and come back to life just control based

48
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,310
on the speed of light basically the

49
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,049
Internet backbone and the ability for

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,579
scanners to so refined these compromised

51
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,319
places and you know just sort of kick

52
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,389
start the whole thing again so

53
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,539
tremendous amount of scanning activity

54
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:11,430
going on I can't really speak to the ice

55
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,799
that I'm not a security researcher but I

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,270
get what's going on here and

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,460
the more these are out there the more

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:23,570
world scans are occurring and it's just

59
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:26,010
taking off and now it in bizarrely

60
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,260
thankfully may be open sourcing Mariah

61
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,649
seems to be blunting its propagation

62
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,570
it's mutating it's fragmenting some of

63
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,640
the compromise hosts are cut off as the

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,620
injected target puts up its defenses yet

65
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,440
loses you know but possibly loses its

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,540
controller and so they fall out of the

67
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,460
network for a while but a power cycle is

68
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,079
all it's going to take at some point for

69
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,000
them to become zombies again so how are

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,510
we going to solve this survive the

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,510
zombie invasion
