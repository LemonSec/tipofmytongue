00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find at least is true with the</font>

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,370
engineering teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work on is that</font>

84
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,369
often they have not looked backwards

85
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,230
enough to realize that the problems

86
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're solving have already been solved</font>
