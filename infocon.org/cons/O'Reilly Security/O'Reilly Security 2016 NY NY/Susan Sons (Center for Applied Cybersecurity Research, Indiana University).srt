pretty good at the adversarial mindset

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,189
and picking apart where things went

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,150
wrong and the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I broke into a</font>

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,339
came with about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cards which</font>

things that were not yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> c99 compliant</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2015</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the status of the code was over</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">can't use modern tools to do static</font>

00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:09,540
neglect and the build system<font color="#E5E5E5"> was such</font>

don't mean there was a few days delay

123
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,669
and it was making me nervous

124

139
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,250
over to the side of good when the good

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
guys actually care what they're up to

141
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,539
and give them a little mentorship and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

sat<font color="#E5E5E5"> down with one of these groups one</font>

154
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,300
terrifying thing about infrastructure

155
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,310
software in particular is when you pay

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,480
your eyes people that pays for all the

158
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,170
business that pays for the people that

work at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp that pays for the</font>

technologists and we cross mentor and

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,500
then we match them up with the old guard

who are maintaining and who built<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,630
tough thing because there's a certain

showed up at my doorstep

199
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,390
there's a certain point where you just

200
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,130
have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to decide that I'm</font>

201
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:20,570
in charge of this and it is terrifying

<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's hard to feel good enough to</font>

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,550
take over something that if it fails can

204
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,330
take out the entire

the internet and so recruiting for

211
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:44,250
that's difficult on ensuring the future

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,969
of the internet and this infrastructure

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">um and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
recruitment and just getting people who

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,710
are already out there in the programming

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,930

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,590
take that leap of functional arrogance

223
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,120
and learn to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software</font>

224
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,640

to give it to me with strings that
