that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've sort of kept hearing through</font>

55
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,260
the talks and also as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked with</font>

56
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,690
people is this idea that on this

this space and information security and

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,970
in technology is such a team environment

66
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,820
and needs people from all different

67
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,980

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have but to me it felt like the</font>

97
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,470
signal-to-noise ratio on what people

98
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">focused on defense need with way up here</font>
