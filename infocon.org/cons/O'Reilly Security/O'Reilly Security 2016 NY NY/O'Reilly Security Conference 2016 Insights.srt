1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,990
I have a great deal of respect for the
folks in the security community who do

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,350
attack but that is only one half of the
story at best

3
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:15,279
one of the things I'm really excited
about looking forward to the o'reilly

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,789
security conference is an opportunity
for security researchers

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,580
security practitioners and software
vendors and security operations folks to

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,540
get together have a chance to discuss
this stuff and really focus on defensive

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,750
methods and new techniques and the
trade-offs that we're all making in

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,420
terms of implementing a security
solution for real business needs a lot

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,440
of folks are talking about how to bring
big data for machine learning or

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,050
automation into defences and so what we
want to do is bring forward some folks

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,159
who are actually having success in that
arena and clarify what the possibilities

12
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,629
are what you know what new tools what
new techniques

13
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,780
what new processes are visibility at the
fair in order to be able to secure

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,050
essentially a pipeline that's when my
code

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,020
I feel like that you know by having a
conference and focus on those

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,298
conversations we can truly make an
improvement to to the tech industry as a

17
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,950
whole

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,460
yeah

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,390
yeah
