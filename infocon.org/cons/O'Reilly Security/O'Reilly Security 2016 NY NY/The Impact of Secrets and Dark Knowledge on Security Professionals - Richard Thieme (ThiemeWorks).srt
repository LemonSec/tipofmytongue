for my own health and sanity<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,130
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-distance run</font>

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,250
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sprint and yet so often what</font>

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,680
we discover is that is managed as if it

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,720
were a sprint and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and the</font>

always apparent until it's too late to

do anything about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so having listened</font>

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,789
significant number of experiences based

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,649
on what other people are telling me not

18
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,500
only what has happened to me over that

<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore the platform on which all</font>

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,530
accelerating at the same pace and no one

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,630
can keep up with the amount of

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,570
information in the domain even if they

30

are an expert in that domain and

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,089
according to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have talked to</font>

in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> bioscience at CIA their concerns</font>

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,080
are that nobody in the world can know

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,240
what anybody else in the world is doing

35
