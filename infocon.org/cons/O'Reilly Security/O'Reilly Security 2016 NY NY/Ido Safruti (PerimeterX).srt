00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,219
has been great thanks

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,899
so perimeter<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds very interesting</font>

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,669
can you tell us a little bit about what

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,720
you guys too<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,550
so our service helps protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites we</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening the last 20 years of the</font>

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,769

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,460
tagging along the user session where you

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">parts so how do you determine the</font>

great question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean that this is</font>

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,460
not an easy task and what we're doing

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,920
for that is were collecting hundreds of

40
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,320
indications from the device itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we implement our solution which</font>

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,669
is very different from traditional

43
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,679
network security solutions is that we

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,520
don't only look at the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
network

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a payload with</font>

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,980
every website web page with every

with application itself that runs on the

49
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,360
user's device and by running on the

50
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,130
device we can collect much more

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,500
information that is very indicative to

52
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,270
the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all this information we</font>

can analyze the behavior of the other

78
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,220
you're installing something on my my

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,989
device to detect this am I getting a

82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,860
question so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> day installation is</font>

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,720
actually we don't request<font color="#E5E5E5"> require the</font>

84
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,550
user to do anything basically it's

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,930
something that comes within the website

86
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,820
or within the application of the

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,769
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you don't need to install</font>

88
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,150
any additional software device to

89
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,380
identify yourself

90
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,380
the other thing is we're very very

91
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,380
conscious<font color="#CCCCCC"> off performance I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

92
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,690
makes our product very unique is our

93
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,549
common background of the founders coming

94
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,079
from both of deep understanding and

95
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,260
background security but also

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,900
understanding of<font color="#CCCCCC"> web scale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and web</font>

infrastructure

98
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and standing the critical of performance</font>

99
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,250
the critical off of being part of the

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,869
application as opposed to a security

101
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,209
layer that you slap on top of an

102
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,650
existing application so we're collecting

there

110

<font color="#CCCCCC">usual so since you're using machine</font>

116
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,010
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> nai Indian your solution are</font>

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning what the bots are doing to</font>

118
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,560
change and to change the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

119
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,810
getting better

120
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,580
yeah are you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> stained e equal with</font>

121
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,080
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are so that</font>

122
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,440
that's that's the hardest thing

123
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,810
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're ahead of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

124
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the advantages that we have where is</font>

125
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're coming with a new approach that</font>

126
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,680
wasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried before or is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

127
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,770
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> new so it takes time to for the</font>

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">bots to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the attackers to try and</font>

129
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,789
accommodate so for now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lead</font>

130
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,650
and we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head start</font>

131
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,360
the other thing that is helpful with

132
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,789
behavioral detection is that it's not

133
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">signature-based so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can actually detect</font>

134
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,870
attacks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know off because I</font>

135
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">i see that there is something that is</font>

136
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,099
different that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that instead of</font>

137
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,359
figuring out<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I've</font>
