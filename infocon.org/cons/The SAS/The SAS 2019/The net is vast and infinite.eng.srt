here we go again a world has transformed

4
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:32,500
in unbelievable ways what was just a

5
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:36,680
crazy idea decade ago is now a reality

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,550
we are replacing everything we used to

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,510

00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:00,430
does not care anymore about what's real

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:05,229
and what's artificial it's all becoming

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:11,270
one but with every great opportunity

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:14,240
comes even greater risk a great risk to

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,670
lose yourself to disappear into the sea

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,740
of information and become a puppet of

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,310
something more powerful and evil this is

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,610
why we're here

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,950
the time has come to join us and to

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:35,320
elevate our consciousness to a higher

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,320
plane it is time to become a part of all
