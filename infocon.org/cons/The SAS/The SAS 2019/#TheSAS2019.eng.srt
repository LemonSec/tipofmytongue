00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm often being asked who I really am

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,370
only decade ago I knew the answer but

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:20,210
but not anymore

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:23,310
the world has changed we have changed it

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,400
doesn't make sense anymore we are

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,060
standing at the edge of a new form of

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,529
life a new form of perception a new form

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,529
of existence

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,980
it's time for you to know how our future

10
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:45,149
truly looks like

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,230
[Music]

12
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,469
we shall meet on the other side of the

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,468
planet
