00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:18,570
hello everyone huh Wow I have a few

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,980
words to start with we were doing so

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,930
many fantastic researches we did a lot

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,109
of exposures this years so many a PT's

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:35,309
discovered so many cyber criminals

7
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:39,270
financial gangs being exposed silence

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,468
carbonic a beer is everything we are

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,680
hunting for the really sophisticated

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,820
threats all the researchers hunting for

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,000
them they want something sophisticated

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,690
they want something to be published they

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,980
want to impress everyone but for the

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:06,539
last few years we forget about one old

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:10,140
pink that actually brings more direct

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:15,659
money than any apt any financial cyber

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:19,890
crime gang anything together the carding

18
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,960
I don't see any recent researches about

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,430
guarding actually see a big one that

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,139
everyone is speaking about it

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:32,610
unfortunately because the carding is not

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:38,970
dead more than this it leaves and shines

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,890
and for some researchers it's expected

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,990
to reach thirty two billion applauses by

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,180
the global cybercrime financial fraud

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,880
ATM skimmers carrying everything is in

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,270
there in these numbers and the carding

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,339
still has a huge part of this in the

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,020
next year by some researches it will

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,820
exceed 35 billion

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,210
40 percents in in USA it's not dead it

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,210
lives

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,210
I've been monitoring Guardian candor

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:16,089
quorum for the last 15 years and the

35
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,480
funny thing is it's all started on a few

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,260
small forums like Carter planet who

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,880
remember Skaar the planet right not so

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,670
many people remember scarred the planet

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,600
well probably that Carter plane is older

40
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:34,809
than some security researchers actually

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,760
and when I started to monitor it I was a

42
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,890
police officer it was 15 years ago I was

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,109
in the cybercrime investigation unit I

44
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,029
was looking into the bad guys I was

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:48,040
looking for the Carters I was interested

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:51,810
and the carding is a starting point for

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,480
many new cyber criminals dark korea

48
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,580
nowadays 15 years ago i was looking into

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,250
the dark forums and i was searching for

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,430
the threats and the stress was like how

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,190
i want to become a hacker how can i be

52
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,170
as a big guy sitting there for say hey

53
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:14,310
go to the carding forum learn how to

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:18,040
kick him stolen credit card information

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,000
alright and I'm monitoring dark forums

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,120
now I go to the dark market I go to the

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,730
dark forum and what's Red's I see hey

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,830
mommy how can I become a hacker go to

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,268
the carding forum and start to steal

60
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:38,410
credit card information the carding

61
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:41,860
today is not the carding it was 15 years

62
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,440
ago because in that time you only need a

63
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,950
credit card data information like a

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,950
number

65
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,859
maybe the expiry date and you go to the

66
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:55,929
shop into this information and boom you

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,060
will buy something then a laptop

68
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,030
whatever it is and then you can send it

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,620
to the drop location or something like

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:08,500
this but the thing is that protection

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,459
mechanism really developed for the last

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,349
15 years definitely and it's not so easy

73
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,870
right now if you have a credit card

74
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,219
information stolen it's not so easy just

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,320
to put it

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,100
inside the shop inside the payment

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,030
system and steal money from here but

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,550
beef beef is a Russian slang word to

79
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:36,729
enter stolen information is still exist

80
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,420
it's still there and a lot of new

81
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:45,280
carries are doing this bill but it's not

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:48,450
so easy because the thing is that for

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:54,280
the last 15 years we have something that

84
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:57,520
called anti-fraud systems and when I

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,669
started this research I started to learn

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,440
what is a normal typical anti-fraud

87
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,980
system how it works

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,900
what it do how it protect us how to

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,330
protect payment system how it protects

90
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,669
shops from heartless and when I started

91
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,300
to research at first I thought that the

92
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,510
anti-fraud system work like this this is

93
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,820
anti-fraud system it initiates its

94
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,010
protection protocols

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:31,620
it's the carters and finally a decision

96
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:34,210
to block the transaction right easy

97
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,350
should work like this should block the

98
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:42,370
transaction very simple few of these and

99
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,380
everything is blocked right but when I

100
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,890
start to research further when I go

101
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:52,830
deeper I actually started to think that

102
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,830
I'm different systems work like this

103
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:03,449
okay this is me Smith from Boulder

104
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:07,030
Colorado and her transaction was blocked

105
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,949
she's like what what happening well the

106
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,739
problem is that the anti-fraud systems

107
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:15,009
is really hard to configure properly I

108
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,379
mean if you overpower them they will

109
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:20,830
become and they will bring too many

110
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:24,759
false positives they will block many

111
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,020
legitimate transactions and it's much

112
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,940
harder to like to implement the system

113
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,940
all the technologies that being used in

114
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,909
there in a proper way to detect all the

115
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,349
carding transactions doesn't matter if

116
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,050
it's a credit cut if it's a payment

117
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:46,120
system fraud if it's a online banking

118
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:50,620
fraud doesn't matter there is an t4

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,990
system are a few words how their modern

120
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,930
anti-fraud system works and how it looks

121
00:06:52,990 --> 00:07:00,069
like it looks like an imperial star

122
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:04,139
destroyer but unfortunately not on any

123
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,139
Star Destroyer there is a GA with a bomb

124
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:13,090
good and different system how it works

125
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:15,099
it works in different kind of ways it

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,198
works in different kind of modules by

127
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,340
the basic thing is that the anti-fraud

128
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,529
system first doing a device fingerprint

129
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,159
your browser when you enter online

130
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:29,620
banking site or online shop collects a

131
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,449
lot of information about your system it

132
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,580
collects various data like your screen

133
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,469
information device build operation

134
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,270
system version even the battery

135
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,849
information even the vendor of your

136
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,620
graphical card GPU or audio unit it's

137
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:43,539
all done by the web scripts this

138
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,069
information is being collected it could

139
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:50,469
be it's possible even like there is a

140
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:54,550
passive TCP IP fingerprint passive

141
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:59,440
different kind of checks so actually and

142
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:03,590
different system takes digital

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,560
fingerprint of your identity of you

144
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,719
sounds nice right really nice protective

145
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,460
technology actually the social networks

146
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,530
doing the same thing and themselves your

147
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,138
data into the advertisers do you think

148
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:22,349
this is bad but in this case this is

149
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:25,290
good the anti-fraud system started to

150
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:28,590
evolve and they studied not to only

151
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,050
collect this information they started to

152
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,779
collect advanced analytic using machine

153
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,140
learning algorithms it started to

154
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:40,710
collect to understand for example for

155
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,790
what time a cook here lives inside your

156
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:50,850
system what time you spent on the shop

157
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:57,240
inside what did you click what actually

158
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:59,960
your mouse or touchscreen behavior it

159
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,820
started even to analyze if you have a

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,110
social network account using the

161
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,570
third-party cookie because it's well it

162
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,940
sounds funny but if you don't have a

163
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,920
social network account you don't have

164
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,750
Facebook you don't have other social

165
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,900
networks if you try to buy something you

166
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,740
will be flagged as suspicious because

167
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,140
you are not real

168
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,839
everyone has social network account and

169
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,670
of course you have a cookie of this

170
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,670
I can't install ins your browser

171
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,269
this is how the fingerprint check

172
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,910
example looks so there are various sites

173
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:45,839
inside internet that you can simply go

174
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,329
and your fingerprint will be analyzed

175
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,420
and you will get exact data what it's

176
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,180
collecting sorry like I always told

177
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,059
about the device fingerprint phones give

178
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,459
opposition times on your browser headers

179
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:05,040
and so on and so on and so on and so on

180
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:07,709
and everything sounds really complicated

181
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,719
really nice more than 100 parameters to

182
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:14,998
be checked and finally when the

183
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,620
anti-fraud system collects all this data

184
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:24,740
it making a decision if you fingerprint

185
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:27,990
completely unique and was used already

186
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,939
to make a legitimate transaction using

187
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:36,749
your credit card or to make a legitimate

188
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:38,730
buy in the shop you are becoming a

189
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:40,920
legitimate a trusted user for the

190
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,519
anti-fraud system it puts you inside the

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,339
database and next time you come to do

192
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,059
the same to by Thomson you will be

193
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,680
legitimate and it will not ask you any

194
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,930
additional questions it will not ask you

195
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,199
for your credit card number it will not

196
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,000
ask you for some additional verification

197
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,920
not any of course it depends on region

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,860
heavily usually in the United States it

199
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,219
doesn't ask anything because Miss Smith

200
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,959
from Colorado she doesn't know this

201
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,879
information she don't want to provide

202
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:19,199
any additional verification two-factor

203
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:24,120
stuff or your fingerprint should be

204
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:27,500
completely unique it may be not in the

205
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,939
system at all but it should be unique it

206
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,689
shouldn't have any patterns for example

207
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:37,290
of the virtual machines or some known

208
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:38,639
anonymizing software or tor browser and

209
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,579
so on and so on

210
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,660
if antipode sees that the your digital

211
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:47,739
fingerprint looks like known it will

212
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:53,180
burn you

213
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,910
so actually final decision is blog the

214
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,420
transaction hold the transaction form

215
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,790
manual verification it will ask you to

216
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,040
input additional unlined information

217
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,040
like cv v expiry date and so on and so

218
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,990
on or it will understand that you are

219
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,270
legitimate and that will confirm the

220
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:19,580
transaction so final decision make you

221
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:21,500
should be known or unique but the best

222
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,020
thing that the cyber criminal is fully

223
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,810
aware of this and here's the

224
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,579
doppelganger scalp

225
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:32,000
they found waves how to use a special

226
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,390
malware to steal your fingerprint from

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,030
your PC and to bypass and ID fraud

228
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,010
system quite easily now imagine a

229
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,230
malware and imagine the things that you

230
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,290
anti fraud bypass the rule number one be

231
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,540
a trusted copy there is a malware who

232
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,550
infect the PC dumps your logins and

233
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,380
passwords steals your cookies system

234
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,060
information makes a full fingerprint

235
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:59,000
device in the print of your system and

236
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,530
send it to the cyber criminal if Samba

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,870
criminal somehow can take this

238
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:06,290
information put it inside his machine or

239
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:10,550
his browser take a proxy like by a

240
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:12,949
proximal special side that is proxy in

241
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,849
some state or the same city as a

242
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,450
legitimate user he can also emulate the

243
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,310
trusted activity and then he goes to

244
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:26,840
your account that he stole on the first

245
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,530
step eBay Amazon whatever it is doesn't

246
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,110
matter

247
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,240
he will log in and the system will not

248
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,040
ask any questions he will try to

249
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,930
initiate the transaction and buy

250
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,030
something and information about your

251
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,489
credit cut are already in the system he

252
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,230
didn't need to enter it the system

253
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,600
things that you are legitimate and it

254
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:49,390
will allow you to buy anything and sent

255
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,390
it to the drop in address

256
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,939
when I was researching this thing I

257
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:59,980
found this bad guy meet at Genesis

258
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,370
Genesis is a biggest market of the

259
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:07,750
stolen accounts stolen fingerprint

260
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:11,260
database stolen what that includes

261
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,120
global fingerprints a bad guy could come

262
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,140
to the genesis market and Hickey

263
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,360
searched for boots on sale more than

264
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:23,199
sixty thousand stolen fingerprints are

265
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,620
right now in there everything is there

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,470
all the accounts like like payment

267
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,470
system banking accounts social networks

268
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,190
email accounts everything is on sale at

269
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:39,779
the moment right there and I can see

270
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:42,839
that the bad guy can search for any

271
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,400
popular website he want to get access to

272
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,690
bank in a key again account on payment

273
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,600
system and so on and so on

274
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,980
there is a details when the bad guy buys

275
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,680
a boat he can after he bite he will get

276
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,740
in immediate information login and

277
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,319
password cookies and the fingerprint all

278
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,150
this data is very searchable the bad

279
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
guys could search for this information

280
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,779
he could buy a boat from a special

281
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,479
countries special cities everything or

282
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,010
resource name and so on and so on he can

283
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,130
look for the credit cards already

284
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:24,880
sniffed by the web inject and so on and

285
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:27,430
so on also he can only not buy stolen

286
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,310
fingerprint in the same market he can i

287
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,260
generate unique fingerprint just with

288
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,529
the three clicks he can choose the ratio

289
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,600
system he can choose browser and fully

290
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,390
unique fingerprint would be generated

291
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,459
and he can use it after then he bought

292
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,860
by a credit card information on some

293
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,790
other side and the anti-fraud system

294
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,490
will think okay

295
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,939
this profile is unique I never see it

296
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,100
before

297
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,839
probably it's a user first time

298
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,980
legitimately came to my site

299
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,980
he wants to buy phones

300
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,280
more than thirds the bed gas implemented

301
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,790
a special plugin for the chromium based

302
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,850
browsers and when the customer install

303
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,630
this plugin he can in one click from

304
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,440
this genesis market install just bought

305
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,530
stolen profile and in one click he

306
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,570
became a doppelganger a full copy of the

307
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:23,089
legitimate users with all the logins and

308
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,210
passwords cookies and the fingerprint

309
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:29,240
information that's how the anti-fraud

310
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,900
system could be bypassed this is the

311
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,590
example of this site there is a lot of

312
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,240
configurable a lot sorry example of the

313
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,580
plugin there are a lot of configurable

314
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,930
information everything could be changed

315
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:46,700
like user agent IP address WebRTC and so

316
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,520
on and so on you see how many cookies

317
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,660
are available for import from the stolen

318
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,579
board you can see there is a vendor of

319
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,790
the graphic card that anti-fraud system

320
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,590
checks everything could be easily

321
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,980
manipulated everything could be very

322
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:09,680
adjustable to make the needs of the

323
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:14,650
cyber criminal the rule number two like

324
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:19,490
I said be unique in case of Genesis we

325
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:23,560
just buy two about stolen information

326
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,150
and use it in our cases and actually

327
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,589
it's quite amazing because I didn't

328
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,220
think that it would be like sixty

329
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:33,760
thousand variants of this information to

330
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,820
be bought and there are many tools

331
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:42,050
actually on the carding forum that works

332
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:45,950
almost the same for example the sphere

333
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,840
browser tenebris company they position

334
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,990
themselves at companies that provide an

335
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:56,030
anonymity but actually they created a

336
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:59,000
browser used mostly 99% for cardiac it's

337
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,649
a non tool for the ten years it's known

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,500
in the cardi community everyone knows

339
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,560
about it it's not a plugin it's a fully

340
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,330
prepared browser that actually he is in

341
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Russian the description on the official

342
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,760
website

343
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,350
it's paid you have to pay its owners

344
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,560
$100 per month to get full access to the

345
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:23,810
browser or $500 there are six months on

346
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:25,940
$1,900 per year it's it's a licensing

347
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,760
system and if you pay this money to the

348
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,840
bad guys you will get a fully

349
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,390
customizable browser that fingerprint

350
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,850
could be customized in any way you like

351
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,340
more than that it could be generated

352
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,010
more than that it's possible to import

353
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,919
stolen fingerprint into this browser you

354
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,280
can choose platform you can be anything

355
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,560
Linux Windows Android you can choose any

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,610
parameter in the digital fingerprint

357
00:18:51,560 --> 00:19:00,169
that you can adjust and then use this

358
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:02,209
browser to access shop beef chicken

359
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:06,590
stolen credit card information and

360
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:10,220
anti-fraud system would be bypassed this

361
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:13,699
is the example of the test using the

362
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,550
sphere browser typical site that checks

363
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:20,150
for fingerprints you see your anonymity

364
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:23,149
100% your anonymity measures are safe or

365
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,190
you don't use them the system thinks

366
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,610
that this one guy is not using them it's

367
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,940
completely unique it has timezone

368
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:35,409
location and every other stuff that

369
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,410
looks completely legitimate

370
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,700
another example of the fingerprint check

371
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:47,070
even the installed plugins could be fake

372
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,100
even their phones could be fake screen

373
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:54,300
size HTTP headers everything would be

374
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,570
fake so you can ask how to mitigate this

375
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,620
stuff how to fight against this thing

376
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,919
first of all is to use two-factor

377
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:09,149
authentication on any transaction it's

378
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,220
not useful but it absolutely should be

379
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:15,780
implemented right now it doesn't matter

380
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,590
if you stay on the website shop for

381
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,560
weeks

382
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,530
any new transaction there should be

383
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:26,610
additional two-factor authentication

384
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:28,800
any new initiation of the money transfer

385
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,750
from payment system a two-factor a

386
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,389
sophistication should immediately

387
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:39,140
trigger it doesn't matter if SMS on the

388
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:45,300
phone or a token authentication device

389
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:50,490
that how Cardian lives know to F a money

390
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,290
is being lost another few points its new

391
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,700
methods for additional verification

392
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:59,430
I don't know biometric information heavy

393
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,230
usage of the neural networks new

394
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,380
additional verification and holistic

395
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,660
system of user behavior banking agents

396
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:13,020
installed on PC well it's against GDP

397
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,470
are the factor is everything and trust

398
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,970
me

399
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:23,360
Cardon lives for 20 years and it will

400
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:28,580
live for the next 20 - thank you

401
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,580
[Applause]
