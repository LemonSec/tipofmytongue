[Music]

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,719
so hi there thank you for coming out

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,149
welcome to SAS as David mentioned last

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,539
year I came up here and I talked about a

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,520
new apt and this time I am up here to

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,250
talk to you about stalker wear and

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,470
spouse wear so this is going to be a

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,119
much less technical and sort of policy

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,679
influenced talk I always feel a little

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,079
bit guilty if I get up here and I don't

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,820
actually have a new apt for you so we

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,989
begin by traveling back to 2017 or as we

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,129
call it the beforetime so at the end of

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,699
2017

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,710
I discovered that a security researcher

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,430
with whom I had been publishing research

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,210
for many years was a serial rapist and

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,989
at the beginning of 2018 an article was

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,250
published in which one of his victims

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,210
specifically said that one of the

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,820
reasons why she had not come out and

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,860
said anything about it was that he was a

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,750
security professional and that he had

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,400
threatened to compromise her devices and

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:25,799
so she felt really powerless and scared

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:28,409
well I was a little mad and I did what

27
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,560
any reasonable person would do when

28
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,450
their catastrophic ly angry which was I

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,280
tweeted and what I tweeted was if you're

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,570
a woman who has been sexually abused by

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,939
a hacker who threatened to compromise

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,130
your devices contact me and I will make

33
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,089
sure that they're properly examined and

34
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,130
I thought I thought that this was no big

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,670
deal I thought that maybe I would hear

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,100
from like one or two people maybe half a

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,380
dozen people I'd help like a couple of

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,509
people I would feel good about myself

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,908
I would sort of cover that nobody ever

40
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,619
has to feel that scared again feeling I

41
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:11,030
was wrong

42
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:13,310
so ninety four hundred retweets later

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,459
I appear to have accidentally started a

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,870
project and I'm spending all of my time

45
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,360
desperately fighting not starting a new

46
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,740
NGO which is the most popular pacify of

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,959
among people who work for the Electronic

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,750
Frontier Foundation we are activists

49
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:34,100
whose hobby is also activism so I heard

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:37,100
from a lot of people I got somewhere

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,319
between zero and twelve contacts a day

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,060
there were definitely some months where

53
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,820
things calm down a little bit and I was

54
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,060
able to do I don't know other work but

55
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,790
for the most part I heard from people

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,640
almost every day contacting me via email

57
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:57,220
and on Twitter and for some strange

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,170
reason on Instagram and via you know

59
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,280
facebook Messenger you know carrier

60
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:08,450
pigeon all the usual things and I heard

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,640
from mostly women and the abusers were

62
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,470
mostly men but I would like to make it

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,470
clear that there were cases of women

64
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,040
abusing men and also that there were

65
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,769
cases of abusive same-sex couples for

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,900
example one of the men who came into my

67
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,150
office and had me take a look at his

68
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,420
devices and review all of his all of his

69
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,299
accounts was a man whose abusive partner

70
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,458
had among other things outed him as gay

71
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:40,280
to his extremely conservative Korean

72
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:42,230
family so one of the biggest problems

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,290
that I encountered when people started

74
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,910
contacting me left and right is that it

75
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,790
turned out I was wrong about what people

76
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,590
needed this is not unusual it's really

77
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,630
common for people like me to come you

78
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,630
know barreling into a situation going

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,100
you need forensics it turns out how they

80
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,570
didn't need forensics most people

81
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,260
couldn't distinguish between a device

82
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,030
compromise and a compromise of their

83
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,260
account because that's just not one of

84
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,870
those things that comes up in ordinary

85
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,660
people's lives they also couldn't

86
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,180
distinguish between a real threat and a

87
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,519
scam there is extremely common scam

88
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,500
going around in the last year of people

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,320
receiving emails saying I have installed

90
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,450
a rat on your computer I have

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,760
pictures of you masturbating and I am

92
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,920
going to send these pictures of you and

93
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,250
your masturbation to everyone in your

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,000
contact list unless you send Bitcoin

95
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,280
this is

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,500
it never happens you can freely delete

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,760
that and boy was I happy that many of

98
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,150
the people who I was contacting they

99
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,070
were really easy to help in that way but

100
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,159
I also got a lot of people with account

101
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,620
compromised their accounts their email

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,300
accounts were compromised Google Drive

103
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,910
accounts were compromised Facebook

104
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,220
accounts Twitter accounts snapchat

105
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,310
accounts Instagram accounts whatsapp

106
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,940
Apple ID if it has a login it was

107
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:09,020
compromised I saw a whole lot of that

108
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,700
and the nice thing about sort of login

109
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,180
compromised and account compromised is

110
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,229
that I know what to tell people we have

111
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:20,480
solutions for that so what I did was I

112
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,090
wrote up a little a little email and I

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,770
explained that if you are worried about

114
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,739
account compromised what you do is you

115
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,799
go and you look to see what devices have

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,380
been logging into your account you use

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,530
strong unique passwords you use a

118
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,969
password manager you need to be careful

119
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,099
with your security questions especially

120
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,590
if you're worried about an attacker who

121
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,380
knows you very well and can guess the

122
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,940
answers to your security questions and

123
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,200
use the highest level of two-factor

124
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,670
authentication that is feasible for you

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,500
there are people in this room who will

126
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,620
quibble with this advice will say that

127
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,390
2fa is bad there will also be people who

128
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,110
say that unless you are using a token

129
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,090
why do you even bother and I advocate

130
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,790
for the harm reduction approach which is

131
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:11,000
use as much security as I could get you

132
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,820
to use if I gave the people who came to

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,100
me advice to do things that they then

134
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,080
did not do then all I'm doing is making

135
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,940
myself feel good for giving such good

136
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,940
advice and I'm not actually helping them

137
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,840
but sometimes sometimes it really is a

138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:33,140
wrap and those were actually a lot of

139
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,760
the most heart wrenching experiences a

140
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,729
lot of the times the people who came to

141
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,909
me were terrified a lot of this tracking

142
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:44,540
went hand-in-hand with physical abuse

143
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:48,200
threats blackmail the abuser frequently

144
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,440
had physical access to their devices and

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,270
the abuser was able to guess or compel

146
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,020
the victim to give up their passwords

147
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:59,390
it was extremely common to talk to

148
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,820
people who had their accounts

149
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:05,450
compromised in the most straightforward

150
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:09,020
way I told him what my password was he

151
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:11,090
said that if I loved him he would that I

152
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,849
would share my email password and that I

153
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,229
would have nothing to hide from him and

154
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:21,920
now all of these bad things are

155
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:24,800
happening to me now I see only a small

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,710
fraction of the sort of infections that

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,350
we see in the wild and one of the

158
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,750
reasons for that is that I was using a

159
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:36,110
self-selecting sample I was using I was

160
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,660
talking only to people who were being

161
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,580
threatened and I discovered something

162
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,950
really interesting which is that the

163
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,609
kind of hackers who threaten their

164
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:50,330
victims with a rat are usually full of

165
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,930
 they don't install a rat on

166
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,880
anyone's device because if they did

167
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,540
they'd stay quiet in order to maintain

168
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,420
their access usually the threat was just

169
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,720
a way of keeping their victim in line

170
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,060
keeping them cowed and unable to

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,520
understand the size and shape of the

172
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,080
surveillance that they were facing they

173
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,609
got what they wanted without ever having

174
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,750
to install a rat

175
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,570
hackers are lazy but there were also

176
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,330
situations in which I encountered

177
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,849
victims who had had rats installed on

178
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:30,190
their on their devices on their on their

179
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,599
iPads on their phones on their PCs and

180
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,370
they came to me pretty much every day

181
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:42,919
and I did sort of a combination of first

182
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:45,950
responder therapist hand holder threat

183
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,680
analyst thing and it was not

184
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,860
particularly great for my mental health

185
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,670
now we call this

186
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:59,570
in an activism we refer to this as the

187
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:02,240
hero model everything goes through me I

188
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,220
get to feel extremely heroic and smug

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,010
because I'm helping people

190
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,670
I get fancy profiles in Wired in which I

191
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,490
look off into the distance heroically

192
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,560
and it's

193
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,529
this doesn't scale this is not

194
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,140
sustainable and it will only drive you

195
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:26,540
crazy so I'm here to tell you kill your

196
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:29,899
heroes just kill them right now so in

197
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:34,250
addition to not being that technical I

198
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:36,860
am also extremely lazy so I didn't want

199
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,500
to continue doing this sort of frontline

200
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,120
tech support for people telling me the

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,190
worst thing that had ever happened to

202
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,800
them day after day after day and I

203
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,410
started to think about how I could get

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,050
more bang for the buck how I could make

205
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:54,439
a bigger difference without having to

206
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:59,569
individually help people one by one or

207
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,890
as we call it thought leadership so I

208
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,690
have a device for people with

209
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,490
compromised accounts but the worst

210
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,620
abuses that I was seeing were the result

211
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,269
of compromised devices mostly Android

212
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:14,390
phones running spouse wear and stalker

213
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:17,660
wear this sort of software is really

214
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:21,170
prevalent and it's tempting phones are

215
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,370
juicy targets for for abusers for

216
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,000
exactly the same reason that they're

217
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,220
juicy targets for a PT's your phone

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,260
gives away your location your emails

219
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,019
their text messages your whatsapp

220
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,209
messages your photos your snapchats your

221
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:38,329
Instagram messages your web browsing

222
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,569
your searches your phone is basically an

223
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:44,000
extension of your mind and that is

224
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,440
extremely useful for abusers in the same

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,480
way that is extremely useful for

226
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,820
nation-states so how do we know it's

227
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,390
spouse where this is actually way easier

228
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:01,160
than finding samples of you know of a

229
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:03,709
PT's you google it all you really need

230
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,510
to do is go Google how can I spy on my

231
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,819
husband's cell

232
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:11,380
how do I spy on my wife's cellphone and

233
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,290
see who's buying these ads who is

234
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,170
positioning themselves in this SEO I

235
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,770
this is a product it has to sell

236
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,329
somebody has to aim it at people so that

237
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:27,790
actually makes this job way way easier

238
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:30,670
than what I usually do this is a

239
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,790
screenshot from a product called cocoa

240
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:37,750
spy again they will tell you their

241
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,280
spouse where the website says access to

242
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,320
cocoa spy gives you the lead on how to

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,390
spy on your wife with ease you do not

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,580
have to worry about where she goes who

245
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:50,819
she talks to or the website she visits

246
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:55,000
this is particularly endearing this is a

247
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,760
archived screenshot from Hello spy I it

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,480
is an entire page on how useful Hello

249
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,030
Spy is for catching your your cheating

250
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,760
spouse and as you can see there is a

251
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,189
picture of a man holding a woman who is

252
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,680
looking away with a bruised and bloody

253
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,770
face and I want you to understand that

254
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,489
hello Spy is on the side of the abuser

255
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:20,949
in this picture that is the entire point

256
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,320
of the product you can be that blonde

257
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:29,500
dude catching your cheating wife giving

258
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:31,510
her a shiner good work and honestly the

259
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,830
hacker community has has played along

260
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:40,920
with this uh in 2012 this is jean

261
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:44,050
careless suru shut down his his rat

262
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,860
project called dark comet and the reason

263
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:50,410
that he shut it down was someone me and

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,210
also some other people wrote over a

265
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,900
dozen reports about it being used by

266
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,780
pro-assad hackers in Syria against the

267
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,689
opposition wired coverage was

268
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,300
hilariously as sympathetic the title

269
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,420
that they used for their article on him

270
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,109
was how the boy next door accidentally

271
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,170
built a syrian spy tool and what he said

272
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,810
was i never imagined that this product

273
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,890
would be used by governments and what he

274
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,739
didn't say

275
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:25,810
was I was totally fine with it being

276
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:28,930
used by abusive husbands and other other

277
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:32,560
actors with you know the blonde guy in

278
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,910
the previous shot so for a very long

279
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,680
time we thought that this sort of thing

280
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,930
was really okay again how can you tell

281
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,540
its spouse where deception is the key

282
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,479
there are lots of products that you can

283
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:50,050
use to keep an eye on your employees to

284
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,670
keep an eye on your on your children

285
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,109
even to keep an eye on your spouse but

286
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,149
what I'm particularly concerned about

287
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,779
our products that are designed to run on

288
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,570
a device covertly and yes I mean that

289
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:08,399
even if you have the phone's password or

290
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:11,320
their Apple ID credentials I would not

291
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,300
equate that to consent especially in

292
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,180
these abusive situations where people

293
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,680
are compelled to hand over their login

294
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:23,170
credentials and right now we're doing a

295
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,660
lousy job of detecting these products

296
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,189
it's not particularly hard to signature

297
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:33,490
spouse wear but as you can see here as I

298
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:36,820
revved up a copy of virustotal what we

299
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,670
have here is a detection of 7 out of 60

300
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,339
products I think this is cocoa spy

301
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,329
[Music]

302
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:51,130
slightly better 10 out of 61 recognizing

303
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:52,839
the truth spy dye apk so we're doing a

304
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,810
lousy job

305
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,010
so last week because Persky decided that

306
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,319
maybe they should do something about

307
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,240
this and they made an announcement

308
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,630
saying that they were going to make a

309
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,230
change to the way that they treat spouse

310
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:10,480
wear and not only are they going to

311
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,670
recognize spouse wear in their AV

312
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,880
product but they've decided to change

313
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,579
the way in which the alert comes up so

314
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,339
the new alert looks like this this is a

315
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,339
privacy alert it specifically calls out

316
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,750
the spouse where as malicious and that's

317
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:30,089
one of the things I would really like to

318
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,089
see other antivirus companies doing

319
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:41,860
one of the interesting things that the

320
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,128
Kaspersky announcement says quite

321
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:49,230
explicitly is that these products are

322
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:51,519
legal and in some cases they are legal

323
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,259
again it depends on where you are it

324
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,670
depends on what the what the law is and

325
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,860
how it is being used and how they're

326
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,809
being advertised but what there's no

327
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,139
question about in my mind is that these

328
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:04,689
products are unethical it is not up to

329
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:07,749
the AV industry to make calls about what

330
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:10,059
is legal or illegal and if it's if it's

331
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:13,809
legal we live it we leave it alone we

332
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:18,009
have an ethical obligation to mark these

333
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:19,870
products as malicious antivirus should

334
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,040
not automatically remove this product

335
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,569
because victims should have a choice

336
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,800
about whether or not they wish to alert

337
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:26,079
their abusers that they know they're

338
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,209
under surveillance the abuser may

339
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,998
escalate to violence and our first duty

340
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:34,660
I say having stolen this directly from

341
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,559
doctors is to first do no harm for

342
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,959
people who don't feel comfortable

343
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,610
installing Kaspersky's products and let

344
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,250
me tell you my twitter feed is full of

345
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,839
these people right now all I can say is

346
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,759
that other companies should catch the

347
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:53,290
hell up so that I can recommend some

348
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:55,389
alternatives so AV is not the only actor

349
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,149
in this area there are some things that

350
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,920
Google can do in my survey of spouse

351
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,600
where I know just that some of it still

352
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,589
shows up in the Google Playstore even

353
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,770
though products that that monitor

354
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,230
surreptitiously and that are designed to

355
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,089
to be covert on your phone are I think

356
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,740
against their Terms of Service so

357
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:20,408
they're supposed to remove them I have a

358
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,120
sort of crazy pie-in-the-sky vision for

359
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:24,220
something that Apple can do which is

360
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,369
that I I see that a lot of the spouse

361
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,890
where for iOS depends on jailbreaks

362
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,928
and it would be nice if Apple could find

363
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,640
a way to alert users when their phone

364
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,280
has been jailbroken so it cannot be done

365
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,280
covertly I understand that this is not a

366
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,470
small or trivial ask and that it may

367
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,129
turn out not to be possible this is you

368
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,710
know can God make a

369
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,930
rock so heavy he can't lift it kind of

370
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,100
problem but I do think that it is

371
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,400
something that Apple should look into

372
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,530
I've also seen the the Apple products

373
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,910
have really moved away from jailbreaks

374
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,710
since I think the last untethered

375
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:04,250
jailbreak was like I don't know

376
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:07,430
iOS 9 something since they've moved away

377
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,970
from that what they have moved towards

378
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,970
is picking up old old copies of iCloud

379
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,600
backups so encrypting those would be a

380
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,070
really great idea by default and that

381
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,570
was the question of what governments can

382
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:26,000
do so very frequently one of the things

383
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:31,429
that I hear when something goes wrong is

384
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,720
there ought to be a law and as a member

385
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,320
of a digital civil liberties

386
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,630
organization I'm often skeptical of this

387
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,879
I don't usually think that we need a lot

388
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,950
of you laws what we really need is to

389
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,220
start enforcing some of the laws that we

390
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:50,510
already have this next bit of analysis

391
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,640
is us-based and this is because EF f is

392
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,310
a t-shirt and sticker organization with

393
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,560
a law firm attached and when all you

394
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,750
have is a hammer all your problems start

395
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,050
to look like nails and all I have is a

396
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:06,380
floor of angry us attack lawyers and so

397
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:10,340
all of my answers look a lot like legal

398
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,720
analysis for the US market so there are

399
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,730
some laws that are being broken

400
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,340
including the federal wiretapping Act

401
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:19,310
the stored Communications Act and the

402
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,770
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act one thing

403
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:23,060
that I want to make clear because I'm

404
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:27,260
not sure that there would be time to

405
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,659
discuss these things in detail is that

406
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:35,510
yeah if F frequently fights the misuse

407
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:38,480
of these laws code is speech and EFS

408
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,550
fought to make sure that code is

409
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,860
recognized as speech in the United

410
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,879
States and we are no less committed to

411
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,699
that position now then we were last week

412
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,550
or the week before code is still speech

413
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,600
I continue to defend the rights of

414
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,299
security researchers

415
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,100
and the rights of hackers I continue to

416
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:01,139
defend the right of people to tinker

417
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:07,678
with the things that they bought that

418
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:10,289
they own but you're right ends at a

419
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,740
certain point and that point is the

420
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:16,500
creation of malicious software that you

421
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,380
then sell specifically for the purpose

422
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:24,179
of breaking the wall that's really where

423
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,850
my sympathy kind of fizzles out as you

424
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:29,760
can see here one of the other things

425
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,620
that we can do is you can actually go

426
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,710
after the companies themselves

427
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,469
I believe the s Bev did the FTC the FTC

428
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,360
what after stealthGenie the cellphone

429
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,860
spying and monitoring app which is why

430
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,270
when you go to their page now you can

431
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,570
see that stuff genie is no longer

432
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,570
available

433
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,950
some courts have also held that the

434
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,570
makers of spyware installed on a

435
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,860
computer used to intercept electronic

436
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,020
communications and send them to the

437
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,639
company's server is itself guilty of the

438
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,379
interception under the federal

439
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,419
wiretapping Act even though it was an

440
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,070
end-user not the company itself that

441
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:08,190
installed the software we've also seen a

442
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,570
lot of successful prosecutions against

443
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,299
companies selling voice recorders

444
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,760
transmitters hidden in pens light bulbs

445
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,500
wall plugs and calculators but

446
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,919
prosecutions against purveyors of

447
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,140
spyware are pretty rare one spyware

448
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:27,210
software developer was indicted in 2005

449
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,760
but fled the country in 2014 stealth

450
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,179
genius CEO was indicted and pled guilty

451
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,039
and was fined $500,000 which you know

452
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:38,900
will put a down payment on a house in

453
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,190
San Francisco prosecutors have also

454
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,809
prosecuted the sorry prosecution's have

455
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,840
occurred with respect to end users of

456
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:48,658
spyware and the end user of a number of

457
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,970
spyware programs was indicted and pled

458
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,429
guilty in 2014 both interception of

459
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,559
electronic communications and possession

460
00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:05,490
of interception devices so do we involve

461
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:07,660
the FTC I at least in the case of this

462
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,270
2012 case in which the FTC

463
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,190
charged designer wear LLC a company that

464
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,950
provided spyware to rent to own computer

465
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,900
providers and entered into a consent

466
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,280
decree with the company agreeing not to

467
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,230
collect data from computers without

468
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,820
giving clear and prominent notice and

469
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:30,880
obtaining obtaining affirmative consent

470
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:32,860
similarly in 20 2008 the FTC sued cyber

471
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
spies software which sold a keylogger

472
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,300
program the company entered into a

473
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,820
consent decree with the FTC in 2010 in

474
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,500
which you agreed not to promote sell or

475
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,909
distribute software to be installed on

476
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:48,010
computers without the knowledge and

477
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:51,280
consent of the computers owner and

478
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,640
finally there are state laws various

479
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:59,430
states in the in the Union have

480
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:03,070
wiretapping statutes we have a we have

481
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,420
sorry two-party consent which means that

482
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,730
there are certain states in which if you

483
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,620
are having a conversation with someone

484
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:13,150
and you are recording it without their

485
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:16,899
consent it is a violation of their

486
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,640
rights and finally there's the in the

487
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,710
state of California there's the consumer

488
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,650
protection against computers spyware Act

489
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,730
so we get like extra extra super

490
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,710
specific there is also the matter of

491
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,630
whether or not it's okay to spy on your

492
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,980
children so a lot of these parental

493
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:38,470
tracking apps are extremely common as

494
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,450
spyware and a lot of the reason why

495
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,120
people say that they need this spyware

496
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,610
is because you know hey I I own this

497
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,389
phone and these are my kids and I should

498
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:52,959
be able to keep to keep track of them

499
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:57,540
but the right of a parent to spy on

500
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:02,250
their kid is not absolute it has limits

501
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:05,800
so a lot of states have this belief of

502
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,770
vicarious consent so parents can consent

503
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:12,730
on behalf of their children but this

504
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:16,270
this is a right that has limits for

505
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,010
example parents found that a parent in a

506
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,690
custody battle could serve to ously

507
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,970
record their child's phone conversations

508
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,950
with the other parent

509
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,110
where the parent was concerned about

510
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:31,110
abuse of a child so that's considered to

511
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:33,179
be okay but the parent has to

512
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,090
demonstrate a good faith objectively

513
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,800
reasonable basis for believing such

514
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,530
consent was necessary for the welfare of

515
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,060
the child so you can't just run around a

516
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,870
spying on your children willy-nilly and

517
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,870
having it be illegal

518
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,890
some states interpreting their own

519
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,450
wiretapping statutes have limited this

520
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,310
concept to situations where there is a

521
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,710
specific demonstration of a good faith

522
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,389
basis that is objectively reasonable for

523
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:05,370
believing that the minor child is being

524
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:07,470
abused so there are a lot of tools that

525
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,110
we could use there are plenty of tools

526
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,940
at our disposal there's a lot that the

527
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,649
ADA that the AV industry can do there's

528
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,090
a lot that individual security

529
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,000
researchers can do there is a lot that

530
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,919
governments can do we've seen that we

531
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,090
don't necessarily need new laws we just

532
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,460
need to use the ones that we already

533
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,970
have and the last point that I want to

534
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,780
make to you all is that I didn't invent

535
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,520
the terms stalker wear or spouse wear

536
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:36,510
the first reference that I was able to

537
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:39,570
find goes back to 2007 I people have

538
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,129
been doing this work for years and I

539
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,159
think it's extremely important to

540
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,670
acknowledge the contributions of people

541
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,830
like Harlow Holmes from the freedom of

542
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,300
press foundation who has been doing a

543
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,730
lot of this sort of on-the-ground work

544
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,720
for a very long time and also the

545
00:25:53,730 --> 00:26:00,240
journalists at vices motherboard who do

546
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,150
a series called when spies come home

547
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,920
that's done a lot to bring attention not

548
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,960
only to the spouse we're in stalker wear

549
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,260
industry but to the fact that the people

550
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,070
who make this to make their stop this

551
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,800
software aren't very good and so

552
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,710
frequently they end up having very

553
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,180
serious data breaches it's one of those

554
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,590
things that's really weird to complain

555
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,150
about because it feels like going into a

556
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,870
restaurant and saying this food isn't

557
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:30,210
very good and such small portions but in

558
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,870
this particular case not only is stalker

559
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,580
we're bad but also it you

560
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:40,040
can end up with these sort of like Exxon

561
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,490
Valdez oil spills of data going on and

562
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:47,309
so I think it's really important that

563
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:52,080
that we acknowledge Lorenzo and Joe and

564
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:53,610
Harlow and Thomas Brewster at Forbes and

565
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,970
all of the other people who came before

566
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:59,699
me and hope that we can all work

567
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,350
together in order to make it so that I

568
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:08,150
never have to give another talk on

569
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:08,149
spouse wear or stalker wear again that's
