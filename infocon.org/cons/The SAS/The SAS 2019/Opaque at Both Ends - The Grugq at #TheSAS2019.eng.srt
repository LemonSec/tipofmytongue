[Music]

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:10,860
I am gonna be talking about a PT's in

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,290
general but I'm actually speaking about

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,059
information warfare but not even about

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,009
information warfare in general I just

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,810
want to tell you why the Internet has

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,240
made information warfare different

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:28,278
that's it so pick up both ends how the

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,659
internet blew up information warfare and

10
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,239
this outline actually bears no

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,469
resemblance to the talk but this is what

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,328
you should take away anyway so the first

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,010
thing we need to know I was like when

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,059
you're doing information warfare what

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,070
you're actually doing is you're

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,760
attacking an information processing

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,500
system so you can attack a company or a

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,899
nation or a group or an individual you

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,969
you're going after basically the way

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,520
that something operates based on

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,109
information that it takes in so you want

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
to understand how the information gets

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,530
processed then how decisions are made

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,740
and then how that leads to action in

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,110
theory it's very very easy in practice

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,360
it's not unless you're going after the

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:21,990
Americans so all of this stuff has kind

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,110
of gotten easier with what the Russian

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,479
Federation in 2000 called the cyber

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,670
psychosocial environment which

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,740
apparently hasn't taken out as a term

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,840
after that we're gonna like pop into

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,710
what makes the internet really really

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,119
cool and then I'm gonna go into why and

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,589
then I'm gonna have the last word so

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
very quickly the reason that you should

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,140
listen to me is I've been doing this

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,090
forever I've been like speaking for 20

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,520
years doing research 20 years I've done

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:05,369
information warfare since maybe five

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,310
years ago bit less and I find it very

42
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,110
very interesting there's not quite a lot

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,729
of

44
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,840
opportunities for people to practice

45
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:18,400
information warfare freelance so I had

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,400
to go the other way I'm a thought leader

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,720
okay

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,309
so information warfare is very very

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,830
simple it's the exact same thing as

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,780
marketing essentially what you do is you

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,810
take your best message like the best

52
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,370
thing you could possibly say you take

53
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,280
the best channel that you can say it

54
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,280
over and then you hope that it works so

55
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,170
you hope for the best and that's

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,330
basically how everything has worked for

57
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,559
a very very long time and it gets you

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,730
things like this this is your classic

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,280
high prestige high prestige channel and

60
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,340
a very expensive watch like this is

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,260
straightforward how it all works and if

62
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,590
you take the same techniques and you use

63
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,600
them for information warfare purposes

64
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,209
you get stuff like this right the

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,680
Germans have landed in Canada you know

66
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,870
all these horrible things that the

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,880
Germans are doing so this is from World

68
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,870
War two when what the British were

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,720
trying to do is they're trying to

70
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,550
convince the Canadians to commit troops

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,410
and people and sort of join up and go

72
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,040
and fight the Germans because they were

73
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,320
trying to say the only thing that will

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,390
work is total victory like the Germans

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,420
are not going to stop once they take

76
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,980
over Europe like you're next so meet

77
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,018
them here otherwise you'll have to beat

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,640
them at home and to make sure that

79
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,040
people understood who it was coming from

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,630
they have this little none of these

81
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,549
things that's happened yet so this is

82
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,760
actually white propaganda it's actually

83
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,440
attributed and this sort of thing works

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,459
because we're all people and people have

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,400
been the same for a very very long time

86
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,870
the thing about people is that we

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,900
respond to pretty much the same things

88
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,620
and we always have and so if you know

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,820
how that works

90
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,380
you're good to go unfortunately when

91
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,220
you're doing black propaganda which is

92
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,799
when you are impersonating a member of

93
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,260
the group that you're attacking you

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,769
generally have this problem which is

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,719
called opaque at both ends so the

96
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,729
problem is the people that are receiving

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,020
the message

98
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,630
don't know where it comes from so it's

99
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,240
opaque and you as someone sending the

100
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,100
message don't know what happens so again

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,970
it's opaque so you end up sending

102
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,230
something they don't know where it's

103
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,940
from

104
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,400
you sort of hope for the best and you

105
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,010
don't know if they got it so you've got

106
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,460
this terrible problem which again it's

107
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,250
opaque at both ends so black goes to

108
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,919
black and the way that you beat that is

109
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,350
you have to have an evil genius and your

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,240
evil genius has to completely understand

111
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,640
the culture that you're targeting so

112
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,530
that they can tailor messages and they

113
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,070
can produce messaging that will resonate

114
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,169
with your target and in theory that

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,520
works because of all people and people

116
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,490
are basically people and it doesn't

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,229
really matter who they are or where they

118
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,630
are as long as you can get something

119
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,910
that resonates you'll be fine

120
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,370
the problem is you have to resonate with

121
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,790
the right group right if you if you

122
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:25,660
don't hit the right tribal group your

123
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:29,080
message fails and even though people are

124
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,400
people unless you make sure that the

125
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,590
right people are getting the right

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,500
message it's not gonna get you anywhere

127
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,080
so this is a North Korean classic

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:42,220
example you've got a nice divide you can

129
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,010
see it is two tribal groups but things

130
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,040
have changed these days it actually

131
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,860
doesn't matter which location you're in

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,130
like tribal groups are no longer created

133
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,290
by geography you're no longer in the

134
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,409
same tribal group as your neighbor

135
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,380
simply because they're your neighbor

136
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,860
right what we do instead is we find some

137
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,570
characteristic of our personhood your

138
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,090
job your interest your religion or

139
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,790
something like that and use that to

140
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,119
establish your tribal group so you take

141
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,510
a piece that you feel identifies you and

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,490
you join a group that also identifies

143
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,730
like that which is how we have things

144
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,030
like this like InfoSec where we all like

145
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,860
computer stuff and we're therefore

146
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,489
connected via that even though we don't

147
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,949
live in the same village

148
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,610
so it doesn't matter who your neighbors

149
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:42,490
are anymore you can be all alone and

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:44,449
still part of like the wider community I

151
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:50,840
don't really have much to say I just

152
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:52,430
think it's a really cool picture but

153
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,049
like we're gonna change gears slightly

154
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,639
and talk about so where does that get us

155
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,259
with Infowars so we know that there's

156
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,720
like tribal groups that their virtual

157
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,160
tribes based on ideology and that we

158
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,139
need to tailor a message that's going to

159
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,849
resonate with them and we want to

160
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,810
impersonate someone within that tribal

161
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:14,180
group and if you are completely shocked

162
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,430
by this you know welcome to 2016 and you

163
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,389
know this is a very very classic example

164
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:23,449
of info war is very very basic and it

165
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,190
turned out to work which by all rights

166
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:30,159
it shouldn't have given how terrible it

167
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:33,560
was it was made up mostly of bots and

168
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:36,050
the problem of course is that even

169
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,360
though it was done very very poorly it's

170
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,930
become what a lot of people view as the

171
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,699
state of the art so while it was very

172
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,370
very basic and sort of it hit the right

173
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,460
points it was not particularly creative

174
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,099
and really really cool like it's no

175
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,948
Sefton Delmer so everyone that's getting

176
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,080
ready to fight bots is getting ready to

177
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,449
fight the last war right like they're

178
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,349
all tooled up they're ready to go but

179
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:05,090
they're gonna really get it wrong

180
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,780
because there are literally doing things

181
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,570
like this alright this is how they are

182
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,690
training Cybercom to fight mimetic

183
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,389
warfare they have people in rooms

184
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:24,229
looking at memes taking notes sarcasm

185
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:27,740
good alright alright so that's not how

186
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:30,219
it works that's not a meme that's that's

187
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,390
you got it all wrong and the thing is

188
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:35,270
it's because they believe things like

189
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,479
this were memes and these are not means

190
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,870
these are not designed to be shown to

191
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,440
people outside of your tribal group the

192
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,410
is our propaganda posters right it's

193
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,430
literally the same thing right join us

194
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,319
and help we can do it you know it's just

195
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,209
straightforward propaganda it's it's

196
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,089
speaking to your tribal group and trying

197
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,580
to get them to come together and do a

198
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:04,990
thing that you want them to do which is

199
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:08,140
cool but it's not actually infowar so

200
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,730
what you you end up with is you don't

201
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,380
really know what you're doing so you try

202
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,750
and copy it and you end up with a very

203
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,910
poor copy and if you don't know what's

204
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,890
actually going on you're going to make

205
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,719
something that looks like it's right and

206
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,610
it should be right but it's really not

207
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,540
and that's because fundamentally

208
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,000
information war in cyber war is

209
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,620
Calvinball like it's not supposed to

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,610
make sense the rules are not the same

211
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,870
all the time they change constantly and

212
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,589
you can make them change if you want to

213
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,430
all right and if you don't do that

214
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,020
you're going to think that you've done

215
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,260
the best thing you possibly can and

216
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:51,130
you're going to get blindsided by a bear

217
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:54,069
for yeah no real reason but so that is

218
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,860
like cyber war in a nutshell like

219
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,410
there's all this info war and stuff but

220
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,800
why did the Internet make information

221
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:07,839
warfare different because of Randy

222
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,990
Savage obviously the the really really

223
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,650
simple thing is remember when I said

224
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,110
that black propaganda was opaque at both

225
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,880
ends the sender doesn't know if it works

226
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,140
and the receiver doesn't know where it

227
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,300
comes from that's no longer true now

228
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,810
it's only opaque at one end and the

229
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,520
other end has complete transparency and

230
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,569
they have complete transparency because

231
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,430
the internet gives them special

232
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,350
capabilities for instance feedback loops

233
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,880
feedback loops are like the one thing

234
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,770
that you need to focus on if you want to

235
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,959
do better at whatever you're doing so if

236
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,600
you tighten your feedback loop you will

237
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,459
improve dramatically during World War 2

238
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,640
the feedback loops they were called

239
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,770
comebacks and you'd basically get it by

240
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,699
capturing prisoners of war and then

241
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,870
overhearing them in the cages where they

242
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,560
were and you would see if they were

243
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,180
talking about your propaganda campaign

244
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,199
so that's a very very weak way of

245
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:11,800
getting feedback on your campaign and it

246
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,190
would take if you're lucky one month two

247
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,020
months more realistically or take six to

248
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,280
eight months and you would never get it

249
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,470
like that's most of what happened so

250
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,089
what we have with the internet now is we

251
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,500
actually have the ability to do like

252
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,210
engagement metrics we can see if people

253
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,410
like what we're doing you can see if

254
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,210
people click on what we're doing we can

255
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,360
see like what is actually happening and

256
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,430
we can see this propaganda campaign is

257
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,510
working and this one is not let's ditch

258
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:43,000
this one and double down over here the

259
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,710
other thing we can do is we've got huge

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,320
amounts of data on people so we don't

261
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,650
need someone who has grown up in the

262
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,120
target environment and knows them really

263
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,540
really well we just need a lot of data

264
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,820
about the target environment for example

265
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,099
if you were China you have a huge amount

266
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,140
of data on your target environment

267
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,410
because you've hacked OPM you've hacked

268
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,240
all the hotels you've hacked you know

269
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,949
all the airlines you have massive

270
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,660
amounts of information and data and you

271
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,970
could just mined that and that will

272
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,829
allow you to understand who you're

273
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,380
actually going for you can you can

274
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,270
create small targeted tight groups and

275
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,600
you can do that just because you've got

276
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,010
huge amounts of data and then the other

277
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,680
thing that the internet lets you do is

278
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,620
other than having very very tight

279
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,689
feedback loops and being able to tailor

280
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,680
your message to your actual group you

281
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,640
can deliver it directly to them so

282
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,520
historically when you're doing like a

283
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,410
radio broadcast or TV broadcast you're

284
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,699
dropping leaflets you've got to go

285
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,829
fairly broad right you don't know

286
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,980
exactly who's gonna get it if they're

287
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,510
gonna get it like I don't have time for

288
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,630
it but there's great anecdotes about

289
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,069
like it took months for the British to

290
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,560
realize that they were sending over a

291
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,480
frequency that got bounced off the earth

292
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,119
before it reached Norway so they were

293
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,400
trying to hit Norway with radio and it

294
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,730
wasn't working because they got like the

295
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,350
waves so it

296
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,760
like skipped straight over Norway and

297
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,050
like landed some warehouse so you know

298
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,490
you're not gonna have that anymore you

299
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,500
can literally deliver it to exactly who

300
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,149
you want and then if you've got

301
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,040
computers so everything's like fast and

302
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:21,709
free and flexible whatever the thing is

303
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,329
that these are not like people will come

304
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,149
out and say things are different because

305
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:29,209
computers and that's not true what

306
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:32,269
computers give you is nothing that a

307
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:35,000
nation-state needs right nation states

308
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,459
are not cost sensitive nation states are

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,860
not inhibited by like not having enough

310
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,380
people to throw at a problem they're not

311
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,600
inhibited by speed at the implementation

312
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,449
and they're inhibited by their

313
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,250
bureaucracies so even though they could

314
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,510
implement something fairly quickly it

315
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,800
might take two months to do all the

316
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,600
meetings before they can agree to

317
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,000
actually do the attack so relatively

318
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,070
speaking I have a lot of slides on this

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,769
but relatively speaking feedback is a

320
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,320
big one like that's your big wing

321
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:08,060
feedback is what lets you say this is

322
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,360
doing well or this is doing poorly and

323
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,300
because you can do that without actually

324
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,589
speaking to anyone or knowing anything

325
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,660
you don't actually need to know much

326
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,670
about your targets right you could just

327
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,370
a be test your way to a disinfo campaign

328
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,360
data science allows you to tailor

329
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,040
delivery allows you to hit it to the

330
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,310
people that you've tailored it for but

331
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,579
they're useless without each other and

332
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,219
yeah that's kind of rubbish so as I was

333
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,459
saying feedback is your big win like you

334
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,529
get immediate info on how you're doing

335
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,529
is this going well is this going poorly

336
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,790
tailoring is good you can get the people

337
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,939
that you actually want to receive your

338
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,579
message to be clustered into the right

339
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,000
groups and then you can target them with

340
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:01,370
specific delivery and all of that gets

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,750
it to the point where you don't actually

342
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,019
need geniuses anymore

343
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,790
you can do with anyone you just need

344
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,610
someone who can read a pie chart and you

345
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,130
go okay let's do this one more because

346
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,310
it's bigger that's it

347
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,620
so you save on in

348
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,540
but more specifically you don't have to

349
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,439
find the right people you just need to

350
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,889
find anyone and if you have them you can

351
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:29,990
make them do you can make them competent

352
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,540
enough to lead your target audience

353
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,759
anywhere you want because you can just a

354
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,809
be test you can get feedback you can

355
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,189
make sure that you're hitting the right

356
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:43,430
target audience and so on so this is

357
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:46,639
what you get these days you don't need a

358
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,449
genius if on the other hand you try and

359
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:54,649
do all of this without a genius you end

360
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,479
up with this which is a leaflet that the

361
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,569
US Army may hate during the Vietnam War

362
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,910
and they were dropping it on North

363
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:06,349
Vietnam and it says don't deny yourself

364
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,699
the right to be a man and to Americans

365
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,290
they were like this will make them miss

366
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,719
their wives and girlfriends and they'll

367
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,969
want to go home and to the North

368
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,129
Vietnamese this was our daughters are

369
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,050
being corrupted by Americans and being

370
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,720
forced into sex work we have to get rid

371
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,969
of them so it turned out that because

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,670
they didn't have feedback they were

373
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,160
dropping propaganda on the enemy that

374
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,500
made the enemy hate them even more so

375
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,709
you need feedback otherwise you think

376
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,490
that everyone's an American where is

377
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:39,829
that gonna take us well I think the

378
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,209
cyber things going to catch on it's

379
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,790
probably going to be very useful going

380
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:46,638
forward I suspect that the ability to

381
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,769
send information to people that you want

382
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,829
to read information and be able to

383
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:53,839
adjust their processing and change how

384
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,000
they think about things that's gonna be

385
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,579
an important capability and you want to

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,279
get on that and the good news is you can

387
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:05,688
do that as long as you invest in very

388
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,280
very basic stuff the other thing is

389
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,270
people have been freaking out about this

390
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,158
forever right like this is nothing new

391
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:17,389
it's not really that scary and you know

392
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,220
we'll figure it out like it's not gonna

393
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,860
be the end of the world it never is

394
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:26,899
and before I go I'm gonna leave you with

395
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,879
the most awesome thing I actually have a

396
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:31,330
copy

397
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:35,760
of Russia's secret tradecraft manual for

398
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:40,330
this information and you can get it to

399
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,600
99 cents on Amazon and that's literally

400
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,649
all you need you have this you've got

401
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,399
everything that they did

402
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,400
you're good so thank you that's it
