1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,559
what I'm going to give is just an

2
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,580
overview

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,020
of the electrical engineering computer

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,820
science department and then I'll give an

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,440
overview of ACI and then I'm going to

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,260
talk a little bit about how do we how do

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,000
you come back here how do you come get

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
this as an assignment so

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,599
um

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
first of all a change that happened last

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
year is kind of probably transparent to

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,719
the cadets here in most people but uh

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,760
ACI used to be a direct report to the

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,500
suit but now we fall under eeks so

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,879
that's why I'm kind of talking on behalf

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,040
of both I happen to have experience

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,960
because I did teach in eeks before and I

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,539
was the ex faculty recruiter I actually

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,300
recruited Colonel Arnold I think a long

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,440
time ago for his first tour in in eeks

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,699
back in the day so I've I've been around

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,879
this process for for a little while

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,280
all right so I'll give you an overview

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,500
at eeks as I said over ACI and then how

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,060
you become part of our team

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,760
all right so the eek's mission is uh to

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,920
educate and train the core of cadets

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,619
uh to inspire leaders of character and

29
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,939
lifelong Learners who think critically

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,799
innovate apply Computing and Engineering

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,979
expertise as officers so as the talks

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,900
have all talked about today you know

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,640
getting to your unit being Innovative

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
using the new equipment as we talked

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,000
about ew equipment all of those things

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
finding things that are wrong fixing

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,320
them and and making the Army better we

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,799
we hope to to do that in in uh in eeks

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,600
and and obviously we have people that

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,820
graduate from each department electrical

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,020
engineering computer science cyber

42
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,299
science are the three majors and go into

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,860
other branches which is great because

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,799
they can spread the good word about

45
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,140
those Technologies

46
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,659
so what does it actually mean though

47
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,259
um

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,020
if you apply to come back here as a

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,720
rotating Junior rotating faculty you

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,240
will be teaching the the West Point

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,960
Cadets know Cy 105 that'll be like the

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,219
first thing you do you actually you'll

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,038
go to a summer program called fdw

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,560
faculty development Workshop which you

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,140
you're you're taught how to teach so um

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,180
kind of a train the trainer thing kind

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,800
of how the classrooms are set up what

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,540
what are your expectations how you use

59
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,459
Academy management system that this the

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,379
the opposite version of CIS that the

61
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
faculty use so you'll learn those kinds

62
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,360
of things and then

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,080
um

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,140
uh after that summer you'll teach the

65
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,300
the core class that every Cadet teacher

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,260
takes which is uh Cy 105. now um before

67
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,819
I go any further I do want to make

68
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,379
something really clear I think that

69
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,420
there's a myth that I've heard in my 24

70
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,700
years of the army that every once in a

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,019
while every couple years I'll hear this

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,580
thing of oh do you have to be a West

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,739
pointer to go teach at West Point it's

74
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,080
it's not true at all like go back to

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,300
your ROTC units and tell them if you

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,640
aspire to teach at West Point ROTC can

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,260
come and teach West Point OCS can come

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,700
and teach at West Point in fact we look

79
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,319
to have a little bit of diversity of

80
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,140
instructors so a sergeant major and the

81
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,519
Army can come and teach at West Point

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
sergeant major Draeger she teaches one

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,940
of our 400 level cyber courses so we've

84
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,379
actually had a staff sergeant from the

85
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,840
band uh teaching in the computer science

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,879
department because he had a as long as

87
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,260
you have a master's in computer science

88
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,480
or related discipline then then that's

89
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,060
an option so we definitely bring that

90
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,980
back of Warrant officers have we had a

91
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,420
warrant officer teach

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,360
oh we got to get on that okay

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,519
I I we may have and I just don't know

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,260
about it I don't know I I can't think of

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,599
one in my head but I I'll get Chief to

96
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,920
teach a class next semester and then we

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,920
can check that blog so um

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,519
so yeah we've we uh you can be like I

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,420
said you can come from a different

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,560
commissioning Source income here so

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
please spread that word out there the

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,580
myth it never existed it's never existed

103
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,019
that that we only have West pointers

104
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,220
come back to teach West Point that would

105
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,560
be kind of strange so uh just remember

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,080
that all right so uh how the

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,599
Department's organized uh just briefly

108
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,760
um as I said we Army cyber Institute now

109
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,040
falls under um the East department so my

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,260
boss is now Colonel uh raftery uh the

111
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,000
department of reeks there's the deputy

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,680
department head there is a thing my

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
Cadets were asking about and some of the

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,860
cadets here may Wonder

115
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,519
um

116
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,840
uh

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,660
the there's there's kind of like just

118
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,100
you understand the senior officer

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,440
positions at West Point there's actually

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,699
um some interesting things that happen

121
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,000
so I'm a cyber officer but my functional

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
area is 47 Victor which means I'm a army

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
cyber Institute Academy Professor it's

124
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,500
very specific there's five of us in the

125
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,180
Army right now

126
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,840
um so uh

127
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,280
once once you apply to become an academy

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
Professor that means these are

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,460
professors who will stay here until they

130
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,080
retire this is the last job I'll have in

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,540
the Army maybe not last well this is my

132
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,800
last job but it doesn't have to be the

133
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
last job but but this is your last post

134
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,280
you're not going to leave West Point

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
um so that's that's an option

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,180
um when you get to the next level of

137
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,520
that is is these two people so Colonel

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,620
chuar and Colonel raftery

139
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,180
um they're even a little more special

140
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,979
because they actually change their basic

141
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,520
Branch to pusma which is a um a

142
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,160
professor United States Military Academy

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,780
which means that

144
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,639
um

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,400
when you're the deputy you you once the

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,139
re that once the head retires you become

147
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,479
the head when when you retire as the

148
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,759
head of a department you actually pin on

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,860
one star so you retire as a brigadier

150
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,100
general and then um but you're only one

151
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,259
star for a day so because of that you

152
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,419
don't get the retirement pay of a

153
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,160
regular General you just get the honors

154
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,100
of being a retired General so that being

155
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
said Colonel raftery is also an ROTC

156
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,180
graduate so

157
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,520
um an RTC graduate will when he retires

158
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,039
next summer he will he will retire at

159
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
West Point as Brigadier General referee

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
okay

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,620
um so uh oh I'll go back I think uh I

162
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,139
just wanted to basically show how we

163
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,280
have

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,320
um in our teaching program we have the

165
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,259
core which this is our all the classes

166
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,300
that we teach that are mandatory for all

167
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,100
the cadets so Cy 105 Cy 305 and I think

168
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,039
there's the core classes fall under that

169
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
there's the computer science which is

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,639
the computer science major so so Colonel

171
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,680
Harrison he's the other half of Colonel

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,780
Arnold who created the Cyber Branch

173
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,060
Insignia so they were the ones drawing

174
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,699
that out years ago that were you'll all

175
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,919
wear later

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,539
we've just stood this major up to cyber

177
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,560
science so we have a cyber science

178
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,460
program we sunsetted our I.T program and

179
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,259
then created the the Cyber science

180
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,180
program so you can get a cyber science

181
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,840
degree a bet accreditation

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,639
of that degree is forthcoming and it's

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
not here yet but it will be an Abed

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,020
accredited degree once we graduate

185
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,440
enough in that major

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
and then finally electrical engineering

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,979
in Colonel Blaine is there we also have

188
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,720
these research centers these may

189
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,699
possibly change they evolve over time

190
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,020
but we have a cyber Research Center

191
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,259
focused on Cyber research for Cadets we

192
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,199
have a photonics research center and a

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,600
robotics Research Center as well

194
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
now

195
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,380
um what that means is and and I'll get

196
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,780
into this when I get to ACI but as an

197
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,819
instructor I said you'll teach 105 the

198
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,340
first year you'll probably just teach Cy

199
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,199
105 learn how to teach and get good at

200
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,180
it then you could possibly Branch into

201
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,479
whatever your your specialty is or teach

202
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,000
a class that's interesting to you within

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
within your field but there's also some

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,160
side things you'll do like um

205
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm in charge of the ham radio club I'm

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,560
assistant OIC of the uh

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
chemical engineering club as well so

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
there's also the the cadet sports teams

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
the club teams and then the actual teams

210
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,419
like or the the NCAA teams and the core

211
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,759
Squad teams you could be an officer

212
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
representative for that so there's a lot

213
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,880
of other things that you can do outside

214
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,639
of the classroom to support the core so

215
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,840
that those are things that you could do

216
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,479
as an instructor you also there's

217
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,759
there's uh there's five pillars I won't

218
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,860
get into the the details of that right

219
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,139
now but there's um

220
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,300
there are opportunities in these centers

221
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,220
those are these opportunities for you to

222
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,199
um this is there it is here to do uh

223
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,879
research in in your field as well now

224
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,440
you will be teaching a full load so

225
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,819
you'll you won't get to do a lot of

226
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,319
research unless you do it on your own

227
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,780
time but you can do some research while

228
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,259
you're here all right so oh now I went

229
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,958
yeah there we go so what does it look

230
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,299
like right now about 120 plus staff and

231
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,059
faculty we have an NSA fellow

232
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
um kind of an interesting note

233
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,580
um

234
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,380
I can't think of his name right now the

235
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,160
the old direct deputy director of NSA

236
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,240
um Chris English he back in the late and

237
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,820
early 90s was actually in each

238
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,860
department as one of the NSA fellows so

239
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,240
I always tell the NSA fellow I was like

240
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
you got big shoes to fill you have to be

241
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
deputy director of NSA someday or he's

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
the Cyber Czar for the uh now for for

243
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,360
the president so

244
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,279
um pretty interesting we have one

245
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,839
Lincoln Labs fellow right now this this

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
can continue can change as I said

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,100
there's uh the four teaching programs

248
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,600
core computer science cyber science

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,160
electrical engineering our three

250
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,040
research centers and then now RB cyber

251
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,019
Institute falls under and I'll get in uh

252
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,080
to the four areas we work in next all

253
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,360
right so Army cyber Institute where I

254
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,980
work right now

255
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,000
um

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
you saw a lot of the low level the

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
platoon litter the Brigade Division if

258
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,360
you go all the way up on the other end

259
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,620
of the scale you get to the highest

260
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,600
level of how cyber is laid out right now

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,380
so if we look at it we have

262
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,920
um

263
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,580
the headquarters dhg6 so this is the the

264
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,019
kind of the more the signal side of the

265
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,180
house resource and policy headquarters

266
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,160
dig 357 uh uh D.A management offices so

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,600
is demo so it used to be demo Cy cyber

268
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,459
now as demo strategic operations but

269
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,860
there's there's also a demo SOC which is

270
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,220
strategic operations uh specific cyber

271
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,500
so um and that's that's where the plans

272
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,080
and policies come up come about

273
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,720
um what is I just realized what's not

274
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,459
listed okay

275
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,579
um

276
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,800
the there's also one other this is in

277
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
the Pentagon both of these are in the

278
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
Pentagon there's also one other piece

279
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,140
here it's it's not Army command but it's

280
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,540
the civilian side it's rather new you

281
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,820
might hear called the principal cyber

282
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,640
advisor for the Army so Dr Sula Meyer

283
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,160
who sergeant major and I just met with

284
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,519
last week uh down at the Pentagon uh he

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,260
does more the civilian advisement side

286
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,019
of that and uh and so that's another

287
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,620
piece that that in ACI we focus on that

288
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,480
as well because we basically have to

289
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,000
answer to like four different people so

290
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,100
uh Army cyber command uh as we talked

291
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,019
about said this is General Barrett and

292
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,279
then uh cyber Center of Excellence

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,140
you've got a full dose of that with with

294
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,000
uh General vial and general Stanton so

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,620
General Stanton is this two star right

296
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,839
here and then we have where I'm at over

297
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,540
here Army cyber Institute so we are

298
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,220
providing kind of General support of

299
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,740
cyber across the Army but with research

300
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,680
and forward-looking things the way I

301
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,140
like to think of it and and I think JC

302
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,300
Fernandez here major Fernandez and I

303
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,279
have talked about this a lot of like

304
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,620
when you're in the fight you sometimes

305
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,720
see problems and you're like

306
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,899
ah I know how to fix that but I don't

307
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,440
have six months to go do that and and

308
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,320
that is what I kind of I see as the as

309
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,480
the junior rotating people coming into

310
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,360
ACI is you've seen some problems in the

311
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,100
fight but you don't have time to really

312
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,920
solve them but ACI we're not operational

313
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,019
we're not in the fight we're not doing

314
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,300
cyber operations we're stepping back one

315
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,760
and saying okay what is what is the six

316
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,500
month what's the two-year what what

317
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
where are we going to be in cyber what

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
are things that we could fix to make it

319
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,440
better for the Cyber operators today

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,180
um and and that spans across the

321
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,600
education all the way to operations so

322
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
uh

323
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,160
so yeah let's uh go to the next one so

324
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,079
here's our vision a premier Institute

325
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,480
that expands our knowledge of cyber

326
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,160
competition to prevent strategic

327
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,980
surprise I I am actually going to be

328
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,300
doing an offside and we're going to be

329
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,120
potentially shifting this a little bit

330
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,500
but really what like I said we're going

331
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,720
to be focusing on

332
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,260
um

333
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,200
longer term problems across the Army and

334
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
and all all aspects of cyber

335
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,339
okay

336
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,940
uh how we're broken down as I showed the

337
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,399
the different pieces of eeks right now

338
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,399
in in this I feel like cyber is such a

339
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,380
dynamic environment I'm showing you this

340
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,940
as today

341
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,440
um if this summer we could possibly

342
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
change this it's it's definitely always

343
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,060
up for debate we try not to change too

344
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,220
much but we have to adapt to the Army we

345
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,779
have to adapt to the needs that we see

346
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,860
so right now the way we kind of have our

347
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,420
expertise aligned and the way we're

348
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,459
seeing cyber in the Army as we have the

349
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,019
information Warfare side and that's the

350
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,139
side that is in direct alignment support

351
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,360
with the information advantage and all

352
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,000
of all of that aspect of cyber

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,180
um you know we oftentimes I oftentimes

354
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,100
as a computer scientist you know think

355
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,779
about okay disabling the machine getting

356
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,459
remote access setting an implant like

357
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,040
those kinds of tactical operations well

358
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,899
what does that all mean if the other

359
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,519
person isn't using that computer like

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,320
there's there's a human aspect side of

361
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
things and I think we're seeing we see a

362
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,620
ton of that with Ukraine and Russia

363
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,880
right now there's just a ton of

364
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,660
misinformation information

365
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,420
disinformation and and these influence

366
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,000
operations you can hack people without

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,339
having to get uh without having to to

368
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,980
send a spam email and implanting a

369
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,240
computer you could just implant their

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,579
mind right so thinking of things in that

371
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,279
terms it's this other side of cyber

372
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,920
um that that is I all of you have seen

373
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,560
it I'm sure you've all had different

374
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,480
aspects and things and I mean now

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,519
it's not like 10 years ago when you

376
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,660
would Google something you just get a

377
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,279
search result you're getting a curated

378
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,320
Google list of based off of your search

379
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
history and all of those things so in a

380
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
sense you're kind of being programmed by

381
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,180
by all these algorithms and that's the

382
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,620
research areas that that our information

383
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,300
Warfare looks at

384
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,220
our core team you've probably had time

385
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,839
to talk to here today they're the ones

386
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,459
who ran this event so thank you again

387
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,459
core team cyber operations research and

388
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,500
engineering

389
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,920
and they've done more of the Hands-On

390
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
piece more of the physical systems piece

391
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,060
looking at creating threat emitters

392
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,279
there's a we have our we have a cheap

393
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,519
price here Captain schmel doing full

394
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,680
force on looking at the future of ew

395
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,199
systems as we as we have been told here

396
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,360
we don't have programs of record that

397
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,699
are out there yet TLS is on on the

398
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,339
horizon terrestrial layer system but

399
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,600
it's not out yet and there's still

400
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,279
debate as to what that even looks like I

401
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,860
think Lockheed just won the contract but

402
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,839
in the meantime there's there's uh if

403
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,079
anybody here play with an RTL SDR

404
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
okay a few people one person

405
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,339
that's our ham radio operator over there

406
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,100
right yeah so get your hem license I'm

407
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,899
gonna I'm the ham radio operator so I

408
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,300
can I can make my own pitch on this one

409
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,040
um if you're interested in ew if you

410
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
want to learn more about it you could be

411
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,180
a fake electrical engineer like I am I'm

412
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,980
a computer scientist but I I play

413
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,720
electrical engineer when I when I when I

414
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,820
get in the ham radio club room

415
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,100
um it is a great hobby there's Direction

416
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,600
finding there's literally all of the

417
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,100
interesting aspects and kind of the

418
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,639
technical aspects of ew is is in the ham

419
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,639
radio

420
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,360
realm you can you know

421
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,680
I think

422
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
I've kind of seen it evolve over time

423
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,899
but without the internet and without

424
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,000
cell phones ham radio was like how we

425
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,440
talk to people long distance without

426
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,199
using you know long distance corded

427
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,420
phone companies and um in fact I was

428
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,120
just talking uh this morning with uh

429
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,940
with uh Mr Monaco here which was uh he

430
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,500
used the Mars station when he was a

431
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,360
Cadet to talk back

432
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,399
um to talk back home because that was

433
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,680
one way of doing uh long distance and

434
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,260
that was that was common back then which

435
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,540
is a completely mind-bending thing when

436
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,880
you think you're transmitting a signal

437
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
it's bouncing off the ionosphere and

438
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,139
then reaching a far distance so if

439
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:22,920
you're interested in that then

440
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,139
definitely want to get your ham license

441
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,240
as Chief just got his so congratulations

442
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,560
to Chief price uh all right and um and

443
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,240
then clone code detection is they're

444
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,639
doing a um really interestingly and I

445
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,959
just saw the purchase order so we're

446
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
about to buy a whole bunch of internet

447
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,360
routers the the common routers that that

448
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,820
uh that households will by

449
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
and uh we're going to be pulling all the

450
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,240
firmware off of them and doing some

451
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,500
analysis so if you're interested in that

452
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,180
kind of stuff that's what that's the

453
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,220
kind of things this thing this team does

454
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,019
all right we have a law and policy team

455
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,060
and so that goes it back to and I know

456
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,260
so Liam's here he was on the uh the

457
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,380
cyber policy team which was a phenomenal

458
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,939
I got a chance to go out with them to

459
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,220
some great places and listen to him

460
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,480
really think through with the Strategic

461
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,059
side how how you can respond to events

462
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,599
in uh in cyber with policy and it's a

463
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
it's a critical piece that we have to

464
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,619
figure out because we could have all the

465
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,179
technology in the world but if we have

466
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,919
no policy to figure out how to employ it

467
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,220
then we're host so I it was super super

468
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,720
eye-opening when I got a chance to

469
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,220
listen to his team come up with some

470
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,400
really excellent responses to to crises

471
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
I think that were you at the your

472
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
Australia and France I think are the two

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
places we went it was fantastic

474
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,919
but really really eye-opening I think

475
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,600
the eye-opening thing for Australia was

476
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,299
they're kind of hosed right so actually

477
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,919
since then they've Rewritten their cyber

478
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,480
policy like their their structure but

479
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,760
the the funny thing is that I'll never

480
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,460
forget about that was after our team

481
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,419
went the the judges were like the

482
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,880
Australian judges were like wow I wish

483
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,440
you could pitch this to some of our

484
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
government administrators because they

485
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,740
don't understand how hosed we are like

486
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,679
it was really really eye-opening

487
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
um so law and policy we currently have a

488
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,780
um one of our Academy professors is a

489
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,120
Jag lawyer who who looks at the law and

490
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,440
policy side and we actually run a

491
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,100
program in ACI to educate lawyers who

492
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,200
are going to be going to cyber units so

493
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,299
if you think about that a lawyer is

494
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,340
trained as a as a lawyer to be a lawyer

495
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,200
when they come to a cyber unit how do

496
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
they handle that and that's a whole

497
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,980
other aspect of of things we have to

498
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,400
figure out so we we run this cyber

499
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
operations technical foundations course

500
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,860
for those for those Jag attorneys who

501
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,299
are going to be going and having to deal

502
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,820
with

503
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,220
deal with law at that at like cybercom

504
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,080
and our cyber so hopefully the one the

505
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,820
lawyers you deal with will have gone

506
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,900
through that course or at least have

507
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,940
some background in that and then lastly

508
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,620
we have our data and decision science

509
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,220
team so um

510
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,020
as as we've seen the secretary of the

511
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,940
Army's second priority is to make the

512
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,559
Army data Centric

513
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
what does that mean I mean it it sounds

514
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,419
awesome but implementing that and

515
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,039
figuring what out what that means is

516
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,740
really really challenging so this team

517
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,620
actually has some a lot of Hands-On

518
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,299
we're doing we have like I don't know

519
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,980
what kind of gpus I don't have that

520
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,600
anybody from that team here I don't

521
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,880
think but they got these Lambda servers

522
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,440
they got multiple servers they got a

523
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,500
whole Lab Set up training models doing

524
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,020
that machine learning that chat GPT type

525
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,280
stuff like that's the kind of things

526
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,020
that they're that they're working on and

527
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,179
working on it with like network data and

528
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,700
understanding can you can you just find

529
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,380
that needle in the haystack of attacks

530
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,640
that are happening on a network just by

531
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,280
looking at that data so that's what that

532
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,039
team does all right so

533
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,080
uh so as you um I I gave you two

534
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,419
completely different sides of of how you

535
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,440
could come here if you're really

536
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
interested in teaching Cadets and and

537
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,539
and and you you enjoy that then eeks is

538
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,760
where you would want to apply to if

539
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,380
you're interested in doing one of those

540
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,140
four areas or any area of within cyber

541
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,900
research then then ACI is where you'd

542
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,160
want to go

543
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,919
um you can teach from ACI as an academy

544
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,140
Professor I actually teach a cloud

545
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,880
computing course I got I've been here

546
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,919
you took my class you give me a thumbs

547
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,960
up maybe I did good I don't know

548
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,820
um so uh we uh uh we do I we do do some

549
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,380
teaching some of our rotators do teach

550
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,179
but in general the majority of their

551
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,780
time is spent researching uh if you

552
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,700
um so

553
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,799
uh

554
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,500
what I'll say now is the the great part

555
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,320
is the application process for both are

556
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,059
pretty much in the same they're in the

557
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,400
same portal so you can apply to both as

558
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,100
I said you could be ROTC I I would I

559
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,960
would just say start thinking about this

560
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,799
now and the reason why I say that is um

561
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,240
in

562
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,600
I I want to say

563
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,740
gosh 2004 I was in Iraq

564
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,740
I I came back and I was burnt out of the

565
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,539
army I was burnt out of of being

566
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,400
deployed for a year

567
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,980
and I was like you know I I think I'm

568
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,740
good I I think I did my my time and and

569
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,900
I was getting I was getting out and and

570
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,080
I got this email from

571
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,940
um from actually Colonel Estes for those

572
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,799
who knew her when she was here she just

573
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,919
retired uh she she was a captain and she

574
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,840
said you know apply to teaching Deeks

575
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,580
I'm like there's no way they would take

576
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,980
me not a chance so anybody who thinks

577
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,360
there's not a chance there's still a

578
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,280
chance I was just like I was kind of

579
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,200
middle of the road I just graduated I

580
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,539
was happy I'm happy with my my computer

581
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,100
science degree and I'm ready to get out

582
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,440
of the army so I did apply anyways I was

583
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,700
just like well it's kind of a crap shoot

584
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,280
so I come back from Iraq in a few months

585
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,900
later I get a call from her saying

586
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,460
congratulations you've been accepted to

587
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,620
come back and teach at West Point

588
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,500
and um I didn't even know what all of

589
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,820
this meant like I was talking to my wife

590
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,320
was like what what happened like I'm

591
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,799
planning on getting out so

592
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,000
uh here I am 25 years 20 yeah I'll be 25

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,980
years this summer uh still in the Army

594
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,780
so my Five-Year Plan turned out to be a

595
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,320
little bit longer so uh

596
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
I I think what what it did for me

597
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,059
professionally and personally is my I

598
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,580
had young children at the time but what

599
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,340
you get to do when we select you is we

600
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,580
do a by name request to HRC to say send

601
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,700
this person to grad school so uh once

602
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,980
that goes through you go to grad school

603
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,559
the cool thing is you are paid as a

604
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,740
captain Captain's pay to go and they pay

605
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,960
for the school to go to school so that's

606
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
your full-time job so you get a chance

607
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,640
to really break away from the Army and

608
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,100
say okay take you take a knee

609
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,260
it's not taking any in academics because

610
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,960
that first semester was going back to

611
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
school after not being in school is a

612
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
gear shift that you have to the context

613
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,240
switch or whatever you want to call it

614
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
but it is it can be rough

615
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,740
um but once you get in the groove of

616
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,780
things you you can make it through

617
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,440
um but after that I came here and taught

618
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,780
and it was just an amazing experience it

619
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,000
was just really really fun to work with

620
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,299
Cadets figure out you know figure out

621
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,340
how how Cadets learn how people think

622
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,440
about things how to communicate I got

623
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,299
much better at briefing all of these

624
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,220
things like happened and I was just like

625
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,980
this was just great and uh so then I was

626
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,500
planning on

627
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,240
uh I was actually planning on uh I

628
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,679
didn't know what to do after that I had

629
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,299
no idea I ended up going to cybercom

630
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,580
because uh General Alexander wanted all

631
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,320
of all the computer scientists to go to

632
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,179
cybercom so that's what happened and

633
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,440
then I applied to come back because I

634
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,299
loved it so much so

635
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,100
um I'm I'm just a huge fan of this

636
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,659
process I'm a huge fan of kind of where

637
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,100
it hits you in your career because you

638
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,380
can get burned out you know after four

639
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,780
years in the Army charging hard working

640
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,480
many hours taking a little bit of a

641
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,740
break and being able to set your own

642
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,840
schedule and and going to grad school is

643
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,520
it may be the break you need and I've

644
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,559
talked to him as I was a recruiter I

645
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,299
talked many people off the ledge of like

646
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,620
saying hey

647
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,120
um you know I know you're frustrated

648
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
right now you're probably frustrated

649
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,539
command whatever it may be but once you

650
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,039
go to grad school it'll be a reset and

651
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,480
then you can go back out to the force

652
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,640
refresh so I think that that process

653
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,100
does that really well so what you'll do

654
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,220
mechanically here is you'll go to

655
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,120
teach.westmont.edu you can actually

656
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,159
start this now so if you're even halfway

657
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
interested you can start it now and what

658
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,039
that does is it just helps us look

659
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,360
forward of saying okay we've got some

660
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,280
packets in the pipeline we probably

661
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,380
won't contact you until the time comes

662
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,720
of when it when it makes sense so the

663
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,960
timing is really really critical I don't

664
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,400
know if we we've probably talked in some

665
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,659
of your small groups about this concept

666
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,520
of a key and developmental position if

667
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,900
you if everybody knows this then I don't

668
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,480
have to talk about it just does do we

669
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,679
know what key and developmental means

670
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,620
okay I've seen a lot of head nods so but

671
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,840
in short these are the jobs you have to

672
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,520
have to be promoted to the next rank you

673
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,320
have to be able to do you have to do a

674
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,299
job it used to always be for Captain it

675
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,039
was easy it was just company command and

676
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,419
cyber it's a little different probably

677
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,400
team leads and and there's probably

678
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,840
variants that you can get through but

679
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
you'll know if you're going to a KD

680
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,980
position so the thing is if you think

681
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,880
about the timeline of when you go from

682
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,320
grad school to West Point and then back

683
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
out to the force that's five years

684
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,500
because it's like two about two-ish

685
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,179
years in grad school and then three

686
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,340
years at teaching at West Point those

687
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,779
are five years you can't do a key in

688
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,760
developmental position especially I

689
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,380
don't think I I don't think any of the

690
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,360
slots and eeks definitely the ones in a

691
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,960
ACI or not KD so you need to get that KD

692
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,299
job before you can apply so it puts you

693
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,880
in a tight time frame of really there's

694
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,740
optimal years and I think I did the

695
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,720
calculations it should be for this group

696
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,900
if you graduate this summer

697
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,940
2027 2028 is going to be the time frame

698
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,080
you're gonna that are going to be like

699
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,360
your optimal years 2029 is going to be

700
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,900
kind of the edge so really 28 is your is

701
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,779
is the is is the key time to do that

702
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,200
application in the that year the board

703
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,340
will meet

704
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,120
um the following uh

705
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,740
it'll probably meet December it'll

706
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,360
probably meet January the following the

707
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,580
beginning of the following year

708
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,659
announcements go out a few months after

709
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,340
that and then you don't start grad

710
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,840
school until the following year after

711
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,400
that so we have to do some really kind

712
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,320
of long-term yearly planning to make

713
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,140
this work because once that goes in this

714
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,760
binary request process happens we go

715
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,260
back and forth with Branch making sure

716
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,900
that your your career is on track and

717
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,100
then we and then we put you in grad

718
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,659
school the following year so it is a

719
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,640
long-term process I know that it's hard

720
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,260
to think about this now when you're just

721
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,220
trying to graduate but later on just try

722
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,700
to remember back that it takes that time

723
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,080
what do we look at when we when we have

724
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,400
people apply the GRE is one I I have a

725
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,539
love-hate relationship with that thing

726
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,860
the problem is when I'm sitting on a

727
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,900
board I look at it when I think of it as

728
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,640
myself the first time I took it I kind

729
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,799
of blew blew it up like it did not go so

730
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,440
well but I I've taken it probably two or

731
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,659
three times now and it is not something

732
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,460
you take cold is all I can tell you

733
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,559
there's great books out there to get you

734
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,720
just to understand the test so that you

735
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,299
can take it correctly it is a hard test

736
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,380
it is it's no joke but I've many many

737
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,820
people come in and they do it really

738
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,860
well the ones that we always have issues

739
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,720
with you see a perfect file and like

740
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,520
this is this person's great and their

741
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,559
Gres are pretty weak usually it's

742
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,179
because oh yeah I took it right after I

743
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,100
came out of the field that's not a good

744
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,520
time to do it don't don't do that uh it

745
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,320
planned it out early enough just take it

746
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,419
take it once get a feel for it and then

747
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,100
and then a year later maybe take it

748
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,980
again and that's just a that that'll

749
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,299
just give you an advantage on the board

750
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,460
if you're if you're really really want

751
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,960
to make sure you get you get back in

752
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,100
this

753
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,760
um and then the last thing I'll say is

754
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,260
there's this direct higher possibility

755
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,240
so I've talked with many people here

756
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,700
that are doing grad school I think Liam

757
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,559
he said he's starting grad school so you

758
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,900
you do grad school

759
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,520
um we don't

760
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,559
generally high like plan for direct

761
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,820
hires but the way it works is that uh

762
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,220
we put in all our people in our Pipeline

763
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,960
and then for various reasons family

764
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,919
reasons um change of thought of wanting

765
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,659
to do this reasons whatever it is we

766
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,460
have people that kind of drop off at

767
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,779
times and that's where we fill our

768
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,279
direct hires from so they're kind of a

769
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,440
one-off but we generally have one or two

770
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,720
available so if you have the degree and

771
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,220
your timeline starts to work out and you

772
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,200
think you could like start the following

773
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,360
summer or even before that if you think

774
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,440
it's something you may want to be

775
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,299
programmed in we can also program in

776
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,159
years out we can program in a direct

777
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,740
hire if it makes sense so those are

778
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,779
other options the last thing I'll say

779
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,760
there is a one more thing if you already

780
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,120
have your Masters and you did it on your

781
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,460
own or through a scholarship and you

782
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,559
want to do a PhD that's a three-year

783
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,260
process we can potentially support that

784
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,240
as well again the timelines are really

785
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
critical to start on time and and keep

786
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,799
your your keep your career on track so

787
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,840
HRC basically will not want to put you

788
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
in a bad position and put you in school

789
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
and then all of a sudden you come up on

790
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,460
a board and they look at it and they say

791
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,020
you haven't done the right stuff to get

792
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,220
promoted like you don't want to be in

793
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,200
that position and and we'll try to

794
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,059
screen that HRC everybody tries to look

795
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,100
at that to make that happen but

796
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,600
um if I can leave you with anything the

797
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,059
timeline timeline's critical applying

798
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,460
early is it is a good thing to do to to

799
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,380
at least get on the radar

800
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,720
um and if you're not interested in eeks

801
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,580
or ACI all the other departments are

802
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,080
always looking for people too so if you

803
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,159
want to teach in a social or in the law

804
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,539
department or if you wanted to get a

805
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:43,740
degree in one of those fields you want

806
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,720
to Branch out we need that that

807
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
diversity in cyber we have you know

808
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,020
almost you have like six different

809
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,480
departments I think uh represented

810
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,059
within ACI alone so it's the same

811
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,360
application teach.west1.edu and and you

812
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,100
can go from there so

813
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,779
that's all I have are there any

814
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,200
questions
