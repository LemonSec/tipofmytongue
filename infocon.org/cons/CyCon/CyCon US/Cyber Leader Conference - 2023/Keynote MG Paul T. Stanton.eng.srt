Georgia he graduated from this

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,059
institution West Point in 1995 and was

20

commissioned into the Infantry he

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,480
transitioned into the Cyber branch in

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,180
2015.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,379
um

24
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,059
he's earned three degrees in computer

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,619
science a bachelor's degree from the

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,939
United States Military Academy at West

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,439
Point a master's degree for the United

University of Illinois and a doctorate

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
from the Johns Hopkins University

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,540
now I'd like to just give a personal

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,780
note here about

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,180
General Stanton when I was at

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,619
Fort Meade uh I I knew of of major Paul

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,240
Stanton at the time because I think he

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,159
was he taught here in eeks as one of his

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,680
assignments and uh and I go over there

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,159
and um there's one one day I went to his

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,479
office I think I was actually walking

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,420
with him up there and I I normally take

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,340
the elevators but I learned quickly that

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,600
uh

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,180
uh Joe Stanton does not like elevators

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,939
very much so um we quickly double timed

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,700
it up to the fourth floor in Ops 2B I

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,159
think and uh he looked at me and said

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,439
something like um wow we just got like a

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,119
free workout and I was like I've never

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
thought of it that way but that is one

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
way to think of it so next time you go

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,180
up the stairs you're getting a free

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,860
workout

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,439
um so we we had a discussion at one

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
point about

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,139
um you know what we're going to be doing

55
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,459
in the Army I think he was a lieutenant

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,040
colonel at the time and then uh he uh he

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,360
and I discussed I said well I'm thinking

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,920
about going back to teach at West Point

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,180
but I haven't found a graduate school

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,040
he's like oh he's like what are you

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,360
think you're doing I was like I don't

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,239
know like data stuff visual

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,800
um stuff he's like oh you got to meet

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,940
this guy Randall and I was like I don't

65
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,180
know who Randall is so we um uh went and

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,760
had Vietnamese food I think down in DC

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,459
and and I met Randall Burns Dr Randall

68
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,560
Burns who was a Johns Hopkins computer

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,620
scientist and uh and sure enough that's

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,819
how I met my PhD advisor now what I I

71
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,739
remember going home thinking you know I

72
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,360
could do this I told my wife this is

73
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,580
going to suck I mean there's no doubt in

74
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,300
my mind that following in in Colonel

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,459
Stanton's shoes of trying to do a

76
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,379
computer science PhD on an army timeline

77
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,360
is probably uh is probably going to be

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,420
rough so um fast forward a few years

79
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,959
later I'm sitting in a hackerman hall

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,340
and there was the computer science

81
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,080
chair came out and said you know we've

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,440
got a problem it takes about six and 6.7

83
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,920
years to graduate a computer science PhD

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
at Johns Hopkins and that's just too

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,080
long

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,120
and so I'm looking there and I'm sitting

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,819
next to Randall burns my advisor

88
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,120
and as as we looked at this chart it has

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,040
all the people that were at the six year

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,599
mark But as we go to the left there's

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,099
this one dot

92
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,620
and it it was three years and he's like

93
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,239
that's Paul Stanton

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,879
and I was like holy crap

95
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,560
so

96
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,080
um with that

97
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,400
I'll I'll pass it over to General

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,519
Stanton who is the first as far as I can

99
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,159
tell Johns Hopkins graduate of computer

100
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,780
science and the Whiting School of

101
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,159
Engineering that could pull it off in

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,900
three years so

103
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,980
thanks sir I appreciate it

104
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,879
[Applause]

105
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,760
thanks Steven okay yes I am definitely

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,260
miked up because my voice is not that

107
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,939
loud I'm not going to get on the stage

108
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,580
because I'm told that I have to stay

109
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,798
within the bounds of the speakers but

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,858
I'm gonna just float around a little bit

111
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,560
um I did not know that story I

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,120
appreciate you embarrassing me if I

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,699
don't know if my my face is red or not

114
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,280
um but uh

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,220
Colonel Hamilton and I are we do have

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,979
some history and when he sent me a note

117
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,500
a couple months ago and said we're

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,220
looking for a keynote speaker at our at

119
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,380
our conference here's what the audience

120
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,680
is here's what the class of 1970 has set

121
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
up

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,180
um do you think you have time

123
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,400
no but I'll make it

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,860
because it's that important to have an

125
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,820
opportunity to to talk to this amazing

126
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,660
group of current and Future Leaders

127
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,120
so let me first say thank you to the

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,199
class of 1970 to Mr John Collins uh and

129
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,560
and uh Mr Frank Monaco uh Colonel

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
retired Frank Monaco his son and I went

131
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
to high school together and you know

132
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
there's like six degrees of separation

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
for all you data scientists out there

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,180
right

135
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,060
um that uh that we we've had an

136
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,520
enjoyable dinner catching up but thank

137
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,039
you to the class of 1974

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,840
the concept

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,960
of putting an entire cohort

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,000
of our cyber leaders in one room

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,639
and yes we can include our midshipmen

142
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah because they are valuable members

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,259
of the team you heard about five times

144
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,840
today that cyber is the ultimate team

145
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
sport you're going to hear me say it

146
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
probably about five or six more times

147
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,180
during the course of the next half hour

148
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,860
or so

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,139
let me say thank you to the Army cyber

150
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,080
Institute for putting this together

151
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,660
a lot of thought time and energy goes

152
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,660
into the coordination

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,060
things like doing an icebreaker last

154
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,020
night

155
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,900
and then when I walked up and did a

156
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,639
quick discussion with many of you

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,020
through the course of the day you were

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,780
talking to people that you had just met

159
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,600
that's huge part of the point

160
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
because this absolutely

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,340
is a team sport

162
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,419
because what we do is so challenging

163
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,580
there's absolutely no way that you can

164
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,719
be the expert in all of it

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you have to be good

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,160
but you can't be the expert in

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,340
everything that we need our cyber forces

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,979
to understand and know how to execute

169
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,139
the folks that are in this room

170
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,300
your cohort

171
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,380
will be your friends and your colleagues

172
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,460
for the rest of your lives

173
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,039
whether you stay in uniform or not

174
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,880
because the bonds that you make

175
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,560
through the challenges that you'll face

176
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,080
you'll learn how to depend on each other

177
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,960
in very powerful ways

178
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,699
and God forbid

179
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,880
we need you to do it in combat

180
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,300
that bond is Unbreakable

181
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,180
so you're in a powerful setting that is

182
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,340
setting the conditions

183
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,199
for your future

184
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
in uniform and out

185
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,460
quick thank you to the officers that are

186
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,460
in the room with us tonight

187
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,740
you start to really date yourself when

188
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,460
you see your former students being being

189
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,560
off the in the speakers in a panel

190
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,300
but I also have to say that I'm pretty

191
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,000
proud of the fact that that folks that I

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
had had the opportunity to work with

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,800
whether they were in my class or not I

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,860
recognize many from my time when I was

195
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,560
on the faculty here at West Point and

196
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,960
let me tell you that we picked the right

197
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,240
folks to come up here and provide

198
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
operational expertise and a step closer

199
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,660
to what you're going to be doing in the

200
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,699
near term I mean it's great you get the

201
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,400
generals to walk around we're old right

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,080
and we're more than a step removed from

203
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,458
company grade leadership that you'll be

204
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,020
executing in the near terms so I

205
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,740
appreciate the the officers the ncos the

206
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,179
warrant officers that are dedicating

207
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,399
their time to come up and offer their

208
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,300
their perspective

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,140
it's not lost on the yellow let's be

210
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,399
clear no one remembers the guest speaker

211
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
these things

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,980
like literally no one does a benefit is

213
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,200
that you've already had Chow

214
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600

216
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,600
uh for putting on uh a great spread but

217
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,060
you never remember the guest speaker

218
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,040
you can know me as like answer number 10

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,920
on your uh on the the survey from last

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
night the scavenger hunt right

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
um but like whether or not you you know

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
who I am

223
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,339
um I might run into you on Barton field

224
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,779
when you're down at Fort Gordon next

225
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,720
year so watch that I mean a notable

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,200
exception uh to the the guest speaker is

227
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,940
Burger General vile who

228
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,800
masquerades as the Cyber commandant he's

229
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,899
really a Mill Art P

230
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,480
um at West Point

231
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,980
um but but think back to the message

232
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,839
that he delivered

233
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,320
what has changed in the past 100 years

234
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,200
in the execute of the fight is what you

235
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,540
are responsible for

236
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,240
that's huge

237
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,019
and what a poignant exclamation point on

238
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,459
his talk

239
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,160
with the idea of taking our enemies back

240
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,160
to 1919.

241
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
based off what you are going to be able

242
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
to do

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,000
when you join the force

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,140
next year

245
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,180
that's right around the corner

246
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,640
hey so you won't remember me

247
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,580
you won't remember much about my message

248
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,200
but I'm going to keep it simple as a

249
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,380
result

250
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,459
be a leader

251
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,839
what do I need from you what do I want

252
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,600
from you what do I expect of you

253
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,860
be

254
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,320
a leader

255
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,300
there'll be a test at the end of this

256
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,860
see if you can

257
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,260
keep pace

258
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,839
one of the most critical aspects

259
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,079
of leadership in specifically leadership

260
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,660
in the military in even more

261
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,339
specifically leadership in the United

262
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,459
States Army I like to refer to it as the

263
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,540
trust continuum

264
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,260
you must demonstrate competence

265
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,180
you heard some of our leaders talk about

266
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,820
it earlier today

267
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,579
you must demonstrate competence if you

268
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,620
don't

269
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,540
your soldiers

270
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,760
the civilians that work with you will

271
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,420
sniff you out in a heartbeat

272
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,660
you demonstrate competence to earn their

273
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,160
respect

274
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,200
we're a disciplined Army

275
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,860
we're a disciplined Joint Force

276
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,839
you will get respect

277
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,820
from your subordinates based off the

278
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,320
rank that you have on your chest or your

279
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,700
shoulders wherever you're wearing it on

280
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,620
what uniform you have on

281
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,140
they will offer you that respect but you

282
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,480
have to earn their respect as a human

283
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,140
being and as a leader that's earned

284
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,420
and it's earned through your

285
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,560
demonstrated competence

286
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,300
when your soldiers see that you know

287
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,880
what you're talking about

288
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,959
they will follow you

289
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,660
when they Trust

290
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,880
that you will one know what you're

291
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,820
talking about in two deliver guidance

292
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,560
and orders in an ethical and moral

293
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,579
manner

294
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,079
you will earn their trust

295
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,000
if likewise your subordinates

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,459
demonstrate their competence

297
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,880
and they live ethically and morally that

298
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,040
trust becomes bi-directional and that is

299
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,079
what makes our army the best army in the

300
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,420
world we can execute through commander's

301
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,300
intent and execute Mission command I can

302
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,079
let you execute to discipline initiative

303
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,120
because there's Mutual trust between you

304
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,959
and your subordinates

305
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,440
are no other army in the world

306
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,660
can operate like the United States Army

307
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,439
in that regard

308
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,660
disciplined initiative through Mission

309
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,199
command

310
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,899
but you have to be a leader

311
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,040
to get to that point

312
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
competence

313
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,880
you heard major I can't get over saying

314
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,220
that Keith I'm going to keep doing it

315
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,440
you heard major earlier today talk about

316
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,200
technical competence

317
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
and you heard Jason the course you talk

318
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,220
about what it means to be a tool

319
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,839
developer and how you have to have

320
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,800
skills

321
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,980
absolutely the case

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,380
you are a special group

323
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,360
for every one of you

324
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,180
it's in the room tonight there were 10

325
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,560
more that wanted the seat that you're in

326
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,920
we don't have a problem

327
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,220
recruiting officers that want to become

328
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,860
cyber officers in our army

329
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,200
you earned the seat that you're in

330
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,360
how many stripes are on the shoulders on

331
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,040
the uniforms in this room

332
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,740
how many stars are on the collar

333
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,700
I know what that means

334
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,860
I can read the room I know who's in here

335
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,320
I also know that General vile and his

336
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,139
team recruited you and have been talking

337
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,540
to you for a couple years because we

338
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,760
need the best and brightest

339
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,600
you passed that test congratulations

340
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,579
now wrap yourself in a warm blanket of

341
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,019
confidence and get ready to get to work

342
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,920
because you must be a self-directed

343
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,260
learner

344
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,199
in order to be technically competent in

345
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,939
the cyberspace warfighting domain

346
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,339
you must be a self-directed learner

347
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,940
the rate of change of technology and the

348
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,100
rate of change of our enemies in our

349
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,560
adversaries is too great what you know

350
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,420
today will not be what you need for

351
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,660
tomorrow

352
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,660
we must continue to learn you must

353
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,380
continue to learn

354
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,860
it'll change

355
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,100
by the time you finish Bullock

356
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,320
it'll change by the time you get to your

357
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
first unit of assignment

358
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,000
you've got to stay on top of your game

359
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,620
however back to my first point about

360
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,380
who's in this room your cohort

361
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,480
you cannot be an expert in everything

362
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,800
you have to understand as an officer

363
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,420
the entire warfighting domain

364
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,300
but you can't be an expert in networking

365
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,820
in forensic analysis

366
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,279
in big data analytics

367
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,920
and the list goes on

368
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,980
you have to know who's in this room with

369
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,639
you that who has that expertise

370
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,279
so that when you need to phone a friend

371
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,620
you know where to find her or him

372
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,199
and then you have to bring your game

373
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,980
collectively we have to work together

374
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,380
you may be an expert in

375
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,199
routing and you may have studied the

376
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,940
Cisco command line and you've got it

377
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,899
down and and you're you're hot on how to

378
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,880
configure a router do you know how to

379
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,079
configure a Huawei router

380
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,040
do you know what the firmware inside the

381
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,019
Huawei router looks like

382
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,639
do you know what happens when you issue

383
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,380
a command how it operates on the inside

384
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,779
I'm not asking Jason he probably does

385
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,360
you have to be

386
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,820
a self-directed learner

387
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,579
you have to be humble

388
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,440
to recognize that you won't know

389
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
everything

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,699
and you must lean on each other

391
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,439
to develop that

392
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,600
technical competence and expertise

393
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,380
but that's not good enough either

394
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,540
forgive me for the midshipmen in the

395
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,619
room

396
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,199
but when you graduate next year it says

397
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
U.S Army on your chest

398
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,140
so you must be a technical professional

399
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,799
and you must demonstrate your competence

400
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
but don't ever forget that you're an

401
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,260
army professional

402
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,539
and with that comes expectations

403
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,059
I expect you to know your troop leading

404
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,980
procedures

405
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,380
as discussed earlier this afternoon I

406
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,240
expect you to understand the military

407
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,419
decision making process I expect you to

408
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,220
understand the vernacular of our

409
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,299
warfighting forces

410
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,440
if you are a technical expert and you

411
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
can't effectively communicate to a

412
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,980
warfighting maneuver Commander you're no

413
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,400
good to me

414
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,039
you've got to be able to communicate it

415
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,620
a great idea that you can't communicate

416
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,000
is not a great idea

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,140
and we have a community

418
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,140
inside of our profession that expects

419
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,620
you to communicate using the terms of

420
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,159
our profession

421
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,860
we cannot have

422
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,380
a three-star General

423
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,200
sit on a conference panel and talk about

424
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,039
dolphin speak

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,039
that's not okay

426
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,140
it's on us

427
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,260
to be able to take a highly technical

428
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,620
topic incredibly complex

429
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,660
and put it into

430
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,940
words and Concepts and visualizations

431
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,740
that

432
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,860
our community can understand

433
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,500
that's when we become effective think

434
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,260
about the inverse what happens the first

435
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,100
time

436
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,860
the Battalion Commander asks the 17

437
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,799
Alpha in the formation something about

438
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,000
cyber

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,620
and that 17 Alpha doesn't have the

440
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,219
slightest idea

441
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,879
you're instantly marginalized

442
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,059
and how many 17 Alphas remember the

443
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,860
charts from earlier today how many 17

444
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,320
Alphas are in the formation out there

445
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
with the Infantry and armor and field

446
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,660
artillery Battalion Commanders

447
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,179
you're it

448
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,340
you're alone and unafraid

449
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,799
as the representative of understanding

450
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,720
our war fighting domain

451
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,100
to the rest of the army

452
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,200
if you're marginalized guess what

453
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,140
happens in that Leader's eyes

454
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,720
cyber is shut down

455
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
I asked the Cyber question of the Cyber

456
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,559
expert that expert couldn't answer it I

457
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,940
don't have time for this I'm going back

458
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,500
to the mat board and I'm getting ready

459
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,179
to go shoot move and communicate sleuth

460
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,440
turret and engage targets

461
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,660
and that is not okay

462
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,059
because our maneuver forces will die in

463
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,980
combat and large-scale combat operations

464
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,020
without your support remember what

465
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,280
happened over the last hundred years

466
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
what's changed is what you're

467
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
responsible for the enemy can see you on

468
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,100
the battlefield

469
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,940
Indio FM 3.0 says You must operate under

470
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,700
constant observation it is not okay for

471
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,799
the maneuverists to ignore what you have

472
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,780
to say

473
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,500
so be able to express it in terms that

474
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,240
resonate with the maneuver Commander

475
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,580
and don't be timid and shy about it be a

476
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,780
leader

477
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,360
walk into the command post with your

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,620
chest up like you know what you're

479
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,780
talking about because you do and then

480
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
effectively communicate it to that

481
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,080
Commander In terms that he or she

482
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,620
understands

483
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,179
that's being professionally competent

484
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,400
put those two pieces together you got to

485
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,260
be technically competent you have to be

486
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,280
an army professional

487
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,400
be a leader

488
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
you have to figure out how to put the

489
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,918
pieces together

490
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,059
such that you as company grade officers

491
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,380
can build the teams of the future

492
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,440
you will show up to a formation

493
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,679
and you will have ncos and warrant

494
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,260
officers and civilians

495
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,659
that have been on those teams

496
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,320
for years

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,480
25 percent of the formation as general

498
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,760
vile told you this morning already have

499
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,200
degrees

500
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
they're past you already

501
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,380
and they've got operational experience

502
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,059
you have to step in and leave that

503
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,440
formation

504
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,280
but wait a minute

505
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,380
if you're going into an infantry platoon

506
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,299
hasn't that NCO also been there for

507
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,880
years with tons of experience

508
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,039
yeah it's not that different

509
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,159
it's not that different with a notable

510
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,039
exception of the technical expertise

511
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,799
that no one individual

512
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,240
can master all of it

513
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,159
so when you walk in to lead your small

514
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,400
unit

515
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,679
you need to understand who your people

516
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,260
are what their skills are what they

517
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,480
bring to the team and then you have to

518
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,799
be the leader to build the team

519
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,659
someone on that team is going to be a

520
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,880
network expert someone is going to be a

521
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,100
host analyst expert someone is going to

522
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,460
be a data analyst your job as an officer

523
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,919
is to be able to understand how to build

524
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,980
a team effectively to achieve Mission

525
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,620
outcomes

526
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,299
and to take care of your people

527
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,760
understand who they are

528
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,100
on a personal level

529
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,140
as was explained to you earlier this

530
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,440
afternoon such that you can Inspire them

531
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
to their life's best performances

532
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,720
that's what being a leader in this space

533
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,080
is about

534
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,120
giving them the opportunity to

535
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,400
demonstrate their expertise

536
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,860
but harnessing it into

537
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,219
an organized unit to achieve an effect

538
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,460
recognizing that you're not going to be

539
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,720
able to do it

540
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,700
on yourself recognizing that you're

541
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,580
going to have those dependencies

542
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,460
recognizing and having humility in that

543
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,080
you're going to have dependencies

544
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
but as several folks have said earlier

545
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,700
today

546
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,539
your future is bright

547
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,419
congratulations on having earned a seat

548
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,080

congratulations on what you've

550
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,460
demonstrated to date

551
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,539
now harness that

552
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,640
turn it into

553
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,080

554
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,460
