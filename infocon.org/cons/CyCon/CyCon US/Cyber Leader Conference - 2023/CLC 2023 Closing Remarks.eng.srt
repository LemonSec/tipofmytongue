90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
half days the conference was terrific

91
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,360
and I'm very proud that our class was

92
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,120
able to host it and sponsor it it's

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
really gratifying to see

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
um how well it went and I think we

95
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
should give a big round of applause to

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,440
ACI Colonel Hamilton Dr Maxwell

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,660
Colonel Arnold whose organizational

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,820
skills were apparent throughout but give

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
them all a big round of applause really

100
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,160
did a tremendous job thanks

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,340
and and I don't know if uh General

102
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,560
Hernandez is still here but I'm going to

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,540
give him the the name of the Godfather

104
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,180
of the Cyber conference because he was

105
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,699
instrumental in uh helping our class

106
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,000
make the decision to uh to sponsor then

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,639
Host this conference and uh you know I

108
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,740
think Godfather of the conference is is

109
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,860
a good moniker for him to have

110
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,860
and I think that um

111
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,020
all of you were a big part of the

112
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,960
conference so I thank you for attending

113
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
participating and all the company grade

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
officers ncos and warrant officers who

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
participated you provided the substance

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
for the conference and made it as

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
meaningful as it is and meaningful in

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
the sense that we look at it as a class

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
as we're contributing to the future of

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,120
the army and I think that's that's an

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,860
important thing to us as a class

122
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,500
certainly going forward and lastly I'd

123
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
like to just recognize the support that

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,699
we've gotten from the AOG and the people

125
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,340
that do the buses the meals the audio

126
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,340
visual I think that was a tremendous

127
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,320
part of it and I thank them very much

128
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
and I thank you all and have a safe trip
