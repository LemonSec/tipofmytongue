Army uh you know going on about 16 years

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
in the Army now uh started off as a

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
military intelligence officer then

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,119

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,220
Squadron I can absolutely say hey cyber

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,500
is the best you should all be excited uh

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,939
even Navy who's going to get to go

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,280
information Warfare you're going to have

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,979
a fun career ahead of you and I look

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,720
forward to talking about some jobs you

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,820
can expect as a lieutenant and kind of

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,799
my expectations of lieutenants is a

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,479
field grade officer

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,520
uh also would be remiss if I didn't say

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,380
I'm a little bit jealous you know when I

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,640
graduated 2007 cyber wasn't an option uh

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,560
if I had the opportunity to come

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,479
straight out of West Point working cyber

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,880
maybe as a developer can talk some of

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,799
that later that would have been you know

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,960
amazing but it didn't exist so I had to

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,939
go Mi and then try to fight my way to

45
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,579
cyber once the Army finally uh did

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,720
create it

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,360
so I want to start off talking some of

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,159
the jobs that I've had as a field grade

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
officer and the lieutenants that I had

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
working for me most of my experience has

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
all been on the offensive side so if

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,940
you've got any good OKO or offensive

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,819
cyber questions that you think of uh

54
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,099
feel free to ask those and I'll answer

55
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,980
those as well uh first job is a field

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,900
grade officer working offensive cyber

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,700
with something called The Joint Mission

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,580
operations center director and chief of

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,620
the Cyber Solutions development Georgia

60
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,980
yes that's a mouthful it meant I ran the

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,500
uh the offensive infrastructure where we

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,060
actually did as I tell my wife the

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,220
hacking from and then I was also in

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,459
charge of the developers uh down in

65
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,160
Georgia this was before 17 Delta before

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,599
17 Bravo everybody was a 17 Alpha maybe

67
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,599
some holdover 17 X-rays at the time

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,019
before they all became Alphas as well uh

69
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,780
running that jmoc uh really important

70
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,599
mission for offensive cyber uh the jmoc

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,519
that joint Mission operations center is

72
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,319
the room where we do all the offensive

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,540
cyber missions from a lot of thought

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
that goes in there had one Lieutenant on

75
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,400
a rotational uh period uh wasn't

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,900
directly assigned to me working as

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,780
something called a technical director

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,519
their responsibilities highly technical

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,700
in nature in charge of maybe one or two

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,760
other warrant officers and a couple ncos

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,319
but the main part of their job was

82
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,659
creating the uh the infrastructure where

83
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,459
we could actually go do offensive

84
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,340
missions so setting up the computers the

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,319
networks working with commercial vendors

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,840
so when we got out to the internet to do

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,760
offensive missions we didn't look like

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,940
we were a U.S government or U.S army so

89
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,940
there's no attribution back uh some late

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,940
nights emergency calls but again a very

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,860
highly technical job setting up that

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,659
Network that was kind of that

93
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,459
Lieutenant's main focus

94
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,400
dual had it as a chief of the developers

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,980
down in Georgia I had five lieutenants

96
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,620
working for me and both of those jobs

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,959
there are no captains in between so it's

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,519
directly second first lieutenants

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,400
working for me as a major uh no issues

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,459
there at all uh you know from the from

101
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,680
either lieutenants or uh not having the

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,380
captains uh but those those lieutenants

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,500
working purely as developers all day uh

104
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,478
every day in and out for the Army uh

105
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,820
living as developers uh some flavor of

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,580
reverse malware engineering uh Windows

107
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,639
access Unix access persistence all the

108
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,020
things you saw on the slide of

109
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,479
opportunities to be a developer they had

110
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,180
the opportunity to do it if you talk to

111
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,520
any of them the ones who are still in

112
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,440
I'll switch to Delta they love it they

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
say it's the best job they've ever had

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,860
it's also the first and only job they

115
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,960
ever had in the Army so they might be a

116
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,660
little bit uh biased there I had the

117
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,460
opportunity to intern as a developer

118
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,900
when I was in grad school and I thought

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,520
it was one of the best jobs I had in the

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,820
Army but I think most the Cyber jobs are

121
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,259
pretty awesome

122
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,120
after that I went on to become a

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,000
battalion S3 yes even cyber you'll get

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,580
staff jobs one day as a major you can

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,680
look forward to becoming a S3 or XO

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,139
unless maybe you come to ACI or

127
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,759
something but they might still have to

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
do it I did have one Lieutenant who

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,900
worked for me in the S3 shop it was not

130
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,780
her first pick she was kind of the last

131
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,699
Lieutenant who came to the unit and so I

132
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,820
gotta have her as a assistant S3

133
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,000
uh her role's responsibilities were

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,740
doing everything that I did when I

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,600
wasn't there so she had to fill in as a

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
major as a brand new second Lieutenant

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,979
it was also right during the height of

138
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,620
kovid so we made her the Battalion uh

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,139
covid task force lead or or whatever the

140
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,000
job title was she was in charge of

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,539
making sure the Battalion survived covid

142
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,979
if we knew what kovid was going to turn

143
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,600
into at the start we would not have put

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,280
a brand new second lieutenant in charge

145
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,039
of that job but she crushed it she

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
absolutely ran with that staff job her

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,660
intent offense of cyber was to be an

148
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,240
operator based on the great job she did

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,580
there we put her into cnoqc got her to

150
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,860
be an operator after serving a few

151
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,620
months as a assistant Battalion S3 and

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,139
I'll talk a little bit about that later

153
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,880
right after that I served as a 106

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,280
combat mission team lead all still down

155
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,720
in Georgia

156
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,259
um

157
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,900
there again no captains but I had three

158
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,060
lieutenants who worked for me uh you

159
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,380
know on the offensive side we didn't

160
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,060
really have we don't have platoon

161
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,520
leaders like you saw in the 17 Bravo

162
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,740
kind of the 11th cyber warfare but I'd

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,120
argue that they were really doing a

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,800
platoon leader job even though we didn't

165
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,660
call it that I think their official

166
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,680
title was current operations officer

167
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,020
fuops officer line of effort lead but

168
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,340
they were really operating as those

169
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,740
platoon leaders they had a small section

170
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,560
assigned to them some ncos maybe a

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
warrant officer and they were in charge

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
of making sure that section could carry

173
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,280
out missions that I gave them to execute

174
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,500
uh they would do everything from

175
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,259
planning offensive cyber operations help

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,960
gather Intel and then actually executing

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,419
the Cyber operations in that uh that

178
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,720
jmoc that I had run in a previous job

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
I also had one Lieutenant on my team who

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,919
kind of skirted the line again before

181
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,780
Deltas existed he was uh um kind of a

182
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,940
research and Engineering type role it

183
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,740
doesn't exist on paper but he had a

184
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,840
knack for it and it worked out well he

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
later went on to certify as a 17 Delta

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,819
is a senior developer now down in

187
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,199
Georgia

188
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,900
but he worked as kind of a developer for

189
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,759
the team so we're going to talk some

190
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,620
vignettes later and one thing that might

191
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,060
pop up is how do you request

192
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,280
capabilities or offensive side how do

193
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,780
you request capabilities if you need

194
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,599
them having this Lieutenant embedded

195
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,639
kind of that role on the team he could

196
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
sit on the Ops as we did them and

197
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,599
Advocate on our behalf for new offensive

198
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,759
capabilities that we needed

199
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,460
uh fast forward to the job I'm in now a

200
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,199
cyber National Mission Force up at Fort

201
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,340
Meade and also uh the uh 61 National

202
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,160
mission team team lead uh very similar

203
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
to a combat mission team down in Georgia

204
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,900
for 106. uh difference being I actually

205
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
have captains now so being up at the

206
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,520
cnmf I have three captains and I have

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
one Navy Lieutenant which is the same as

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,020
a captain just Navy uh and then I have

209
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
three lieutenants and uh one Navy Ensign

210
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,379
and one Navy uh Lieutenant uh JG

211
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,139
um so a lot more officers I'm in charge

212
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,539
of four teams up in uh cnmf instead of

213
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,180
just the one but fairly similar roles

214
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,399
the the two Navy officers are on

215
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,219
National cyber protection teams uh sub

216
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,979
element or Mission element leads also

217
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,559
can fill in as that CPT leader when the

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,380
CPT uh leads not there on the national

219
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,920
Mission side I've got two well uh of the

220
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,779
three lieutenants one is in operator

221
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,140
training right now he's completed CNO QC

222
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,959
so you can do uh Army title 10 offensive

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,760
missions and he's working towards

224
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,220
certification for Army title 50

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,339
operations so full time if he's not

226
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,500
doing Ops on breaks in between classes

227
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,660
uh we're training him up to be uh

228
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,540
offensive cyber operator the ion that

229
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,240
you see on some of the slides

230
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,339
I have a another Lieutenant she's kind

231
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,660
of a in my task force j3 section so

232
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,279
again probably not a role she really

233
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,940
wants to do offensive cyber 17 Alpha but

234
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,700
she's crushing it there as well

235
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,279
scheduling all of our operations making

236
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
sure that the offensive teams have the

237
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
the resources they need and once I find

238
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
a replacement I'm probably going to push

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,620
her out to one of the jobs one of the

240
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,080
captains is doing right now as a line of

241
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,180
effort lead or kind of a little bit more

242
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,279
than the the platoon leader type role I

243
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,100
had a officers doing down in Georgia

244
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,440
other lieutenants kind of doing that r e

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,019
type role again he is thinking about

246
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,839
doing a 17 Delta and so I'm letting him

247
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,640
explore what it's like to be a developer

248
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,580
work through the jqr schedule something

249
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,100
called the basic skill level exam so

250
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,680
that if he wants to go to the 17 Delta

251
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
Captain's career course and switch over

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,200
he'll be postured uh able to do that

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,800
um

254
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,660
so those are kind of the jobs that I've

255
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,200
had lieutenants do uh directly for me

256
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,640
most times it has been directly

257
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,339
reporting uh to me so as you get out

258
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,380
into your first jobs and your you know

259
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
brand new second Lieutenant you might be

260
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,240
directly reporting to uh to a major uh

261
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,100
there might be no no captains in between

262
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,160
uh it'll just depend on the unit and how

263
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
many uh uh captains there are in those

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,940
positions

265
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,360
uh my advice or kind of what I expect of

266
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
lieutenants uh three main things I want

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
you to be able to to listen to learn and

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,740
to lead and I'll talk about all of those

269
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,440
listening uh hugely important I I need

270
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,019
you to understand uh what the mission is

271
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,480
what my intent is and to be able to

272
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,000
execute off of that I expect that you're

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,380
going to have questions if you didn't

274
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,120
have questions I think you weren't

275
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
actually listening but I'm not going to

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,079
answer all those questions for you I'm

277
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,519
going to expect you to go out and find

278
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,220
answers for that or at least work to and

279
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,800
then come back if you can't part of that

280
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,779
lesson you're not always going to get

281
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,540
positive uh feedback or affirmation that

282
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,880
you're doing a good job there's just

283
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,220
simply too much going on no one's going

284
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,680
to be telling you all the time hey

285
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,019
you're doing a great job you'll most

286
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,700
likely hear if you're not doing a good

287
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,160
job if you don't hear that it's safe to

288
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,260
assume you probably are doing a a good

289
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,420
job I remind myself to tell all my

290
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,160
lieutenants they're doing a good job I

291
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,500
just don't myself do a good job at doing

292
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,019
that all the time

293
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,839
learn I expect you to continue

294
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,519
continually be learning especially on

295
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,339
the offensive side even if you even if

296
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,959
you go straight to grad school after

297
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,880
West Point you come in with a masters of

298
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,920
computer science there's probably a

299
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
enlisted Soldier definitely a warrant

300
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,240
officer who knows a lot more about cyber

301
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,640
and has more experience than you I

302
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,100
expect you to learn from them about how

303
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,680
you can be an effective team member

304
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,019
skills that they've uh picked up their

305
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,920
time on offensive cyber uh there was a

306
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,620
uh former Army cyber commander who once

307
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,660
said that we don't fail enough in cyber

308
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,079
uh I expect you to fail I'm going to

309
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,180
give you tasks I'm going to give you the

310
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,339
latitude to fail and make mistakes and

311
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,860
it's going to be okay as long as you

312
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,959
don't make the same mistakes repeatedly

313
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
everything's going to work out at the

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,680
end of the day but I want you kind of

315
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,779
pushing that boundary as you learn uh

316
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,380
what's acceptable what's not acceptable

317
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,019
and then lead for leading uh you know we

318
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,880
talked humility I think major major

319
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,639
talked about uh humility hugely

320
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,680
important being able to take

321
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,420
constructive criticism having a tenacity

322
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,760
a presence for your soldiers you know if

323
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
you have soldiers doing something I

324
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,480
expect you to be there with them as well

325
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,180
just being around for the missions not

326
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,920
hiding away in an office or at a

327
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,500
computer somewhere along with that

328
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,139
actually knowing your soldiers and I

329
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,120
don't mean just knowing their name but

330
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
knowing details about them what they

331
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
like to do in their free time what pets

332
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,399
they have what their family like is life

333
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,820
as if they were one of your friends now

334
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,279
obviously uh don't blur the lines with

335
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,139
with fraternization but I do expect you

336
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,720
to know the people you work with we

337
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,820
talked about you know people are the

338
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,860
mission I've always found that if you

339
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,240
take care of people the mission will

340
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,980
take care of itself and so that's

341
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,220
something I expect of uh lieutenants as

342
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,940
well

343
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,120
uh another thing I kind of expect uh not

344
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,000
to be a complainer have a bad attitude a

345
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,860
question came up during one of the uh

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,959
breakout sessions what's the biggest

347
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
mistake you've ever seen a new

348
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,820
lieutenant uh do or commit and I said uh

349
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,980
having a bad attitude always being

350
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,320
negative not liking the job that they're

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,600
currently doing and uh being very vocal

352
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,660
about it and uh that is probably the the

353
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,060
biggest mistake I've seen I'd say don't

354
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,680
worry about whatever your current job is

355
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
just do it well and you'll be you'll be

356
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,600
successful

357
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,519
some questions for you guys who's

358
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,980
nervous about being a second lieutenant

359
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,200
in cyber branch

360
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,320
okay good uh you should be right it's a

361
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,579
big Endeavor you're going to be

362
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,980
responsible for a lot of things people

363
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,959
Mission especially on the offensive side

364
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,200
I remember sitting in your shoes knowing

365
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,820
that I was going to Branch Mi and I was

366
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,680
nervous what is an MI platoon leader do

367
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
and we had a a branch day or something

368
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,779
similar to this and you know we all

369
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,420
asked the lieutenants in in the platoon

370
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,040
sergeants who showed up like what makes

371
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,440
me a good platoon leader and you know

372
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,120
what they said was take care of your

373
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,100
people if you really care about your

374
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,380
people and take care of them you'll

375
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,800
succeed

376
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,779
uh if you come offensive side in

377
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,300
addition to uh kind of the the role that

378
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,220
you take on you'll also get certified as

379
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,980
a mission Commander and I know some of

380
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,300
the breakouts I've talked about what

381
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,399
that is but a lot of questions came up

382
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,820
when we do an offensive cyber Mission uh

383
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,440
the core of the team that does it is

384
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,720
three people uh one you've got your

385
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
operator uh they're the hacker on

386
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
keyboard doing the actual operation two

387
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,860
you've got your exploitation analyst

388
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,139
your EA they're the one who knows

389
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,519
everything there is to know about the

390
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,199
network they've come up with the plan

391
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,540
that the operator is doing they know the

392
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,060
ins and outs what to expect and then the

393
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,560
third person is your mission Commander

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,779
if you come offensive cyber you're going

395
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,940
to be one of those Mission commanders as

396
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,800
a mission Commander I expect you to know

397
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,420
the left and right limits of what you

398
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,180
can do on the the operation when the

399
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,639
request exceptions and to work well with

400
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,500
that team so they can be successful on

401
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,720
their operation

402
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,300
a couple questions came up admin versus

403
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,480
operational responsibilities uh even if

404
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,519
you're on a cyber National Mission Force

405
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,019
you're still in the Army you'll still

406
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,540
have army requirements uh good news is

407
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,220
you won't have to do an ioct anymore

408
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,279
just the acft so that that'll be done

409
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,380
once you graduate you'll still have all

410
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,060
the mandatory army training height

411
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,779
weight PT tests they'll also be uh kind

412
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,779
of outside of the job expectations you

413
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,639
might be put in charge of leading a

414
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,779
company morale event hail and farewell

415
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,300
something like that my very first job

416
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,060
when I was a mi platoon leader my

417
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,040
Battalion Commander loved skeet shooting

418
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,139
and so I was the Battalion skeet team

419
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,779
captain I think it was more hazing than

420
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,639
anything else because I'd never shot a

421
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,800
shotgun and they all like to see how big

422
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
of a bruise I got in my shoulder after

423
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,420
trying to to shoot skeet

424
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,860
um

425
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,139
you know uh I'd say just just take a

426
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,540
deep breath you'll be fine uh as a

427
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,240
lieutenant as long as you uh you uh can

428
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,420
listen learn and Lead

429
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,479
um

430
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
I'd say also it's important to know your

431
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,760
peers and know what's possible and uh

432
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
where to look you know an event like

433
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,199
this where you can hear from defensive

434
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,140
offensive 17 Bravo 17 deltas and just

435
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,000
know what's out there will be hugely

436
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,740
important as you go on to bollock

437
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,540
getting to know uh the people that are

438
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,699
in your class what assignments they get

439
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,140
where they're at so that if you ever

440
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,579
have a question that pops up later

441
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,740
sometimes that alone can be more

442
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,720
valuable than the periods of instruction

443
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,100
that you get there

444
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,480
um yeah I expect a special offensive

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,220
side that you'll have a good technical

446
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,440
understanding and that you'll be able to

447
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,500
make decisions uh you know if you come

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,059
into the unit and you're afraid to make

449
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,100
decisions that's going to separate you

450
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
out from the people who can make a

451
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
decision an informed decision and stick

452
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,719
with it there

453
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,320
okay uh I think I covered all of the uh

454
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,299
the talking points that I had uh what

455
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,500
questions does anybody have

456
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,520
they said somebody had to have a

457
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,639
question

458
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,500
who thinks they want to go uh 17 Alpha

459
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,460
offensive cyber

460
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,200
a couple people

461
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,059
who definitely doesn't want to do

462
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,860
offensive cyber

463
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,918
nobody one okay couple

464
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,520
uh any any questions at all anybody

465
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,640
yeah there we go sir what was the

466
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,380
biggest difference moving from working

467
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,280
under our cyber to CNN yeah uh so

468
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,039
working Army cyber so one of the service

469
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,780
cyber components and working for

470
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,020
something called a a jfhqc a Joint Force

471
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,960
Headquarters cyber uh you have a so as a

472
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,340
combat mission team that's what I was

473
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,140
doing you have a purely offensive

474
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,080
Mission your job all day every day is to

475
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,840
go do offensive cyber against targets

476
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,539
that support that uh combatant level

477
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,360
command working in the Cyber National

478
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,460
Mission Force our mission is to defend

479
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,740
the nation so even though we're

480
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,980
offensive cyber team the flavor of that

481
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,160
is defense so our job is to know

482
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,500
adversary we call them malicious cyber

483
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,440
actors MCAS uh what they're up to and

484
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,900
stay a step ahead of them I like to say

485
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,299
our job is to hack the hackers so that

486
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,940
we can help protect the United States so

487
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,020
that's that's the biggest difference

488
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,360
between the two

489
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,959
yeah

490
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,700
combat teams like if you're doing your

491
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,160
permission do you guys

492
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,280
yep uh absolutely have to coordinate uh

493
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
we're fortunate that cyber command is a

494
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,539
combatant command uh so we have that

495
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,520
four star who can help Advocate on our

496
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,860
behalf but any effects that we want to

497
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,260
do when someone else's uh region we we

498
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,700
do coordinate with them

499
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,860
sir so there is a training program which

500
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,380
you may be familiar with the cnoqc the

501
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,240
on network operator qualification course

502
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,000
are there similar training pipelines for

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,460
the exploitation analyst and other such

504
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,700
work roles yep uh so each of the uh work

505
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,100
roles I think it was the last block on

506
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,039
the top of uh Colonel Arnold's slide

507
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,320
that said unit specific training uh

508
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,760
depending on what work role you get

509
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,679
you're going to go into a pipeline of

510
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,380
training if you come up and you're if

511
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,880
you come to offensive unit and you're

512
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,100
not sure what job you want to do we do

513
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,679
have kind of a test that'll test uh and

514
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,120
kind of give you a result of maybe you

515
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
would be good at this maybe you'd be a

516
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
great EA and operator developer or other

517
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,059
work roles so those type of uh just uh

518
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,580
not exams but a basic test can help sort

519
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,700
that out every every work role does I'd

520
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
say as a lieutenant too is a great time

521
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,039
to experiment and try different jobs so

522
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,900
I've had the lieutenants try to be an

523
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,100
operator fail cnoqc and then go on to do

524
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
a different work role and they were glad

525
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,520
they did that as a lieutenant versus

526
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,799
trying to pigeonhole themselves in a as

527
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,960
a captain or another position

528
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,799
anybody else

529
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,220
all right

530
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,799
thank you for that
