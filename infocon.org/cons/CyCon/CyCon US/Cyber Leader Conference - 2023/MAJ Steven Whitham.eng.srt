1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,420
uh welcome this is the uh last day now

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,980
of this event

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,080
um I'm pretty excited to see some of the

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,640
conversations have just been phenomenal

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,359
so some great exchange of information uh

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,199
amongst everyone so this is uh this is

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,300
very exciting for me now taking over as

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,579
director and looking at at how this has

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,200
formed over several years to try to

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
bring it to this this this event of this

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,460
size so

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,800
um I want to thank everybody for that

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,719
one one thing I do want to say is

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,760
there's one group that I have not think

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,340
that is important and if I could get

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,620
they're probably all in the back but

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,200
um my my core division is what puts this

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,680
on for ACI so the Cyber operations

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,420
research element I'll give a brief later

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,460
today about kind of how we break down

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,399
ACI but Lieutenant Colonel Todd Arnold

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,180
and and his team back there put in a lot

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,340
of work especially in the last month or

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,119
so of uh of trying to make sure the

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,619
logistics that all of the pieces and

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,479
parts came together to make this happen

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,939
and from my viewpoint it looks fairly

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,740
seamless from the group chat that I'm on

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,840
with them there's a lot of a lot of

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,400
things that had to be kind of wickered

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,900
out to make everything work so I know

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,220
they're doing a lot of work so if they

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,360
could stand up we can give them a round

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,080
of applause here

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
all right thanks okay so um our I'm

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,400
going to introduce now our next speaker

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,640
the as I said I've been in ACI for about

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,759
five years I'm a computer scientist but

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,799
I've most people think I'm an electrical

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,600
engineer just because I'm I have a ham

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,840
radio license and I do so much on the

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,360
radio I got sucked into this this thing

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
in 2018 when electronic warfare got

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,020
moved over to cyber so NACI as a

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,459
researcher I was working a lot with

46
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,080
trying to understand where we're at with

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,140
ew turns out not not in the best spot

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,060
but we're moving very quickly to get

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,700
much better at it so

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,599
um

51
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,480
uh one great thing that I get to see at

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,700
ACI now being here longer is I get to

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,360
see some of our researchers

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,800
come through get their graduate we pick

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,180
them they go to grad school then they

56
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,680
come through ACI and then they go out

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,660
and do great things in the Army and

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,000
that's exactly who this next speaker is

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
so major Steve whitham uh class of

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,200
2009 so he was here when I first taught

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
boy I'm getting old

62
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,080
um so uh I think probably was a CDX

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,720
person then too right so which we I

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,459
don't even think we'd do that anymore

65
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,640
um the uh he came through and did a lot

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,060
of great work with ACI with a an event

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,940
called Jack voltaic which is now in uh

68
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,640
fm30 it's actually listed in appendix C

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,500
so you could check that out we get a

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,140
little ACI gets a shout out so

71
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,099
um

72
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,800
the uh the exercise was basically

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,480
looking at kind of an infrastructure

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,659
looking at more than just a um a post

75
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,000
and saying okay we can deploy what

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
happens if you leave or what happens if

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
your power gets cut out or what happens

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
if the port is is has been cyber

79
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,300
attacked and looking at the bigger

80
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,000
picture and so he worked on that here at

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,060
ACI but as as you've seen in the past

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,879
few days 17 Alpha 17 Bravo we go back

83
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,019
and forth we have to do different

84
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,300
missions he's now in like a 17 Bravo

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,760
slot so he went from ACI researcher

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,099
looking at infrastructure now looking at

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,260
the Tactical Edge and looking at the

88
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,760
electronic warfare piece of the mission

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,280
so that's what you you have to be

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,799
expected to do as you as you grow

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,260
throughout the branch so with that I'd

92
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,330
like to welcome major Steve whitham

93
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,420
[Applause]

94
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,700

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,759
most of your tables so some of you have

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,500
already discovered that I love to hear

105
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,240
myself talk

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,860
um now you have to listen to me because

107

I'm the program speaker for the next 20

108
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,780

109
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,100
it's a match made in heaven I like I

110
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,360
like to talk and they're giving me the

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,919
opportunity so

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,380
um as Colonel Hamilton mentioned my name

113
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,120
is Major Steve Woodham I am currently

114
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,000
the chief of cyber and electromagnetic

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,060
activities at 10th Mountain division

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,040
um that will be the fifth time in my

117
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,900
life that I have used the full title the

118
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,020
other four times were previous uh table

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,580
discussions that I've had here in this

120
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,500
room because nobody says that full

121
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,620
acronym it's just Seema but

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,320
uh what does that mean means that first

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
and foremost I am the principal advisor

124
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,740
for all things cyber and electronic

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,100
warfare for uh the CG the Commanding

126
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,580
General of 10th Mountain Division

127
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,400
and my section is responsible for

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,320
coordinating electronic warfare assets

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,060
from Joint Forces and the organic assets

130
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,639
that we have in tense Mountain division

131
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,680
in a large-scale combat operation or

132
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,580
lisco fight as part of what is now a

133
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,240
multi-domain operations

134
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,580
prior to that

135
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,979
even before coming over to uh to being a

136
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,380
cyber officer in a former life I was an

137
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,100
MI officer and I was the last

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,919
sigint platoon leader in the army

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,639
to have spent time in a Recon Squadron

140
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,479
so when sigint what took over the role

141
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,539
of electronic warfare for the Army there

142
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,699
was a transition that was made over the

143
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,919
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to move

144
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,639
sigint from the Tactical into the into

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,639
the Mico and at the Brigade combat teams

146
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,940
that that mission uh sustained but the

147
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
the transition meant that we were no

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,100
longer aligned directly underneath the

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,479
the calf

150
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,360
so I got a chance to actually do for all

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,300
you 17 Bravo aspiring lieutenants I got

152
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,360
a chance to do tactical electronic

153
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,919
support before I even knew that it was

154
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,660
electronic support we called it tactical

155
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,400
segant

156
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,139
um but it's it's essentially the same

157
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,639
Mission so I'm going to be speaking a

158
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,880
little bit this morning about

159
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,440
what

160
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,240
your responsibilities are going to be as

161
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,360
a 17 Bravo platoon leader

162
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,220
um but I have to start off by saying

163
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,660
that just about everybody yesterday took

164
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,340

165
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,440

price you uh you covered most of what I

167
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,699
had intended to speak about so I'm going

168
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,100
to shift a little bit towards kind of

169
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,340
what I do specifically

170
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,479
how tenth Mountain views the upcoming

171
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,580
environment and the types of engagements

172
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,960
that 10th Mountain expects to be

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,539
involved in and how we see cyber and

174
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,340
electromagnetic activities playing a

175
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,620
role in that and particularly how

176
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,240
electronic warfare is going to play a

177
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,060
role in that so let me start with a

178
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,900
little bit of what I see the future of

179
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,880
electronic warfare and and large-scale

180
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,639
combat operations being last 20 years

181
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,440
Iraq and Afghanistan we've been involved

182
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,680
in a counterinsurgency or coin fight

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,860
second ew very individual targeting

184
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,539
focused trying to build a pattern of

185
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,819
life on a Target trying to identify you

186
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,280
know who they are where they are how

187
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,800
they operate so that we can find them

188
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,599
and kill them

189
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,300
the basic principles are the same but

190
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,300
the targets change in a large-scale

191
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,819
combat operation I no longer care about

192
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,560
the individual and no longer care even

193
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,840
about

194
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,979
from a targeting perspective at the

195
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,000
division level I don't I don't really

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
care about platoons

197
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
what I care about are the things that

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,419
are going to help the enemy find me and

199
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,000
kill me and in particular what I as a

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
SEMA officer care about is helping the

201
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,979
targeting officer identify and Target

202
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,259
and kill the things that the commander

203
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,919
wants Dead first in order of priority we

204
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,660
would see something like counter battery

205
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,599
radar how does that work well

206
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,620
you you fire from a firing Point

207
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,880
artillery rounds and a counter battery

208
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,339
radar is going to track the trajectory

209
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,279
of that projectile back to the the

210
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,260
source

211
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,240
what can you do once you know where the

212
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,760
source of that fire is

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,800
well you can lay rounds On Target and

214
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,019
you can do so pretty accurately so

215
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,260
counter battery radar is a high

216
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,000
payoff Target it's a high priority

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,279
Target

218
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,019
air defense integrated air defense

219
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,420
systems again radars

220
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,140
why do we care about those well for any

221
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,180
tactical formation the combat Aviation

222
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,680
Brigade is the most lethal element

223
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,740
in in that formation the amount of pain

224
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,899
that an Apache can strap on the

225
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,200
underside and deliver is something quite

226
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,820
spectacular

227
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
there is nothing more lethal than the

228
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,200
cab but they are vulnerable

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,899
so you want to protect them by

230
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,779
preventing the enemy from using their

231
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,600
integrated air defense systems

232
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,899
from tracking and shooting down

233
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,060
your combat Aviation Brigade elements

234
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,700
the third priority

235
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,279
and these depending on the the time of

236
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,540
the operation these are interchangeable

237
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,300
these top three priorities are enemy ISR

238
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
in intelligence surveillance and

239
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,140
reconnaissance assets

240
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,500
a lot of this is unmanned aerial systems

241
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,800
drones right and especially more

242
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,360
recently what we're seeing is a

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,220
proliferation of what are called group

244
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,880
one or category one

245
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,860
uas's these are quadcopters these are

246
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,480
commercial off the shelf 50 to 200

247
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,220
dollars

248
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,920
um with good cameras quadcopters I mean

249
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,420
if any of you are watching you know

250
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,660
modern vloggers fly their their their uh

251
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,760
their drones and take you know these

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
high quality pictures

253
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,180
there's some military application to

254
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,019
that

255
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,839
right it is not cost effective to fire a

256
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,519
ten thousand dollar round

257
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,040
at a 50 quadcopter

258
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
this is not a thing

259
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,300
right they're much better targets for

260
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,060
those expensive Munitions so

261
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,540
how do we combat those right in those

262
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,040
top three priorities what have I not

263
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
listed

264
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,820
individuals platoons

265
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,560
the type of targeting that we have seen

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
in counter Insurgency what have I talked

267
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,600
about I have talked about systems that

268
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,920
rely on

269
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,620
the EMS the electromagnetic spectrum for

270
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,360
communication and operation

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,839
Radars in particular emit an incredibly

272
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,420
loud and bright signal they have to

273
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,360
because that signal has to bounce off of

274
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,820
something in the air and return

275
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,740
with a sufficient signal strength for

276
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,720
the radar to identify and track whatever

277
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
that is that it that it bounced off of

278
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,920
it's a very strong signal which means it

279
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,040
can be detected from very far away

280
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,480
so that's

281
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,120
the type of targeting that that we do

282
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,760
that I'm that I'm responsible for

283
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,279
providing input to the staff since

284
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,839
Mountain division recently went through

285
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,399
it was actually before I arrived at 10th

286
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
Mountain division through what's called

287
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
a Warfighter the Warfighter is a

288
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,220
division level staff exercise where

289
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,779
you're doing a force on Force engagement

290
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,480
right General officers

291
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,240
give orders staff's plan and then the

292
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,600
simulator

293
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,220
through its algorithm determines what

294
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,620
the results are each day and you're

295
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,420
doing a force on Force engagement at a

296
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,959
core level

297
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,019
10th Mountain division was wildly

298
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,200
successful with its SEMA efforts to

299
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,300
create what in multi-domain operations

300
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,399
is called a convergence window

301
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,380
the convergence window is when you are

302
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,480
able to align all of your assets to

303
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,480
create a particular window of time could

304
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,519
be two hours could be a day

305
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,279
where you can have maximal impact

306
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,399
and create for your adversary multiple

307
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,500
dilemmas multiple decisions that they

308
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,260
have to to make you're so successful in

309
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,860
the Warfighter in fact that in two hours

310
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,540
we completely eliminated all of the

311
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,920
enemy sophisticated integrated air

312
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,699
defense systems

313
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,380
and in order to make the game continue

314
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,160
to be challenging the uh the the

315
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,660
civilians reconstituted all of the air

316
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,279
defense they cheated and they brought it

317
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,420
all back

318
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,399
they had to because otherwise the game

319
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,660
was going to be too easy from that point

320
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,820
forward

321
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,620
fast forward four months I finally

322
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,260
arrived and we're playing a higher

323
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,360
command now for third infantry division

324
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,180
as they go through their Warfighter

325
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,519
and we did it again

326
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
even though we went into the the menu of

327
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,860
items and said and and they had

328
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,779
explicitly prevented

329
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,120
what my warrant officer did to them last

330
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
time

331
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,060
but we found another way to create that

332
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,740
same convergence window and once again

333
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,139
as the higher headquarters blow up all

334
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,620
of the enemy air defense systems

335
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,200
and they had to reconstitute again

336
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,019
and we weren't even the target audience

337
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,519
they had to do it for third ID so the

338
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,899
third ID could go through their paces

339
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,880
and actually have the challenge so 10th

340
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,200
Mountain division leadership actually

341
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,540
gets what is at least possible now I

342
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,019
will say about this the sim a lot of

343
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,060
this is white carded we were way more

344
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,320
effective than we would actually have

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,579
been in reality

346
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,200
but that's better than being less

347
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
effective

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,959
but the point is that the leadership

349
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,880
across the Army is really starting to

350
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,820
come to appreciate what electronic

351
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,040
warfare can bring on the modern

352
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,079
Battlefield they're coming beginning to

353
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,060
appreciate it not because necessarily of

354
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
what we did in the warsim they're

355
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,339
appreciating it because of what's going

356
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,120
on in Ukraine

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,040
but they don't understand it yet

358
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,380
and that's where we come in

359
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,480
but at least you're going to have a

360
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,279
commander that wants to know

361
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,459
and so challenge number one for all of

362
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,959
you lieutenants whether you're an alpha

363
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,760
or Bravo is

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm going to just repeat what previous

365
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,240
speakers have said you have to know your

366
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,420
stuff

367
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,860
now 10th Mountain has a few challenges

368
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:46,680
um

369
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,899
we are presently at 3 out of 15 officers

370
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,940
three officers for the 15 authorizations

371
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,660
in 10th Mountain

372
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,880
pretty soon I will be leaving it's a

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,380
different story and there will be

374
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,240
another officer another o4 who's leaving

375
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,139
and

376
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,139
as things stand right now the senior 17

377
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,880
and 10th Mountain Division come

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,380
September is going to be an O2

379
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,160
Manning is a challenge

380
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,639
things hopefully will improve as you

381
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,100
matriculate out to the force but

382
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,800
you're joining a branch

383
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,260
that is under strength

384
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,959
and in high demand and in particular ew

385
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,620
very under strength and in high demand

386
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,980
okay

387
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,139
what I need from the you future

388
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,639
lieutenants is this

389
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,120
you need to be able to step up two ranks

390
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,339
because it's entirely possible that you

391
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,079
may find yourself going to a brigade

392
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,260
combat team and there's no o4 filling

393
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,699
the o4 spot

394
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,320
and you may be pulled up to staff

395
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,060
because that's where the Brigade

396
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,180
Commander feels you can be best utilized

397
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,360
you may dual hat as the platoon leader

398
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,880
and do staff time while you're leading

399
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,440
your formation

400
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,660
that's

401
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,480
that's a real possibility

402
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,220
so

403
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,779
how are you going to lead that formation

404
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,399
you've heard previous guest speakers say

405
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,199
I need you to be competent

406
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,519
need you to lead

407
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,899
need you to understand troop leading

408
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,760
procedures need you to take care of your

409
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
people all of that is true

410
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
my challenge to you is

411
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,760
you need to be better

412
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,980
than your peers in other branches

413
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,740
it's on top of everything else you need

414
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,199
to know multi-domain operations you need

415
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,199
to know FM 5-0 operational terms and

416
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,759
Graphics you need to be able to explain

417
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,060
what you mean when you say destroy

418
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,519
or deny disruptor grade

419
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,259
or manipulate

420
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,000
you need to be able to speak in those

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,040
terms because that is the language of

422
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,520
our profession

423
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,579
and not all the lieutenants in the other

424
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,339
branches actually have to speak in those

425
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,599
terms

426
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,660
outside of their own Branch until they

427
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,939
hit staff planning level until they hit

428
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,459
even sometimes joint

429
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,959
okay

430
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,679
so I need you to be better than

431
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,220
need you to continue to earn your place

432
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,900
in this competitive branch that you

433
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,580
selected into and

434
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,960
it's a hard Branch to get into

435
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,400
now for those of you who are going to be

436
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
17 Bravos I want to explain a little bit

437
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
about what the modern Battlefield is

438
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,179
going to look like we've talked a little

439
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,679
bit about targeting

440
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,980
but the division is going back to so the

441
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,299
Army is transitioning back to the

442
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,160
division being the unit of action right

443
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,380
used to be the over-the-counter

444
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,480
Insurgency we we made the Brigade combat

445
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,580
teams the unit of action meant that all

446
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,260
the assets that were that the commander

447
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,780
needed were pushed down to that level

448
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,760
it's coming back Army's going to

449
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,520
transition back to the division so that

450
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,740
brigades infantry brigades are going to

451
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,419
be maneuver elements again they will

452
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,440
still have assets but most of the

453
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,700
capabilities are going to be held and

454
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
apportioned out from the division level

455
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,620
which means

456
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,100
presumably by the time you all hit hit

457
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,380
ground your platoons are going to be a

458
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,220
division asset you can be C2

459
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,480
um

460
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,240
through the collection manager and

461
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,320
probably going to be working in

462
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
coordination with

463
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,100
Recon elements again Scouts

464
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,340
the the world is more dangerous now for

465
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,340
electronic warfare soldiers than it was

466
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,900
even

467
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,200
12 years ago when I was a lieutenant

468
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,480
a few things have changed the enemy now

469
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,740
has ground surveillance radar

470
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,179
it's a radar that's angled downward and

471
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,200
it can track foot traffic foot movement

472
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,860
enemy has these group one uas's the the

473
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,580
quadcopters the the cheap systems

474
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,679
we didn't face an adversary that was

475
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,020
making a lot of effective use of that

476
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,780
over the last 20 years

477
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,480
enemy is also going to have electronic

478
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,679
warfare

479
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,360
capabilities

480
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,820
Taliban Al-Qaeda the insurgents that

481
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,559
we've been facing the last 20 years they

482
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
just didn't have anything to speak of

483
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,539
right you are the Hunter and you are The

484
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,900
Hunted

485
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,880
back when I was a pl we had this term

486
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,620
for insignant called low-level voice

487
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,820
intercept

488
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,980
uh that it was a four-person team

489
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,160
carrying we had a system called a prd13

490
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
it was a 1980s 1970s era piece of

491
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,559
technology still quite effective to be

492
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,520
honest

493
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,039
but the thing weighed across four four

494
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,600
people 55 pounds

495
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,539
oh okay Carrie 15 pounds a person that's

496
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,240
not too bad well

497
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,220
the mission was to be able to go out 20

498
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,660
kilometers in front of the forward line

499
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,700
of troops just inside of friendly

500
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,740
artillery range so that you could have

501
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,500
cover in case you needed to retrograde

502
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,220
and self-sustain for 72 to 96 hours

503
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,380
suddenly that 55 pound piece of

504
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,660
equipment is not my limiting factor now

505
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
I'm carrying ammunition

506
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,280
800 rounds for the saw 210 rounds per

507
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,919
person for the m4s that you're carrying

508
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,080
now I'm carrying four days supply of

509
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,419
food and water and carrying shelter I'm

510
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,280
carrying batteries I'm carrying solar

511
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,860
panels I'm carrying eTools I'm carrying

512
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,780
100 pounds a piece 100 pounds of

513
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,880
equipment per Soldier and I have to hump

514
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,260
it 12 miles up and down Hills

515
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,179
one man's personal opinion I don't

516
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,799
really care that much about your acft

517
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,760
score

518
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,520
but if you're gonna be a platoon leader

519
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,500
for a team like that you better be able

520
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,820
to rock

521
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,500
because you better understand what your

522
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,760
soldiers are going to have to be able to

523
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,780
do

524
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,760
if they are called to perform a mission

525
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,100
similar to that

526
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,260
now there's some debate as to whether

527
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,960
that is going to be the the future of

528
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,880
dismanted operations

529
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,679
but if you're going to a light unit you

530
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,480
may not have vehicles and you may need

531
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,880
to go out to a location to be the eyes

532
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,280
and ears of the commander

533
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,900
that's out front

534
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,000
and your most casualty producing weapon

535
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,080
system

536
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,440
is a squad automatic weapon

537
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,460
it's an incredibly dangerous job

538
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,900
that your soldiers are going to have to

539
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,640
perform

540
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,200
and if you have to see to it as a

541
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
platoon leader

542
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,220
coordinating multiple teams in order to

543
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,780
get multiple lines of bearings in order

544
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,520
to produce that fix for targeting

545
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,620
purposes

546
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,260
it's a lot of very precious Talent

547
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,840
that's being put in very dangerous

548
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,880
places

549
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,159
and you have to know what that's going

550
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,720
to be like

551
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,520
and be able to articulate that

552
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,520
capability to the commander

553
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,520
so your responsibility up is to make

554
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
sure that your higher headquarters knows

555
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,039
what you're capable of performing

556
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,440
it means you cannot sugar coat it

557
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,140
the responsibility down is to train your

558
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
soldiers well enough that they can

559
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,539
survive that mission

560
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,799
you need to take care of them you need

561
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,480
to take care of their families

562
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,679
and you need to make sure that they're

563
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,700
ready to perform a mission like that

564
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,440
because

565
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,620
we don't know what the next conflict is

566
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,539
going to look like

567
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,780
the Army has relied on joint assets for

568
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,120
its electronic warfare capabilities for

569
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,220
a long time

570
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,620
we've had the luxury of being able to

571
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,240
rely on the Air Force for a system

572
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,280
called a compass call it's an incredibly

573
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,860
powerful electronic warfare Suite

574
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,440
and it's flies in a C-130

575
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
C-130 is not nimble

576
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,539
but we were facing an adversary that had

577
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,500
no

578
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,220
counter heir to speak of so it could fly

579
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,100
permissive easy

580
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,299
it's not going to be the case

581
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,280
necessarily against

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,740
a near-appear threat with actual air

583
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,580
defense capability or an Air Force

584
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,100
so the first couple of months we may be

585
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,980
fighting in

586
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,220
a a capable adversary without the joint

587
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,080
assets that we had previously become

588
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
reliant on

589
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,760
may very well be that your platoon is

590
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
the electronic warfare capability

591
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,140
allocated to that Brigade or that

592
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,340
division

593
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,500
for the first couple of months

594
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,120
that's what I need you to be ready for

595
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,080
any questions so far

596
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,860
go ahead

597
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,120
good morning sir good morning

598
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,980
you mentioned about the enemy having

599
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,159
Advanced artillery

600
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
weapon systems where The Radars are

601
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,860
really loud we can detect different

602
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,440
models away yeah and we ourselves we

603
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,600
have our own systems so what steps have

604
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,020
we taken to mask our signals so that the

605
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,820
enemy does not necessarily get to see

606
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,799
them or detect them yeah no that's a

607
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,500
great question so

608
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,780
10th Mountain we're running a training

609
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,179
iteration we're calling Hunter EMS and

610
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,640
and it's getting after specifically that

611
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,780
question

612
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,299
the basic setup is we've got electronic

613
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,679
warfare teams that are out trying to

614
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,020
find The Radars and the radar techs are

615
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,220
out with their pieces of equipment

616
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,140
trying to gain get an air picture

617
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,900
without being seen

618
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,240
they're learning how to do that and so

619
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,620
far they have been quite successful

620
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,659
actually in evading our ability to find

621
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,980
them with the pieces of equipment that

622
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,780
we have hoping to fix that when that man

623
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,980
comes and brings a little bit better

624
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,880
piece of equipment next week right

625
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,020
um

626
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,659
the Army as previously mentioned does

627
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,720
not have any program of record equipment

628
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,360
right now and most of the really good

629
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,140
equipment that we have is or not the

630
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,580
entire Army but 10th Mountain does not

631
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,900
have any currently fielded program of

632
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,320
record equipment and clarify that

633
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,880
what we do have though are systems that

634
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,380
were built for a counterinsurgency fight

635
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,380
right most of those frequency range 20

636
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,960
megahertz up to about six gigahertz so

637
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,480
you can cover the top end Wi-Fi and all

638
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,320
of that well some of these systems and

639
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,580
what we're training on is our own

640
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,740
systems

641
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,900
we allocated we got spectrum allocation

642
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,500
for them between 9 and 9.5 gigahertz

643
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,179
so

644
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,400
if you have a system that can sense up

645
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,620
to six gigahertz and you have an emitter

646
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,460
that's

647
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,279
producing signals at nine gigahertz you

648
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,679
have a math problem

649
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,480
so we're having to bring out other

650
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,919
pieces of equipment

651
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,320
and some of those are

652
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,760
good

653
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,020
in

654
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,880
the Eastern European like terrain of

655
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,100
Fort Drum with the snow and The Rock and

656
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,299
the trees

657
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,940
some of them are really good at The

658
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,220
Proving Grounds where they're getting an

659
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,159
elevated position and it's desert

660
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,220
they're not necessarily the same system

661
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,500
but to get your to actually answer your

662
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,039
question the radar texts are starting to

663
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,659
figure out

664
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,120
how long it takes when they emit before

665
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,559
they get found

666
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,500
and they're turning off and moving

667
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,539
we actually had during uh when we were

668
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,179
playing icon we actually had a rotating

669
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,039
General officer come into to guest

670
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,299
command

671
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,580
and our counter battery warrant officer

672
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,080
said hey you know sir we're going to do

673
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,640
this queuing schedule we're going to

674
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,580
have this q64 turn on get Air picture

675
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,679
emit for about five minutes and then

676
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,760
it's going to turn off and then this

677
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,440
one's going to turn on and get air

678
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,360
picture while that other one moves and

679
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,100
then

680
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,240
the third one's going to turn on the

681
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,380
second one's going to turn off and then

682
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,340
that one's going to move and we're just

683
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,200
going to keep moving around our Radars

684
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,900
so we contain we continue to get 100 air

685
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,820
picture

686
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,039
but none of our systems are in place

687
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,320
long enough to be targeted

688
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,539
it's an old TTP

689
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,940
we're relearning old stuff with new

690
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,380
systems

691
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,720
but he'd never heard of that before

692
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,279
and frankly neither had I prior to

693
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,679
coming to 10th mountain right but there

694
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,120
are also things like site selection

695
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,240
right so if you when you go to the

696
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,620
qualification course you're going to

697
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,820
find out about something called a side

698
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,360
lobe that radar is looking up and out

699
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,179
but because of how the physics of Ian

700
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,179
emissions Works you're going to get

701
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,820
the the what's called a side lobe off

702
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,520
the side and down

703
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,600
and you'll be able to detect those as

704
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
well so even though the it's radiating

705
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,260
up and out you're still going to be able

706
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,600
to detect it down now the side lobes

707
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,299
were like 10 million times the strength

708
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,980
of the Sun

709
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,320
locally right so the sun's definitely

710
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,580
more powerful than the radar don't get

711
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,559
me wrong right but by the time the the

712
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,360
the

713
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,400
radiation the the emission reaches us

714
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,919
it's usually sitting at around negative

715
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
130 decibels and and we were picking

716
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,419
them up at at around negative 60

717
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,940
decibels

718
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,580
every 10 decibels is a factor of 10 for

719
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,940
power level so that's

720
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,020
what 10 to the 7th 10 to the eighth I'm

721
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,960
math in public it's not a good idea but

722
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,360
it's still very very loud right

723
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,059
so and that's off the side lobe so it

724
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,740
was a genuine question to the commander

725
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,679
is it worth turning this asset on

726
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,840
to maintain an air picture

727
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,539
because you can be found

728
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,940
and you can be targeted so when is it

729
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,779
worth turning it on

730
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,640
and how long do you leave it on

731
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,220
right we're figuring this stuff out

732
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,080
and that's what you all will be

733
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,400
responsible for doing is help us

734
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,799
continue to evolve our understanding of

735
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,659
what ew and the modern environment looks

736
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,779
like

737
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,059
it used to be just turn the radar on and

738
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,559
it's fine

739
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,179
they don't have the ability to find it

740
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,380
and if they did they wouldn't have the

741
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,840
ability to kill it

742
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,520
not the same anymore it's a good

743
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,360
question

744
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,860
any what other questions

745
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,440
sir

746
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,440
so with uh cyber officers having a

747
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
larger effect in a tactical environment

748
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,500
like you were explaining where you have

749
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
to go out and be the eyes and ears of

750
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,740
the commander

751
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,480
do you think that they may start

752
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,260
prioritizing more of those uh positions

753
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,140
and authorizations for the 17 Bravos and

754
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,960
divisions like the 10th mountain or the

755
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
third infantry

756
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,260
do I think that they will sir you want

757
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,799
to take that one

758
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,779
hey so Brian vile and uh actually have

759
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,279
three different jobs so one of them has

760
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,659
commandant of the cyber school the other

761
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,299
one is chief of cyber so 100 of that

762
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,940
answer is on me so every year what we do

763
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,919
actually twice a year I go to the

764
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,600
general Barrett who's the r cyber

765
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,580
Commander she's my three star level top

766
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,539
cover

767
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,240
and so for all of the billets across the

768
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,520
United States Army what we do is we

769
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,520
generate an bi-annual memo that's

770
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,039
aligned with what we call the aim cycle

771
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,080
it's what everybody else uses except for

772
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,020
you know new entry soldiers uh that says

773
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,360
what are the priorities for the Army So

774
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,580
within the Force com formations within

775
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,260
the Tactical armies the cores the

776
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,600
divisions and everything else what we do

777
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,580
is we look to the four-star Commander

778
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,100
that owns that mission we literally ask

779
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,980
the forcecom commander to say what are

780
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,960
your priorities and then we will execute

781
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,299
them on your behalf so a hundred percent

782
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,120
of the prioritization for the 17 B's and

783
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,380
where they're going to go for the force

784
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,600
comes directly from the operational

785
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,179
force and we simply execute that on

786
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,740
their behalf so does that answer the

787
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,919
question

788
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,840
thank you sir

789
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,740
any other questions

790
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,760
good morning

791
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,700
how do we invest

792
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,919
in ncos who might have

793
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,640
or needs

794
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,039
okay so the question was uh

795
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,539
understanding that there's a shortage of

796
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,279
officers how do we best prepare the

797
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,440
warrants and ncos

798
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,179
um

799
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,159
so there's a similar shortage of

800
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,500
warrants I think the enlisted side is a

801
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,320
little bit healthier the schoolhouse is

802
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,220
producing as many qualified soldiers as

803
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,399
they can

804
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,380
the best way that you can prepare your

805
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,840
warrants is to get out of their way and

806
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,678
let them be warrants

807
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,360
so I am blessed with a cw3 who could do

808
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,059
my job way better than I do

809
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,240
I can't do his job

810
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,940
nearly as well as he can but I can do my

811
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,059
job

812
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,760
as an officer do officer things

813
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,279
let your warrants do warrant things if

814
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,320
they are required to fill your role that

815
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,360
you're capable of doing so but they

816
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,340
really have better things to do than

817
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,879
your job

818
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,340
north south from the warrants in the

819
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,120
room okay

820
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,120
that's a good question

821
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,340
sir how much or what's the collaboration

822
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,320
like working with either like Mir signal

823
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,880
in terms of the type of plans they're

824
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,899
putting together improve into the

825
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,600
commanders yeah no great great question

826
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,179
um so it depends on on the operation

827
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,799
when we were going through our war fight

828
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,840
so Warfighter really is the time where

829
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,460
you where you start smoothing out those

830
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,500
staff processes

831
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,840
um outside of that you're you're kind of

832
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,519
in your own Lanes you know you're

833
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,380
training your your folks but that's

834
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,500
that's the Warfighter or an NTC rotation

835
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,179
those collective training events that's

836
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,860
really where you get the opportunity to

837
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,260
to practice this

838
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,059
um we have a wonderful working

839
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,519
relationship with the two section the

840
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,019
SEMA and

841
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,559
um and the G2 and the collection manager

842
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,840
um some of the things that we did in the

843
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Warfighter we actually armed one of the

844
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
collection managers

845
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,679
ISR assets with a Hellfire

846
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,940
and the collection manager got to kill

847
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,899
stuff

848
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,599
which was fun for an Intel Soldier for

849
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,780
an Intel officer

850
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,520
you're going to work hand in hand right

851
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,719
so right now I there are a number of

852
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,280
working groups that are that are going

853
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,899
on at the division that I would love to

854
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,580
be a part of I have to prioritize

855
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,960
because I just don't have the people to

856
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,239
send to all of them targeting is is

857
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,918
number one

858
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,899
the ipb process the intelligence

859
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,580
preparation of the battlefield just

860
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,500
don't have the bodies for to to have

861
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,940
them be part because that's a that's an

862
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,800
ongoing continual process it would it

863
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,440
would subsume an entire uh Two Soldiers

864
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,080
actual time to make it work and I just

865
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,780
don't have that that number but when we

866
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,179
get into the targeting meetings

867
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,560
and we're getting into the what are

868
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,540
called the targeting working groups

869
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,880
outline here here's where we think the

870
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,560
enemy is here's what the high priority

871
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,660
targets are how are we going to get

872
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,160
after them that's when we all get

873
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,780
together and like okay that's how we're

874
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,119
going to kill it and it's lethal what do

875
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,160
you got non-lethal what do you got right

876
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,780
and we build these the plans together

877
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,980
all of us in the room collaborating and

878
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,740
I will I will tell you that as a staff

879
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,820
officer

880
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,480
the best way to be effective and to

881
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,800
build the relationship with your fellow

882
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,480
staff officers is to take work off of

883
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,339
other people's plates

884
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,320
if you are competent and able to perform

885
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,359
your mission and able to solve their

886
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,800
problems

887
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,320
they will love you forever

888
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,180
if on the other hand you cause them

889
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,700
problems or because you're not doing

890
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,800
your job you're making them have to work

891
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,880
harder

892
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,940
you'll be ostracized

893
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,220
immediately

894
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,020
I think that's probably just generally

895
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,300
true but it's especially true

896
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,119
at an organization that has to move and

897
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,160
move shoot and communicate

898
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,040
on a continual basis that quickly

899
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,060
um

900
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,579
the maneuver folks want to hear from you

901
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:09,660
as long as you have something to

902
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,859
contribute

903
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,599
if you don't have anything to contribute

904
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,940
stay silent until you have something to

905
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,359
contribute

906
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,400
does that answer your question okay

907
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,960
great questions these are fantastic

908
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,280
questions what else

909
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,820
all right

910
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,180
so I will close with my expectations for

911
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,520
for the lieutenants right

912
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,920
all of that competence leadership troop

913
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,320
leading procedures all of that still

914
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
valid

915
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,859
you're going to be in a position where

916
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,359
because you are high demand and low

917
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,040
density you're going to have to be more

918
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,000
expert at things that sooner

919
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,720
than your your peers in other branches

920
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,700
it's just it's just the nature of being

921
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,920
part of a branch that that is is so

922
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,079
short and such high demand

923
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,079
so I need you to dig into FM 3-0 I need

924
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,480
you to dig into FM 5-0 need you to

925
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,079
understand ATP 3-12.3 and I really need

926
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,240
you to bring up ATP 3-12.4

927
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,400
electronic warfare platoons

928
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,440
that is your Baseline

929
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,180
for how you will lead your platoon

930
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,560
formations

931
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,880
then

932
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,400
I need you to train and practice with

933
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,540
the units that you're going to be

934
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,880
supporting so you can take your ttps

935
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,859
your tactics techniques and procedures

936
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,740
and blend them with the supported units

937
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,060
because the other thing that you will

938
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,700
end up finding is that if you per if you

939
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,740
prove to be a battlefield liability to

940
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,839
the units that you're supporting they

941
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,040
will not take you with them

942
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,520
and you will have gone through all of

943
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,300
your training and you'll be

944
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,260
operationally useless

945
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,180
cyber is a team sport

946
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,859
multi-domain operations is a team of

947
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,520
teams sport

948
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,700
you play into everything

949
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,300
you're connected with everything

950
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,280
relies in some part on you and you rely

951
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,900
on some part on everything else you have

952
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,500
to understand a more holistic picture

953
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,079
in order to be most effective so I need

954
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,940
you to be better I need you to be fitter

955
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,619
and I need you to lead

956
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,400
your people

957
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,570
thank you

958
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:39,109
[Applause]
