1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,559
all right so I know that the focus of

2
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,240
this conference is on the the junior

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,340
leaders but we were super fortunate also

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,080
to get General vile and general Stanton

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,640
to come in for this

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,020
um two of the most passionate General

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,939
officers I know in cyber

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,119
um so General vile is the um the Cyber

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,000
commandant uh the fifth cyber commandant

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,279
and uh he is

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,680
right right here okay so

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,420
um he'll be coming up to give us a

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,040
speech and a talk and a motivating

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,379
speech to to get us ready for for this

15
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,360
conference so with that we'll bring him

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,260
up

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,000
[Applause]

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,739
all right check in all right outstanding

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,500
hey good morning hey so there's one one

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,719
group in here that actually hasn't been

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,879
applauded for and so that's all the

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,860
cadets that have successfully branched

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,300
Library one of the most selective

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,400
branches in the United States Army so

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,439
give it up for yourselves and give it up

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,179
for all the future cyber lieutenants

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,280
now I I do want to be 100 clear so I

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,280
went infantry uh so I know the guy that

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,159
was last he was number 173 out of 173

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,560
that got infantry my year he is now a

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,240
general officer so there's hope for all

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
of you uh don't worry about it if you

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,500
were at the bottom of that list uh so

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,439
I'm proof and number 173 is proof as

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,159
well

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,720
so really what I want to talk to you

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,860
today

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,960
next slide

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,939
we're trying to get the technology work

40
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,240
all right here we go okay what is the

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,720
Cyber Corps what is it that we do why is

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,000
it important and then for you well who

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,460
are we what do we want to be when we

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,560
grow up now the way for me to do this

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,479
what I'm going to have to talk about is

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm going to go through the entire

47
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,140
history of warfare now to be fair Brian

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,259
vile got a C in military history so some

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,640
of the facts in here might be a little

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,320
bit shaky but that's okay you know

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,639
nobody's going to question me today it's

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,139
a beautiful thing

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,800
so in a in a place far far away and in

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,760
time long long ago

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
next slide there we go

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,620
in infantryman name Kane took his

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,420
bayonet inserted it between the second

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,099
and third rib of a man named Mabel

59
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,200
twisted and in PB came

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,680
the first infantryman and so began the

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
beginning of warfare and way back then

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
in the beginning of warfare you know it

63
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,379
was just one-on-one well what ended up

64
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,780
happening was we very rapidly decided

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,480
the upscale operations and so now

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,340
instead of man on man instead of

67
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,400
individual combat which you had was

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,920
armies you had large groups of people

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
and the challenge that quickly arose for

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,540
the commanders on the battlefield was

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,540
how do you command and control this how

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,459
do you give guidance and direction to

73
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,140
the soldiers on the field

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,580
and if you think about it we didn't have

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,680
cell phones what did they use they used

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,560
horns they used bugle calls they use

77
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,540
guidance they use colors they use

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,980
standards

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,200
and why did they do this because the

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,900
commander visually had the look and he

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,760
had to see what was going on on the

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,980
battlefield you had to wear colorful

83
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,739
uniform so you could understand who was

84
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,659
yours who was the adversary and even

85
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,239
with your own formations where were the

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,800
officers where were the Infantry where

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,659
were the dragoons because they all

88
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,280
served different purposes and the only

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
way to effectively command and control

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,700
was visually

91
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,739
and you needed these guidance you needed

92
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,180
these standards and you needed something

93
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,760
called a runner in order to go out and

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,099
deliver messages on the battlefield you

95
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,720
know we wanted the questions last night

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
you know who here's run a marathon what

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,980
was the guy that ran the marathon why

98
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,900
did he run the marathon it was a

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,659
military messenger and so always from

100
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,220
the beginning the military has had this

101
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,440
challenge of command and control on the

102
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
battlefield

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,980
now time went on and on and then

104
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,620
eventually we hit the Civil War

105
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,560
and during the Civil War and this gets

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
back to the importance of academics

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,540
within our branch in particular Dr major

108
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,760
Albert Meyer he stood up the signal

109
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,699
Corps and for the Union forces on the

110
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,220
battlefield they did have telegraphs you

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,779
know but you had to physically spool the

112
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,520
wire the wire would break the batteries

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
were unreliable so generally you were

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,419
mostly using these four strategic and

115
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,520
operational level messaging you know

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
because this is infrastructure this is

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,000
difficult to run particularly in combat

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,060
particularly on a fluid Battlefield and

119
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,060
so what he developed was the wig wags so

120
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,380
if you've ever seen or you know somebody

121
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,699
from The Signal Court those aren't

122
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,199
semaphores that they're wearing they're

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
actually called wig wags and it was

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
developed by a union officer and the

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,900
ability to communicate on the

126
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,120
battlefield was one of the things that

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,979
gave the Union Army The Edge over the

128
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,560
Confederates during the Civil War

129
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,160
was it ideal no did it work in in during

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,199
that time absolutely it was the best

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
thing that we had

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
so history goes on and we hit this thing

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,220
called The Second Industrial Revolution

134
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
the first Industrial Revolution was the

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,639
steam engine Second Industrial

136
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,919
revolutions really what led us into

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,740
modern warfare it brought us the

138
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,900
internal combustion engine which allowed

139
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,020
for tanks it brought us machine guns it

140
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,660
brought us Mass manufacture of Munitions

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,800
it bought us smokeless powder

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,860
it's what brought us Aviation 1903 with

143
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,720
the Wright brothers the first casualty

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,820
in an aircraft was actually an army

145
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,460
officer an army signal officer at that

146
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,139
and it was advances in field or

147
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,120
artillery the Chinese may have invented

148
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,680
gunpowder but it was the French that

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,020
designed a recoilless Canon that you

150
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
could fire on the battlefield and didn't

151
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,160
have to fully reset every time

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,979
and so all the trappings of what we now

153
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,699
know as Modern Warfare really most of

154
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,560
them came immediately out of that Second

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Industrial Revolution it was a huge

156
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
watershed moment

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,020
but what about Communications

158
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,419
so the challenge was

159
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,060
modern Communications words and in its

160
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,960
infancy

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,180
had we figured out radio had Marconi

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,400
figured out radio yeah he had figured it

163
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,139
out but the original radios when they

164
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,720
put them on an aircraft in 1913 had a

165
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,419
range of 2 000 yards two clicks

166
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,400
not particularly effective on the

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
battlefield

168
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,400
so what did we end up using on the

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,660
battlefield and you'll see some of the

170
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,340
pictures up there up in the top left

171
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
that's guys just carrying big spools of

172
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,360
wire now the important thing to

173
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,699
understand about this wire is it was

174
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,199
wrapped in natural rubber called

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,900
gutta-percha and it just it was made by

176
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,520
the lowest bidder it would break all the

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,160
time and artillery foot traffic Soldier

178
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Falls he grabs it it wouldn't break the

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,199
telegraphs would work when the wires

180
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,520
were there but what's the challenge

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,180
batteries there's no two 110 220 volt up

182
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,039
on the front lines batteries were

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,840
unreliable stuff didn't work and oh by

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
the way the trenches were covered in mud

185
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,620
and muck and everything else so all the

186
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,720
Technical Solutions generally didn't

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,940
work very well particularly going into

188
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,800
the first World War

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
so what did they use for Reliable

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,460
Communications

191
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,039
they use carrier pigeons that literally

192
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
is a carrier pigeon being released from

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,580
the inside of a tank in order to tell

194
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,340
the commander where they're at they use

195
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,479
dogs

196
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,340
they would put a message in a little box

197
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,460
around the around its neck and send it

198
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,900
back and hopefully it didn't run away

199
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,520
hopefully it didn't kill it get killed

200
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,259
and hopefully it would bring the message

201
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,340
back

202
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,400
and they also used Runners Runners were

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,020
an incredibly dangerous profession

204
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,880
because what they had to do was

205
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,460
negotiate the trench line from the rear

206
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,680
areas all the way to the front in order

207
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
to carry a message

208
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,960
so as we roll into World War One all the

209
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,660
trappings of Modern Warfare are there

210
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,960
with the exception of communications it

211
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,780
just hadn't matured to that point

212
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,880
so World War One kicks off the British

213
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,460
get involved next slide

214
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,160
and the British decide they need the

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
relief pressure on the French at the

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,039
Battle of Verdun so in 1916 the British

217
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,720
decide they're going to launch a massive

218
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,460
offensive and it was called the battle

219
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,599
of the song

220
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,060
and what they decided to do was

221
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,979
something slightly different

222
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,840
they wanted to innovate

223
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,940
and so they saw the problem they saw the

224
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,759
problem with command and control so once

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
you went into No Man's Land once you

226
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,659
crossed the barbed wire in between the

227
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,940
trench lines you had no Communications

228
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,979
who here wants to be laying in mud

229
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,500
writing a small message to tie to a

230
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,140
carrier pigeon's leg to send back and

231
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,060
who wants to be the runner that has to

232
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,800
stand up and literally run back under

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,959
machine gun fire with a message

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,519
so the British knew this they had seen

235
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,200
the French failures of Communications on

236
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
the front line and so what the french

237
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,459
this or what the British decided to do

238
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,440
was they were going to do something

239
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,740
called a creeping barrage

240
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,779
so what's a creeping barrage so all

241
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,540
creeping barrages you drop artillery on

242
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,120
the enemy and then what happens is it

243
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,420
shifts back the Infantry moves forward

244
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,519
takes the terrain once they hold the

245
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,320
terrain the artillery shifts again

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,420
infantry moves forward so you're

247
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,240
basically slowly moving the artillery in

248
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,740
front of your forces in order to

249
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,779
maintain cover

250
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,399
now what was the challenge with the

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,519
creeping barrage you still had command

252
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,800
and control difficulties

253
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,839
how do you know that the Infantry

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,060
actually secured the first line of

255
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,019
trenches

256
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,660
and if you shifted the artillery too far

257
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,760
behind the Infantry what would happen is

258
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,279
they would lose all of their support and

259
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,720
then the Germans and the reserve

260
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,100
trenches would be able to come forward

261
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,980
counter-attack and seize the terrain

262
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,440
the British knew this so they put lots

263
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,120
of time and lots of effort into trying

264
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
to develop a finely synchronized battle

265
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,820
plan for the battle of the psalm where

266
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,200
they would be able to seize the German

267
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
trenches

268
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,740
so before this what the British did is

269
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,180
they hammered the Germans it was

270
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
originally planned for six days there

271
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,140
was a day of rain so they ended up Seven

272
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,540
Days Seven Days the king of battle

273
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,300
hammered the German front lines some of

274
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,920
the British commanders were told the

275
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,959
Germans will be dead you'll be able to

276
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,480
walk across that sling arms at no man's

277
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,300
land what they didn't plan for was the

278
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,980
fact that the German were actually in

279
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,680
concrete bunkers that artillery actually

280
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,060
is not particularly effective against

281
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,120
Duggan troops and that all of that rain

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
and all the artillery had turned No

283
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
Man's Land into a swamp it was flooded

284
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,019
concertina wire was everywhere barbed

285
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,019
wire was everywhere and again the German

286
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,140
were still alive in their dugouts

287
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,760
so what happened what were the command

288
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,100
and control tools that they used it's

289
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,720
actually very simple

290
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,640
the British officers had a watch that

291
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,800
was synchronized and Lieutenant vile did

292
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,540
the same thing we would synchronize our

293
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,640
watches to make sure we were all on the

294
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,140
same time

295
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,079
and then at the anointed hour Zero 7 30

296
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,140
on July 1st the British officers blew

297
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,519
their whistles

298
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,560
the British infantry got up out of the

299
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,660
trenches and charged towards across no

300
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,180
man land towards the German front lines

301
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,820
for the first round at zero seven thirty

302
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,700
the artillery shifted rearward to the

303
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,220
German rear trenches

304
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,959
what happened

305
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
well what happened was when the British

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,100
left the trenches the Germans heard that

307
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,440
the artillery had shifted behind them

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,240
they got their machine guns got up into

309
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,740
their fighting positions what was left

310
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,899
of them and they started hosing down the

311
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:37,740
British

312
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,380
so literally on the first set of trench

313
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,839
lines this beautifully well-crafted plan

314
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,380
based on assumptions of forward progress

315
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,660
got thrown into the Four Winds

316
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,579
and what did the artillery continue to

317
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,380
do according to the timetable because of

318
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,140
lack of communications it continued to

319
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,600
shift behind and relax the pressure on

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,579
the Germans who were able to reinforce

321
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,519
the front line and roll back most of the

322
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,839
successes

323
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,180
so for lack of command and control for

324
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,459
lack of communications

325
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,920
what was the reason

326
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,860
this is day one of the battle of the

327
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,640
song

328
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,940
the British lost more killed in one day

329
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,820
than we have lost in 20 years in Iraq

330
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,040
and Afghanistan

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
process that and then remember how small

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,420
of a country Great Britain is and then

333
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,459
how much smaller it was back then

334
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,339
compared to today

335
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,620
17 19

336
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,120
000 killed

337
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,100
most in the first few minutes of the

338
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,339
attack and for what very limited gains

339
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,459
so why it was an inability of the

340
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,019
commanders to leverage the information

341
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,720
that was on the battlefield they didn't

342
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,339
know where they were successful they

343
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,019
didn't know where they were failing they

344
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,700
lacked the communication they lacked the

345
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,899
information

346
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,540
in order to be successful

347
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,000
it wasn't their fault they did the best

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
they could but the communications

349
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,579
technology just wasn't there

350
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,380
so after World War one we roll in the

351
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,880
World War II believe it or not a

352
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,620
standard issue for Signal Corps in World

353
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,260
War II two still included wigwag flags

354
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,540
and carrier pigeons okay go to the next

355
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,500
slide

356
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,360
uh but somewhere in the middle of there

357
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,120
in 1947 bonus points who can identify

358
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,720
what that is

359
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,220
that is the first transistor developed

360
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,980
by Bell labs in 1947.

361
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,560
things started to change technology

362
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,819
started to change

363
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,019
and what ended up happening was the

364
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,639
military started integrating it into

365
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,200
every system

366
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,260
so now what we had going through the 50s

367
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,000
going through the 60s going through the

368
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,940
70s what we had for the first time is we

369
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,320
had weapons that were no longer

370
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,380
traditionally fused we had weapons where

371
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,820
we could program them where we could

372
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,620
guide them where we could Target them

373
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,800
where we could use the EMS the

374
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,300
electromagnetic spectrum in order to

375
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,160
deliver effects on the target

376
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,540
and then what happened

377
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,760
1990

378
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,040
the internet the world wide web and yes

379
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,660
that is actually the original symbol for

380
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,980
the world wide web and oh by the way

381
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,600
this is the year I started at this fine

382
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,700
institution of learning

383
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,420
okay and so what did this launch in 1990

384
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,100
it launched the internet it launched

385
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,959
what you all grew up with it launched

386
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
what I had to learn the hard way as an

387
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
old person okay Facebook Amazon the

388
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,060
cloud all of that was launched in 1990

389
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,240
with the beginning of the World Wide Web

390
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,860
phenomenal and what this really did is

391
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,500
it allowed anyone anywhere in the world

392
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,600
to access information

393
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,880
you guys have no idea how good it is to

394
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
not have to go to the library and try to

395
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,699
check out a book that it turns out

396
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,199
somebody else checked out never returned

397
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,420
two months ago because you can Google it

398
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,040
you can find it

399
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,060
huge massive you know uh just the

400
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,399
ability to get that information

401
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,959
and as we're going through and in the

402
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,800
middle of this something happens 9 11.

403
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,320
and in 2001 we began the war in

404
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,019
Afghanistan and in 2003 we began the war

405
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,160
in Iraq

406
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,699
so one parallel pass you had a military

407
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,720
that was already using the

408
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,600
electromagnetic spectrum that now sees

409
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,760
the capabilities that cyberspace can

410
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,959
provide in the ability to move

411
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,779
information and we're fighting two Wars

412
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,880
for over 20 years

413
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,060
so what did we learn in fighting in Iraq

414
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,740
and Afghanistan

415
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,880
first

416
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,180
the EMS the electromagnetic spectrum

417
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,360
this is how you connect devices this is

418
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,380
how you communicate your cell phones

419
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,180
how is that communicating there's no

420
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,519
wires it's using the electromagnetic

421
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
spectrum in order to communicate

422
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,260
and then what's it doing what on that

423
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,940
physical layer for those that know the

424
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,220
OSI model layer one physical that's the

425
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,839
EMS

426
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,079
what's it doing it's passing information

427
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,519
and so when the wars in Iraq and

428
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,800
Afghanistan what we were able to do was

429
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
take National level assets things that

430
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,720
company commanders Battalion commanders

431
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,279
Brigade commanders division commanders

432
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,380
never would have imagined having seen

433
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,660
when Brian vile was a lieutenant you

434
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,600
were able to push information down to

435
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,940
the lowest level you knew where they

436
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,279
were you knew what they were saying and

437
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,800
you knew how to go after them

438
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,940
the EMS and cyberspace absolutely

439
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,820
drove any of the successes in Iraq and

440
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,199
Afghanistan

441
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,079
but there's one caveat to it

442
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,820
it was an uncontested environment

443
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,680
believe it or not I am not aware of any

444
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
Taliban hackers that delivered a cyber

445
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,500
effect

446
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,600
I don't remember them ever attempting

447
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
any jamming activities other than

448
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,259
blowing up cell phone towers

449
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,540
this was uncontested we were able to

450
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,399
fight in the electromagnetic spectrum

451
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,019
and in cyberspace

452
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,139
without a threat without an adversary

453
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,180
and what was happening while we were in

454
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,639
Iraq and Afghanistan was our adversaries

455
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,079
were paying attention

456
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,359
they were watching us learn those

457
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,119
lessons and what they ended up doing is

458
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,619
they integrated it into their own

459
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,059
militaries

460
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,980
the Chinese have significant em uh ew

461
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,599
electromagnetic Warfare capabilities the

462
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,959
Russians have significant mostly had now

463
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,059
uh had significant electromagnetic

464
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,760
Warfare capabilities and they both have

465
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,280
incredible cyber actors you know

466
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
malicious cyber actors that are able to

467
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,120
go out and through cyberspace deliver

468
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,679
effects

469
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,720
they know it and they've been planning

470
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,700
for it go back up one

471
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,140
and

472
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,600
they're ready for and I will tell you

473
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,960
that win or lose the next large-scale

474
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,760
contingency operation

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,559
it's going to be determined by who

476
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,799
fights and wins in cyberspace in the

477
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
electromagnetic spectrum

478
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,679
who can fight and win in those domains

479
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,960
okay go next slide so I'm going to hit

480
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
polls on the history lesson and then

481
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,780
what we're going to do is we're going to

482
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,520
talk about the role of the Cyber Corps

483
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm going to go into something called

484
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,760
fm3o you all get a little bit of this

485
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,679
and talk a little bit about multi-domain

486
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,000
operations

487
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
so what you see on the slide aligned

488
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,220
across the top is what we call you know

489
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,559
the Continuum of conflict on the far

490
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,020
left of the chart this is peace this is

491
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,460
zolinsky and Putin hugging their

492
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,799
differences out over a cold one you know

493
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,100
we don't need militaries so on the far

494
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,679
right that's thermonuclear conflict you

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,900
know the worst conflict that you could

496
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,179
imagine and then somewhere in the middle

497
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,419
is what we call crisis this is where a

498
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,160
soldier rotates their selector switch

499
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,260
from safe to semi and squeezes the

500
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,840
trigger and now we are in Conflict

501
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,080
flicked now lives are at risk people are

502
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,580
dying whether there are or whether

503
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,380
they're somebody else's

504
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,059
it's a gray area in there when that

505
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,400
begins when that ends

506
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,380
but competition is where we spend most

507
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,059
of our time in the whole goal of

508
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,740
competition is to avoid going into

509
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,059
conflict

510
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,039
now off on the left for those that know

511
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,080
the Snowman model strategic operational

512
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
tactical the new doctrine it actually

513
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,179
has strategic National level which is

514
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,400
POTUS and then it has strategic theater

515
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,620
level which are your Geographic combat

516
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,580
commands southcom northcom ucom

517
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,080
Indo Paycom

518
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
and so this is really the chart that FM

519
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,780
30s built so why do I bring this up go

520
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,039
ahead and go first bill

521
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,740
so what does our branch do within this

522
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,880
construct

523
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,660
so our 17 alphas and our 17 Charlies and

524
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,059
our 170 Alphas

525
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,539
they fight to win in cyberspace in

526
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,880
competition to prevent us for ever

527
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
having to go to conflict if you think

528
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,220
about what almost all of your peers are

529
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,460
going to do when they get commissioned

530
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,860
it's fairly useless until we roll into

531
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,120
conflict

532
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,100
what can you do with a tank to deter the

533
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,440
Russians you can do live fire exercises

534
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,760
with the poles on the border we've

535
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
called it saber rattling is it a fix is

536
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,620
it effective

537
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,600
that's Up For Debate

538
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,720
but what we do is we are able to go and

539
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,280
reach out through cyberspace and deliver

540
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,960
effects against our adversaries in order

541
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,900
to keep us in competition

542
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,720
so our offensive forces at the Strategic

543
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,660
National level are fighting every day

544
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,179
everywhere and always in the fight

545
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,160
to fight and win

546
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,100
are dco forces are defensive cyberspace

547
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,740
Operation Forces are protecting our

548
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,980
cyberspace capabilities making sure that

549
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,780
the adversary doesn't think he can gain

550
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,460
the upper hand by bringing down our

551
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,380
computers by bringing down our networks

552
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,840
by bringing down our weapon systems

553
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,140
this is the fight that's going on today

554
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,640
this is the fight that many of you will

555
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,400
be given the opportunity to join

556
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,820
now the reality is can cyber keep us in

557
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,520
competition the answer is no Putin was

558
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
going to role in the Ukraine regardless

559
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,580
of what had happened and sometimes

560
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,440
conflict isn't inevitable

561
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,600
and when they bring it to us the reality

562
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,539
is you'll see dco and Oco Peak right

563
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,580
around that crisis line and then it's

564
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,200
going to taper off most of the easy

565
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
targets will be taken down most of the

566
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,520
accesses will be burned most of the

567
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,740
effects will be delivered

568
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,200
and then we roll into conflict

569
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,440
so what does our branch do for conflict

570
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,140
so with the operational and the Tactical

571
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,659
levels what we do is three different

572
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,940
things this is all generally the three

573
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,880
divisions of electromagnetic Warfare

574
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,240
first early on in competition

575
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,280
what are cyber branches doing through

576
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,159
our 17 Bravos or 170 Bravos and our 17

577
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,100
Echoes is they are ensuring that the

578
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,679
commander knows what his signature is in

579
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,900
the electromagnetic spectrum

580
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,940
for those of us that fault well deployed

581
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,039
I will tell you I never saw a radio on

582
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,380
anything other than high power

583
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,539
I can also tell you that in some

584
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,580
theaters of conflict that cueing the mic

585
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,400
on a military handset will get you to

586
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,260
receive artillery within five to eight

587
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,880
minutes

588
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,799
so telling commanders what their

589
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,140
signature is making sure they know how

590
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,700
they stick out

591
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
in the electromagnetic spectrum make

592
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,539
sure they train that way is a huge part

593
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,880
of what our Branch does

594
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,400
now as we inch closer the conflict we'll

595
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,679
start doing electromagnetic support

596
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,500
simply put this is targeting this isn't

597
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,720
intelligence work this is targeting what

598
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,000
we do is we get a couple of lobs lines

599
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,980
of bearings and once you have three of

600
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,020
them you have what's called a fix and so

601
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,659
that is a target that you can shoot and

602
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,840
the really cool thing about modern

603
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
electromagnetic support is that based on

604
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,860
the signals you are seeing you can

605
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,380
identify what system it is

606
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,480
so you can make sure that when you fire

607
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,580
your high dollar high cost weapons or

608
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,580
you commit U.S lives to the battlefield

609
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,140
that they're going after something

610
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,059
that's worth it

611
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,000
and then as we roll into conflict

612
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,940
what our 17 Bravos and our 17 Echoes do

613
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,880
is we do electromagnetic attack

614
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,100
this can be Brute Force jamming just

615
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,700
crank it up to 11 tape down the mic or

616
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,880
it can be a delivery of special purpose

617
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,900
electromagnetic attacks special purpose

618
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,340
EA we call it

619
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,799
this is finally crafted signals that's

620
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,780
grew with the threat systems at the

621
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,100
protocol level

622
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,380
these are the capabilities that are 17

623
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,799
DS our capability developers build

624
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,740
and they are delivered by our soldiers

625
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,260
so to wrap this all together you know

626
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,880
and to give you guys the elevator speech

627
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
regardless of where you end up with or

628
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,780
where you end up at in the cyber force

629
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,880
you need to know what the branch does so

630
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,220
my ask is when somebody asks you what

631
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,480
cyber does

632
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,820
answer for the branch first and then

633
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,679
tell them what you do

634
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,840
and what does the branch do

635
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,960
in competition we fight and win in

636
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
cyberspace to prevent us from having to

637
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,980
go to conflict

638
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,240
failing that when we roll in to conflict

639
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,240
we force the adversary to fight

640
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,419
like it's World War one we push them

641
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,820
back to carrier pigeons runner on foot

642
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,940
and dogs we shut down all their modern

643
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,039
Communications we shut down their

644
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,039
equipment this is what our Branch does

645
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
this is what you all are tasked to do

646
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
and if you think about it we are what is

647
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,919
different from combat a hundred years

648
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,659
ago to combat today

649
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,480
it's the EMS and cyberspace that knitted

650
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,760
all together that give the commander the

651
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,059
information to make smart decisions

652
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,700
at every Echelon and it's our job to

653
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,100
protect that capability and to deny our

654
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,559
adversaries from ever being able to use

655
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,000
it against U.S citizens

656
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,159
so what does this mean for you this is

657
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,740
the third question and the last question

658
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,900
so who are we

659
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,640
who's in this room

660
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,600
and I think it's better to talk from who

661
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,720
are our soldiers go go the next slide

662
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,360
so this is relatively new data six

663
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,740
months ago the numbers were actually

664
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,880
different

665
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,980
these are the soldiers you're going to

666
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,159
be tasked to lead

667
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,159
your average soldier in AIT

668
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,740
is 25 years old

669
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,559
one out of four already has a bachelor's

670
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,679
degree not some college not an associate

671
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,380
history one out of four enlisted cyber

672
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,200
soldiers newly enlisted already has a

673
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,220
bachelor's degree average GT score 119.

674
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,980
and anecdotally I will tell you that we

675
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,279
have the feedback we get from cctc it's

676
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,380
our common cyber core you all get to go

677
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,419
through it

678
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,640
the enlisted consistently complain that

679
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
it's too easy

680
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,299
the officers I am standing up a tutoring

681
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,140
session

682
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,299
because many of them are challenged and

683
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,640
they say it's too hard

684
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,679
these are the soldiers you're being

685
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,980
given the opportunity to lead

686
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,799
this is I I cannot State I cannot

687
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,220
emphasize enough how jealous I am of you

688
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,440
all in this room I'm closer to the end

689
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,299
of my career than the beginning you guys

690
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:19,919
are just getting started and I will tell

691
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,380
you that the Cyber soldiers of today

692
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,720
are a far cry from the Cyber soldiers

693
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,279
that I was given the opportunity to lead

694
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,100

695

00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,919
lead these soldiers and it's going to

698
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,440
require you for you to have the same

699
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,480
technical understanding that they have

700
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,279
in order to give them appropriate

701
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,080
guidance and direction
