1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,259
we're going to change the schedule just

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,940
a little bit slide a few things maybe a

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,520
few minutes so some of the questions on

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,560
Personnel since we have General vial

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,520
here we're going to have him bring up uh

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,779
some a slide that's going to kind of

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,640
explain a little bit overall where we're

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
at with the Army I you just got the

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
Viewpoint of where major wit I'm at is

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,980
at 10th Mountain I remember when I was

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,980
that third ID as a lieutenant we were we

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,480
called ourselves a red-headed stepchild

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
of the 18th Airborne Corps if you're

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,200
there you kind of understand that

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
um so uh with that I'm going to pass it

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
over to General violin he's going to

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,140
give us a quick overview of the

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,640
Personnel status

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,300
yeah Hey so uh Brian vile again so again

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
I have three different hats my second

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,199
hat is office chief of cyber so I'm the

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,719
chief of cyber uh so

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,760
yeah what they're going to push up so we

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,620
this is actually in your deck so if you

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,879
guys go into the digits you were

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,119
provided the last slide of my deck which

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,119
is hidden uh is the slide that hole up

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,939
here there we go uh so and I'll let him

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,380
screw with it but this really talks

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,060
about the branch the demographics what

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,340
we are whatever all the MOs does what

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,860
the core missions are at but really what

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,380
I want to talk to is where the branch is

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,939
at in its growth

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,340
so what you can see really what that

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,979
chart shows is way back when when the

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,259
first 100 of us got an email and it said

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,900
welcome the Cyber branch that was the

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,180
purple mission that was the 17 Alphas

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,360
that was the where we were doing Oco in

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,560
dco

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
a few years back we pulled in what were

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,540
called the functional area 29s the

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,000
electromagnetic Warfare guys the ew guys

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,740
and we took it from a functional area

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,079
and we made it part of the branch

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,140
and since then almost all the growth in

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,360
the branch has been on that 17b the the

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,579
ew side the electromagnetic Warfare side

50
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,340
of the coin and what I'd offer is what

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,899
you don't see there

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,080
is the increasing demands that I have I

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,239
have an additional growth and I think is

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,860
going to get approved for yet another

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,340
400 soldiers for the ew Mission and

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,080
that's just for the counter small uas

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,840
fight the Army is still building this

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,599
part of what my challenge is is trying

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,480
to slow that growth so that it's

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,640
sustainable the branch does not have a

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,500
retention problem every bit of data that

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
we have shows we do not have a retention

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,640
problem we actually retain soldiers in

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,920
accordance with the same Pro or uh the

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,660
same rate the Army has

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,200
where my problem is is trying to grow

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
the Army at the rate they want us to

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,099
grow that is actually the bigger

69
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,620
challenge so when you hear about the

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,940
challenges when you hear about the

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,580
problems within the branch I'd offer

72
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,860
it's a good problem to have because what

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,379
it is is the Army's recognition that

74
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,900
what we do is the most important thing

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,360
in Modern Warfare and it simply is a

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,580
question for me for how fast can I build

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,940
it how fast can I grow it how fast can

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,700
we acquire that equipment my third job

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,440
is Deputy commander of the Cyber Center

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
of Excellence for ew and cyber long

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,659
story short what that involves is

82
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,420
integrating the material capabilities

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,940
along with the doctrine along with the

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,620
personnel and trying to synchronize the

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,319
delivery all in space and time you have

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
to remember we're at the beginning of

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,099
this growth so the equipment the

88
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,260
Fielding the soldiers you guys are going

89
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,000
to see brand new equipment that's being

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,099
fielded there's hot equipment stuff left

91
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,840
over from our 20 years fighting the war

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,180
on terror but what we're bringing to the

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,840
field is flat out incredible and this is

94
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,879
part of where I put a lot of my time all

95
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,680
day every day in order to make sure the

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,420
soldiers the equipment the doctrine the

97
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,659
training all come together at the right

98
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,000
place at the right time so I'll pause

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
there let you take in the slide like I

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,720
said it's in the deck and I'll stand by

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,500
for any questions

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,319
tennis Sikorsky or Cadet Sikorsky my

103
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,959
apologies promoted you before the fact

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,379
uh so what is the reqts acronym there

105
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,900
under the aim section for officers so

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
requirements

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,060
so trying to neck myself in

108
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,720
yeah so what that means so 17 now for

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
requirements

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,639
there are 261 if we're taking a look on

111
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,580
the bottom right for 17A there were open

112
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,540
requirements for 261

113
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,979
17A officers

114
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,580
I only had 77 movers which means today

115
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,320
because you got to remember that's not

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,880
the number of officers available that's

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,979
number of open billets you know so

118
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,840
simple math in public you know there's

119
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,680
around 190 short for 17 Alpha across all

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,340
groups so that second Lieutenant all the

121
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,639
way up to 06. what we're doing you have

122
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,560
to remember where do I get a lieutenant

123
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,820
colonel

124
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,100
he comes from a major where do I get a

125
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,680
major he comes from a captain so part of

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
what we've been able to do is you guys

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
are right size in fact you guys are

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
actually a little bit plus size to try

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,720
to anticipate Army of requirements

130
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,060
really where my shortage is is being

131
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,979
able to reach out across the entire

132
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,800
United States Army and find people that

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,539
have the knowledge skills and ability to

134
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,720
pull them in and make them a cyber

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,780
lieutenant colonel that's a challenge we

136
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,600
do take v-tips but we're very selective

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
I can recruit I can assess piles of

138
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,740
lieutenants

139
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,979
I can't assess or create piles of Majors

140
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,080
Lieutenant Colonels and kernels and

141
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,699
maintain the quality that the force

142
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,039
requires so you just have to appreciate

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,300
when you're looking at those

144
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,199
requirements that's across 01-06

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,160
lieutenants were actually healthy

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
lieutenants actually I think we were at

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
a hundred and 70 percent in anticipation

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,060
of some of the growth about a year ago

149
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,560
I'd have to go back and double check the

150
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,199
numbers but we are leading the target

151
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,600
because of those lines keep going up and

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,180
again I project there's additional line

153
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,940
going uppage coming in the future

154
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,120
the technical term

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
other questions

156
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,720
okay easiest brief of the day no

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
question

158
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,120
no question all right Todd I think I'm

159
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,919
handing it off to you

160
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,640
thank you

161
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,250
[Applause]
