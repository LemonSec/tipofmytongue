46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,640
anyway

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,459
at first choosing a gift to donate to

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,860
West Point and of course we have over

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,180
600 of our classmates still alive was a

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,819
little bit of a chore

51
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,020
you know when we came out on our 50th

52
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Anniversary we set up a little committee

53
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,599
they kind of surveyed the class

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,500
but it became clear to us that once we

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,120
understood just how critical cyber

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,640
operations have become that this was the

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
right thing to endow and and our goal

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
was really to enhance the cadet

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,420
educational experience that would make

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,599
Cadets and our army better and we

61
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,120
figured cyber was an area that needed

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,580
emphasis in the future so we endowed the

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,680
Cyber leaders conference and we're

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,780
enormously proud of each of every each

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,099
and every one of you cyber Warriors

66
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,160
Cadets and officers alike

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
okay

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
back when we were Cadets

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,800
our education revolved around this a

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,200
slide rule you didn't leave home without

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,500
it and you brought it to every class

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,379
and my classmate Frank Monaco reminds me

73
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,640
that

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
computer Punch Cards that's how you

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,680
programmed a computer back then and

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
there weren't many of us that did that

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,360
Frank did I didn't

78
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,580
but we wouldn't intend class without our

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,980
Slide Rule and this is the original one

80
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,959
that I had as a Cadet so if you want to

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,060
take and look at it I can't read it

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,739
anymore my eyesight's not good enough

83
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
but we've come a long way for sure since

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,019
the days of slide rules and I can't tell

85
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,180
you how impressed we are with how you're

86
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,060
adopting to the warp speed of technology

87
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,299
today and keeping this nation in front

88
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,360
and safe from all who would do us harm

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,120
sooner than you can imagine you'll be

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,099
out front and you know this better than

91
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,080
we ever did our nation's military

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,260
leaders cannot fight future conflicts

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,120
with technology

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,519
with the technology weapons and tactics

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,159
of the last war so it's incumbent upon

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,060
us to really learn and develop the Cyber

97
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,239
Concepts that will keep us out in front

98
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,440
and that

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,040
you know gives us the the fitting title

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,580
for this uh conference company grade

101
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,699
leadership in cyber because it's really

102
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,460
at your level company grade level that

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,520
this is going to snowball and grow and

104
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
develop within the army

105
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,620
and the conference is privileged to have

106
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,120
company grade officers who've already

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,740
been in the trenchers

108
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,380
they and you are the future of the army

109
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,300
cyber branch

110
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,220
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,139
broader theme of the conference and

112
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,060
that's being the importance of cyber

113
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,340
operations to the nation's overall

114
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,820
security it's not just military it

115
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,060
impacts our preparedness in physical

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,580
economic and intellectual infrastructure

117
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,620
and coming from the financial services

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,979
industry as I've been in my career I can

119
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,259
tell you that there's a lot of attention

120
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,740
that goes into cyber security in that

121
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,060
business and I'm sure many other

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,560
businesses

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,020
again I'm honored that aci's leadership

124
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,639

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
cyber conference and I look forward to

132
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,240
speaking is going to be the ACI director

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,560
uh Colonel Stephen Hamilton

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,699
[Applause]

135
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,220
all right good morning everyone

136
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,699
all right motivated okay so

137
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,639
um I'm the ACI director as of December

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
14th last year so only about a month or

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,860
so but I've been in ACI for a while when

140
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,979
I got to ACI within about a year or so

141
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,560
General Hernandez came and said we want

142
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,120
to do the Cyber leader conference and we

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
all scratched our head and said what

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,820
does that mean what does this look like

145
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,460
how is this going to work

146
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,160
we started the planning for it and then

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,020
I think we got our best guy if some of

148
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,580
you may know major susowitz he was the

149
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,080
first planner for this conference and

150
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
then this thing called covet happened so

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,319
we didn't have the conference in the

152
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,720
epcs and then we tried to figure out how

153
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
to restart it and uh so this is the

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,340
second one uh and this is really I'm

155
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,900
just excited because this is what we

156
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,699
envisioned so I if you would have asked

157
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,080
me five years ago if this is where it

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
was going to be I wouldn't have known I

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,259
wouldn't have been comfortable saying it

160
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,479
we would make it there but we've got

161
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,699
everybody here I think from what I

162
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,160
understand this is the first time that

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,220
this cohort of class of 23 cyber

164
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,259
officers will all be together in the

165
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,660
same room so this is um this is just an

166
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,539
awesome awesome thing as I thought about

167
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,699
this there's no other branch that does

168
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,500
something like this but we're also the

169
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,060
newest branch and we're still trying to

170
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,120
build it and and figure it out so

171
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,860
um I I'm just super excited we got

172
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,319
everybody here today what I would like

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,840
to do is just kind of leave you with two

174
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,860
thoughts as you go through this

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,099
conference the first one is actually for

176
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,300
our active duty here who are in the

177
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,099
cyber force we use a lot of acronyms

178
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,160
please like say what those are

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,319
and I'll tell all the cadets if they say

180
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,120
the acronym ask them what it means don't

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
don't be afraid to ask this is the

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,139
perfect time for you to try to figure

183
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,300
out what the cyber force is like so

184
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,880
there there may be some rabbit holes of

185
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
things and all of a sudden you're kind

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,340
of lost in the conversation just stop

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,139
and say hey what what does that actually

188
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,580
mean what are you talking about like

189
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,800
this is the this is the forum for you to

190
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,139
try to figure out how the Cyber Branch

191
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,900
works so I'm I'm real excited that we're

192
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,819
able to make this work and again I I

193
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,240
can't thank the class of 70 enough

194
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,720
for this endowment to make this happen

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,599
hopefully indefinitely so I give a quick

196
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,890
Round of Applause for the class of 70.

197
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,599
[Applause]
