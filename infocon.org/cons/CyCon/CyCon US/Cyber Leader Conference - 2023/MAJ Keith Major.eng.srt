conference we've brought in some

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,840
additional guest speakers uh and these

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,220
these folks the first one we're going to

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,439

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
going to give you a perspective on as a

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,579
team lead as kind of the first uh field

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,960
grade officer in your chain of command

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
what is expected of you what they're

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,719
anticipating and what they think you

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,660
should understand to be ready for on

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,879
those uh at that Team level from from

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,100
the field grades so the first one that

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,840
we have here as a guest speaker is Major

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Keith major he's a 2008 graduate from a

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,219
West Point majored in Information

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,440
Technology while he was here and he has

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,000
a master's degree in computer science

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,739
from Stanford University

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,199
uh he completed a company command in

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,760
2015 and transferred over to the Cyber

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,379
Branch he then taught in the East

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,040
department and then he is held a number

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,860
of cyber jobs he is currently the 91 CPT

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,240
Liam CPT lead uh down at Fort Gordon and

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,158
I will turn it over to you teeth

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,000
well good afternoon cyber leaders

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,119
there we go so I've been given the best

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,240
challenge opportunity to speak just

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,799
after you had a good meal and during

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,560
your normally scheduled Dean's hour nap

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
so uh thanks Colonel Arnold for this

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,299
opportunity

39
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,600
so as a former 2008 Cadet as was just

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,460
stated I know that some of you are here

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,860
because you want to get out of law or

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,740
Mill Arts I might just be projecting on

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,560
those two or you're here because you

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,380
want to be as a former instructor I know

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,920
I have your attention for five minutes

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,720
or because you're here to learn you

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,939
might listen to me a little longer my

48
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,818
talk is focused on that second group

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,860
both cases

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,420
um so I'll say it's a little weird to

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,180
give a speech about my expectations of

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,400
company grades because I normally do

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,860
this in initial counseling and that is

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,480
more of a conversation

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,340
so I'll give you a little bit of my

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,440
background in dco or defensive cyber

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,900
operations so you have a background of

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,780
why I expect what I do I'll talk about

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,120
my leadership philosophy as well as my

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,700
leadership values and then I'll open the

61
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,319
door for questions so we can have that

62
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,060
conversation

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,739
so I've had the privilege of being a

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,800
team lead on two cyber protection teams

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,200
503 CPT and currently 91 cyber

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,080
Protection Team I've been in support of

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,140
Joint Force Headquarters cyber Navy as

68
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,980
well as Joint Force Headquarters doden

69
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,680
so I guess I don't work for the Army on

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,260
both of those so I've traveled a little

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,940
bit with the Cyber protection Brigade

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,340
I've gone to Korea I've gone to Hawaii

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,160
I've gone to the Pentagon and we've done

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,239
missions as well on the Defense Finance

75
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,879
terrain as well as transcom so really

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,220
good experiences on both of my cyber

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,900
protection teams

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
so

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,700
cyber protection teams your job

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,360
is in the dodin to discover the

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,940
adversary and to protect the doad in

82
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,980
from the adversary's attacks

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,019
General vile told you about why that's

84
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,060
important is to ensure that our

85
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,239
commanders continue to make decisions at

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,400
the opportune time

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,860
you're you will be in a constant

88
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,099
operational and training cycle

89
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,280
preparing for Mission and executing them

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,220
you could work with brief and report to

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,799
General officers senior executive

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,739
service civilians joints staff officers

93
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,920
and numerous Colonels in the Army Air

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,200
Force Marines and

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,500
to our midshipman Navy as well

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,239
for your operation missions to be

97
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,739
successful you will need to integrate

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,019
and get support from cyber security

99
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,060
service providers those Network local

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,478
Defenders and network technicians not

101
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,940
developing buy-in from each party

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
will impact your analysts ability to do

103
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
their job

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,000
you will take operations orders from

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,759
myself and people like me and develop

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,380
clear tasks and purpose for your

107
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,440
subordinates and Report daily to a joint

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
staff potentially while on Mission

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,759
and when your mission is over you will

110
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,400
write an operational report for what you

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,680
discovered that can be consumed and read

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,100
at the Joint Force Headquarters level as

113
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,180
well as the combat and command level

114
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,960
now these are large tasks to ask any new

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,180
company grade officer

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,580
but cyber is a team sport

117
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,500
and you will not be alone and I will

118
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,139
prepare you to execute your assigned

119
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,759
duties

120
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,380
so let me give you my definition of

121
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,300
leadership as part of our initial

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,259
counseling

123
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,919
enable the success of others

124
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,340
enable the success of others

125
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,740
my job is to enable your success by

126
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,199
giving you feedback opportunities to

127
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,080
learn to challenge you and to coach you

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,259
Your Role is to be coachable

129
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,120
I don't prefer Hot Heads on my team

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,340
they're usually out for themselves and

131
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,320
don't care about enabling the success of

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
their subordinates

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,479
I expect you as Leaders to enable the

134
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,840
success of your ncos your warrants your

135
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
department of army civilians and your

136
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,340
soldiers under your care

137
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,259
I expect my leaders to give me input

138
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,020
into my operational plans to ask for

139
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,539
clarity and to be honest in after Action

140
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,300
reviews so we can all improve together

141
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,639
as I said cyber is a team sport we need

142
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,560
to ensure everyone feels part of our

143
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,340
team

144
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,160
and then can positively contribute to

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,320
our mission

146
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,139
I'm going to challenge you to lead with

147
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,080
focus on four leadership values that I

148
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
personally believe are great or critical

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
in creating great teams those leadership

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,900
values are a character care competence

151
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,479
and team learning

152
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,060
now let me talk about each in detail for

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,080
a moment

154
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,639
your character

155
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,039
is foundational for your arming career

156
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,660
as an officer

157
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,100
now there are different definitions of

158
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
that out there and I utilize the Army

159
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,919
values

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,539
because it's common

161
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,940
Foundation to everyone in the army

162
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,100
so let me discuss two of those

163
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,919
integrity and personal courage

164
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,240
integrity

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,759
I trust everyone when I start a new

166
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,100
assignment and I encourage you to do the

167
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,000
same

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,340
that trust is only broken based off of

169
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,139
issues with integrity

170
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,240
this trust is not broken when we plan on

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,340
getting something done and don't plans

172
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,360
change

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,120
it's when we report on something and

174
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,639
will willingly deceive

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
do not give away your integrity

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
this branch is small your reputation

177
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,160
will go a long way and will precede you

178
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,220
in your future jobs

179
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,560
the second character trait is personal

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,639
courage

181
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,860
now is the 17 Alpha

182
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,780
it is very rarely are you going to be

183
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,180
putting your life in danger you're more

184
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,360
likely to see as we do in every branch

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,940
in this service times when someone is

186
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,979
not doing the right thing

187
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,680
and people ignore it and thus encourage

188
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,660
it by not saying something

189
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,699
well you do if you hear a joke about

190
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,599
someone's sex culture race or religion

191
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,400
will you approach them and say hey we

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,740
don't do that here or where you ignore

193
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,599
it and allow members of your team to

194
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,419
feel less than and ostracized

195
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,340
I expect my leaders to have the personal

196
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,220
courage to not walk past an infraction

197
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,039
as silly as laces sticking out of

198
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,419
someone's boots

199
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,819
to a security infraction

200
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,460
not every report you give will be

201
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,039
positive and reflect positively on you

202
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,900
but you need the personal courage to

203
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,479
still do the right thing

204
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,759
as I've said multiple times and I will

205
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,580
continue to say cyber is a team sport it

206
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,259
requires cohesive teams where everyone

207
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,139
feels valued and everyone is accountable

208
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,080
ensure your people feel valued

209
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,940
and that brings me to the second

210
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,760
leadership value that I expect you to

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,500
have and that's care

212
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,539
you need to treat everyone with dignity

213
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,799
and respect

214
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,539
period

215
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,399
people will not be successful if they

216
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,839
don't feel like they are part of our

217
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,800
team

218
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,620
everyone brings value to our team

219
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,720
you must learn your people as

220
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
individuals what's their goals

221
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,180
their weaknesses what's important to

222
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,899
them

223
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,720
get to know them help them Reach their

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,200
goals and be their best advocate

225
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,820
to demonstrate care for your people

226
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,740
you'll need to train them

227
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,980
to do anything you ask of them

228
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,720
a briefing

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
an acft and yes we still do that

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,019
a mission on a new type of terrain that

231
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,000
you've never been on before a promotion

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,380
board

233
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,300
you need to spend the time to care for

234
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,519
your people by preparing them to do the

235
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,380
missions you ask of them

236
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,000
and then you need to ensure you give

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
them feedback on their performance so

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,100
they have every opportunity to improve

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,800
and to grow

240
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,540
and then you unsure a timely and

241
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,060
accurate evaluations and awards to care

242
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,339
for their careers

243
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,880
the final part of care is care for self

244
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,860
you need to find ways to balance your

245
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,800
life and your work to relax and do what

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,540
is important to you

247
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,899
just like you should care about your

248
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,940
soldiers and civilians taking care of

249
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,459
themselves you need to be deliberate in

250
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,560
how you do this for you

251
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,140
you cannot care for others if you don't

252
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,980
care for yourself

253
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,560
so I've talked about leadership it's

254
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,959
about enabling the success of others and

255
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,000
we talk through two of my four

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
leadership values which is character and

257
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,300
care

258
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,860
so at this halfway point I know what

259
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,240
you're all thinking

260
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
I wonder if major major is right in

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,959
catch-22

262
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,640
do you think he'll change his name if he

263
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
gets promoted

264
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,959
well to alleviate all of your bargaining

265
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,480
concerns you may have about me the

266
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,940
answer to both is no

267
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,620
well I guess I'll keep my day job

268
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,959
all right let's talk about competence

269
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,940
what I mean by competence is you should

270
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,399
strive for excellence

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,680
in being an army leader

272
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,360
some of that

273
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,519
some of you may think that is just being

274
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,680
technically competent and being

275
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,839
technically competent is part of being a

276
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,980
cyber leader

277
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,600
but it's more than that

278
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,940
you should strive to be competent in

279
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,019
your planning

280
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,660
your interpersonal skills your briefing

281
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,680
skills

282
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
and dare I say you're writing

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,540
and I know the English Department could

284
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,760
talk about my writing

285
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
you should know your cyber warfare

286
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,680
Publications and your army regulations

287
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,140
now this competency is built over time

288
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,019
you will not get it when you first show

289
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,060
up to my team

290
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,560
but you will continue learning

291
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,600
throughout your time in Bullock and

292
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,899
whenever you show up to your next job

293
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,800
do not pass up on opportunities to learn

294
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,740
you should always be learning

295
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,420
so why should you strive for some

296
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,100
technical understanding

297
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,980
you'll be translators between the

298
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,260
technical and the less technical

299
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,839
when translating up you are expected to

300
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,820
translate our technical cyber language

301
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,339
to language your mission partner

302
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,899
understands

303
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,700
joint terms operational terms army terms

304
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
when translating down to your analysts

305
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,240
you will need to translate those

306
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,060
operational terms in a technical way for

307
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,399
your analysts to execute

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,680
now you will not be perfect and you are

309
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,240
not expected to be

310
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
you have your weaknesses and because my

311
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,579
job is to enable your success I will

312
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,440
help you with opportunities to overcome

313
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
them

314
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
as I said before you need to be willing

315
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,740
to be coached to be successful learn and

316
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,560
continue learning read and ask questions

317
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,540
then take what you have learned and

318
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,579
ensure those in your severe of influence

319
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,279
know them too

320
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,380
cyber is a team sport we need everyone

321
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,660
to be

322
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,480
doing the mission to be sick for us to

323
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,980
be successful

324
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,200
and they need their opportunity to learn

325
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,760
to grow

326
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,760
for us all to be successful

327
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
so that brings me to my last leadership

328
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,360
value of Team learning

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
I know it doesn't start with a c and

330
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,600
I've already talked about my English

331
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,899
skills so I hope you understand

332
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,959
so team learning is important because we

333
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,180
all need to grow and improve together

334
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,160
everyone should be given an opportunity

335
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,959
to learn and grow

336
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,540
not all will seize the opportunities you

337
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,880
provide them but it's your part to

338
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,160
provide each one under your care that

339
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
opportunity for growth

340
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,700
you should strive for shared

341
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
understanding with everyone around you

342
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,660
be comfortable with learning from

343
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,920
mistakes

344
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,639
your successes and mere accidents none

345
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,320
of us including me

346
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,779
are immune to mistakes successes and

347
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,160
accidents

348
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
you should be deliberate and learning

349
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,700
from them and have the humility to

350
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,920
ensure everyone else has the opportunity

351
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,320
to learn from them as well

352
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,779
now on my team we conduct aars we

353
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,000
capture Lessons Learned and these

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
lessons are lost if they're not

355
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,899
Revisited or incorporated into our daily

356
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,279
work

357
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,339
we may find ourselves as we often do in

358
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,279
91 cyber Protection Team doing something

359
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,139
new for the first time

360
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,180
regardless of the outcome it is an

361
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,639
opportunity to learn from it and ensure

362
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,079
we do it better

363
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,859
the next time

364
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,480
we are doing team learning correctly on

365
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,279
91 CPT

366
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,260
if we execute the routine things

367
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,639
routinely

368
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,579
and by making success repeatable

369
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,860
let me repeat that

370
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,800
for you as Mission element leads on 91

371
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
CPT

372
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,579
we need to execute the routine things

373
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,060
routinely and make success repeatable

374
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,399
one person's success can translate into

375
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,639
team success if everyone learns from it

376
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
and improves too

377
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,339
cyber is a team sport

378
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,980
maybe even by the fourth time I say it

379
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,959
maybe you'll believe me

380
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,300
we need everyone to be part of the

381
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,339
solution so we can grow and learn

382
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,079
together

383
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,440
so that brings me to the end

384
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,839
of our initial counseling before we

385
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,480
start our conversation I've given you my

386
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
definition of leadership that I expect

387
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
you all to lead with enable the success

388
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,940
of others

389
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,459
I ask you to lean with the fourth

390
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,199
leadership values

391
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,720
of your character you care for the

392
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,040
people under you

393
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,800
to strive for competence and to ensure

394
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,019
we have Team learning

395
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,060
doing this well will enable the success

396
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,199
of others

397
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,440
and they not you they will make you

398
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,060
successful

399
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,100
now to prepare yourself for the next

400
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,480
steps of your career

401
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,880
take every opportunity to learn

402
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,440
be coachable

403
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,760
be humble

404
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,440
and ensure those in your sphere of

405
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,680
influence are all learning together

406
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
I encourage you whoever the army takes

407
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,760
you enable the success of others by

408
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,399
demonstrating care character competence

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,920
and a focus on team learning

410
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,740
now for the second half of our initial

411
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,199
counseling open the floor and I welcome

412
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,800
any questions

413
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,069
[Applause]

414
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,220
in the back

415
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,079
hold on a second we'll grab a microphone

416
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,500
for you

417
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
good afternoon sir good my favorite

418
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,959
question is

419
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,660
how do you best make use of the many

420
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,560
backgrounds and educational and cultural

421
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,320
and other types that you find from

422
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,800
working with both officers ncos and also

423
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,660
Department of the army civilians how are

424
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,540
you best making use of that yeah great

425
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,280
question

426
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,099
so whenever we get our orders and go

427
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,619
into the operational process

428
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,099
that invitation to develop our plan for

429
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,419
the team

430
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,640
is

431
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,199
everyone on the team is given

432
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,380
opportunity to give input and

433
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,619
we may find people with expertise on a

434
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,359
specific type of terrain

435
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,100
that's an E4

436
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,919
and I sure want them in planning for a

437
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,220
mission because our success could be

438
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
dependent

439
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,780
on the input that they provide

440
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,299
so the first step is getting to know

441
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,440
your people

442
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,240
right you need to know what their

443
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,460
strengths what their weaknesses are and

444
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,320
as a mission element lean on a cyber

445
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
Protection Team you will be that

446
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,160
Advocate on behalf of all of your

447
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,679
soldiers and civilians to the

448
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,960
operational process and then bringing

449
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,900
them with you when we do planning

450
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,179
so how do you leverage it

451
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,860
when you do a service time training or

452
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,720
Hip Pocket training it doesn't matter

453
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,340
who's giving it doesn't have to be a

454
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,720
sergeant doesn't have to be a warrant

455
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
officer it could be a civilian

456
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,980
it could be like I said a PFC

457
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,740
you will be shocked by the expertise

458
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,980
within your formation and the drive that

459
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,860
they have to succeed and so what I

460
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,240
challenge you to do is just to harness

461
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
it and to include them into the the

462
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,880
planning process

463
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,740
and then ensure you get feedback from

464
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,419
them too because their voice matters

465
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,620
other questions

466
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,880
it's a great question

467
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
um and it probably has to do what I feel

468
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,500
is a place that I did not succeed as

469
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,140
well and I was in company command I

470
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,059
wasn't a good coach

471
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,120
and so coming here to teach in the eats

472
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,340
Department

473
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,200
seeing two of my students In This Crowd

474
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,480
hi Skye hi Brian

475
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,260
um

476
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,919
that I think has changed my leadership

477
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,860
philosophy the most in that when we

478
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,919
coach each other when I coach when you

479
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,280
coach down that everyone grows at the

480
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,140
same time and then we can do a whole lot

481
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,059
more than what we could have done

482
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,000
previously so

483
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,580
these probably most of these leadership

484
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,980
values were kind of part of my personal

485
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,799
belief probably after company command in

486
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,120
a whole lot of reflection and then

487
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,940
opportunities for growth

488
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,220
our previous Brigade Commander from the

489
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,100
Cyber protection Brigade and Anna

490
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,720
current Brigade Commander they focus a

491
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,260
lot on care and care for people General

492
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,179
I think it was General McConnell said

493
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,600
that the Army is in a business of people

494
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,980
and that

495
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,080
if we're not leading well people are

496
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,360
getting out for leading well and they're

497
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,740
brought into the mission they're going

498
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,400
to stay in and we need them to do that

499
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,059
it's a good question

500
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:46,159
[Applause]
