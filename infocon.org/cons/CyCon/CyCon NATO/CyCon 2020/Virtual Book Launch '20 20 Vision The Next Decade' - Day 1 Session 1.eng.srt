dear faithful cyclone crowd outside it

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,270
is one of those two sunny days we get in

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,729
Estonia every year it's a perfect

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,240
saikhan weather but we're not having a

28
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,179
psyche on we really wanted to have the

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,579
conference we really were looking

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,970
forward to discussions on a topic 2020

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,570
vision the next decade and kind of a

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,670
it's an irony and illuminating that the

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,579
conference on this topic was taken out

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,280
by an event that no one saw coming that

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,770
coffee 19 pandemic I was a young staff

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,860
officer in 2018 now I command

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,658
transformation when they were presenting

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,969
their multiple futures project I

39
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,030
remember there being valleys and Peaks

40
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,630
and then there were swans and the black

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,310
swans swimming hiding behind mountains

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,360
and valleys they were the events that

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,390
nobody could see coming

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,580
well I'm sure that multiple futures

45
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,920
project didn't see a couple months later

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,620
Russia occupying Georgia in August

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,609
2008 and I'm sure it in Cedar Cove 19

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,680
pandemic it just happens so but we're

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,739
having we're having a virtual book

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:31,290
launch you can see the book revolving

51
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,180
behind Henrik and Lina they're judging

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,660
by the cover it's the greatest saikhan

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,970
book ever now this is the reason we

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,640
can't have a virtual conference because

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,370
when I try to be funny I don't hear you

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,290
boo it's just an uncomfortable silence

57
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:54,180
of an empty studio we have 18 out of 19

58

60
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,690

would like to give the floor to the

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,630
first moderator dr. max meets from the

117

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:06,030
warm welcome Saigon 2020 I'm really

121
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,759
pleased to be moderating this session

122
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,250
not only because we have a star lineup

123
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,289
of speakers but also because these three

124
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,569
papers discuss in this session provide

125
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,628
really interesting insights which is

126
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,669
some ways are overlapping but also

127
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,280
potentially at odds so it promises to be

128
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,068
really interesting before we start let

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,580
me briefly discuss a few online House

130
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,210
Rules

15 minutes you are free to submit

133
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,860
written questions during the talk and we

134
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,409
will collect them and give the speakers

135
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,690
a few minutes after each talk to address

136
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,639
the questions if we have more time at

137
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,680
the very end of the session we work on

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,889
more general questions and potentially

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,680
directed at multiple speakers right

140
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,229
without further ado let me introduce the

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,630
first speaker professor Martin libecki

142

know in fact I didn't do a formal count

151
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,318

152
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,469
published author on cyber strategy and

153
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,400

157
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,120
if I were really there but circumstances

158
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,750
have put me behind a laptop rather than

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,250
in person

160
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:47,449

166
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,460
I put it up there mostly because I want

167
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,560
to discuss the the subtext rather than

168
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,460
the text the text you can read the

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,719
subtext is really the question about

170
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,210
what is escalation

171
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:14,699
how does cyber attack cyber war

172
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,669
cyberspace operations play into the

173
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,379
whole tableau of escalation and the

174
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,539
first question you have to ask when you

175
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,539
put cyber into an escalation matrix is

176
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,719
the first question you have to ask when

177
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,490
you have to when you put cyber into an

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,958
escalation matrix is is the cyber box

179
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,089
some one of those things that's going to

180
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,760
get you into the kinetic box in other

181
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,519
words you have sort of two propositions

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,620
the first proposition is that cyberspace

183
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,570
is its own domain in the sense that

184
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,000
whatever happens in cyberspace stays in

185
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,640
cyberspace the world of kinetic conflict

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,500
is its domain and there's unlikely to be

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,420
crossing from one to the other the

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,769
second proposition the opposite one is

189
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,540
in fact in cyberspace merely occupies a

190
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:07,019
position on the spectrum of conflict

191
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,569
that there is no if so facto reason why

192
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:13,320
events that start in cyberspace cannot

193
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,930
end up in kinetic space and that as some

194
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,290
people have said conflict in cyberspace

195
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:24,630
is particularly escalatory for a large

196
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:26,790
number of reasons so what I wanted to do

197
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,220
with this paper is to try to tease out

198
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,680
some of the paths in which there may be

199
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,350
correlations between events in

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,810
cyberspace and events in the kinetic

201
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:41,790
world okay so the first question let's

202
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,589
go to the next slide is do countries

203
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,160
retaliate in the real world for

204
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,690
operations in cyberspace okay well let's

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,660
start off with the simpler questions in

206
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:54,779
fact is there retaliation in cyberspace

207
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,430
in and of itself well there are certain

208
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,850
things that you see you see tit-for-tat

209
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,209
dyads in cyberspace for instance between

210
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,829
india-pakistan dyad in the one between

211
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:07,410
Israel and the Palestinians or Israel

212
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:11,279
and broader Arab world between Israel

213
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,040
and Iran but generally speaking one

214
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,730
is more struck by the lack retaliation

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,349
in cyberspace then actual retaliation

216
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,670
cyberspace okay now there are a few

217
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,769
instances there is the opinion that the

218
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:29,219
2012 DDoS attacks at Iran pulled on US

219
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:32,370
banks were retaliation for Stuxnet there

220
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,069
is some sort of evidence that the Saudi

221
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,290
Aramco ypur attacks in 2012 were a

222
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:40,139
retaliation for wiper attacks and

223
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,889
Iranian refineries whose attribution

224
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:47,040
still remains murky I believe and to

225
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,920
accommodate my talk of last week or so

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,519
there was a retaliation by Israel

227
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:56,910
presumably Israel against Iranian ports

228
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:59,639
in retaliation for an attack that was

229
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,420
blamed on the Iranians on Israeli

230
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,360
waterworks

231
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:08,998
okay but again those those are really

232
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,860
positive examples now when you go to the

233
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:12,980
question at hand which is physical

234
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,949
retaliation for cyber attacks

235
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,589
there is almost no evidence it's the

236
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,170
only possible piece of evidence and I

237
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,110
want to underline possible and dispute

238
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,430
it is the assassination of Motaba and

239
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,819
I'm not going to get this one pronounced

240
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,479
correctly

241
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:34,050
Madhi for a cyber attack carried out on

242
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,850
the and part of Israel's infrastructure

243
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,529
in the city of Haifa okay

244
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,040
so at this point let's go to the next

245
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,040
slide okay

246
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:48,089
um second question is is there a basis

247
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,709
for retaliation in other words have

248
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:54,360
people made the equivalence between

249
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:55,888
cyber attacks and physical attacks and

250
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,019
one of the one of the characteristics of

251
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,149
a cyber attack is we have yet to after

252
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,579
25 years of staring at this particular

253
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,420
space seeing a cyber attack which has

254
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,128
produced casualties as a direct result

255
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,099
now there are some disputed issues about

256
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,779
casualties as an indirect result of a

257
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,759
cyber attack

258
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:18,899
there's investigations for instance that

259
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,670
the wannabe attacks on at affected some

260
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,529
US hospitals may have led to an

261
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,479
increased mortality rate there's been

262
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,050
investigation Britain which suggested

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,090
that our my

264
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,530
we accept the conclusion was in fact

265
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,560
that they couldn't find any increased

266
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,680
mortality rate but direct casualties we

267
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,930
haven't seen okay so the question is do

268
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,640
you want to go from a realm on which

269
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,130
there are no direct casualties into a

270
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,770
rum in fact where direct casualties are

271
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:47,040
what they what the activity is about and

272
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,050
for this the question becomes are we

273
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,180
starting to see an emerging threshold

274
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:57,479
that separates damaging but non-lethal

275
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:00,569
operations from lethal operations that's

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,010
actually a broader topic here let me

277
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,770
just suggest that we may be seeing the

278
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,750
beginnings of that sort of threshold not

279
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,090
as strong as the threshold between war

280
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,320
and peace or as strong we believe is the

281
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,600
threshold between conventional and

282
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
nuclear war but in an emerging threshold

283
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,500
nonetheless if you switch to academic

284
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,080
research people like Jacqueline

285
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,680
Schneider and others have basically used

286
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,110
polling and test data to indicate a

287
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,800
general reluctance of people in war

288
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,150
games or people who are polled to see

289
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,439
the two as equivalent

290
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,350
okay precisely because in my opinion of

291
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,320
the casualty difference okay other words

292
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,870
by Jensen valeriano suggests looking at

293
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,820
data sets suggested cyber attacks are

294
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,790
more likely to provide not an escalation

295
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,950
but as a means as an off-ramp to a

296
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,810
crisis a way of saying I'm not happy

297
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,580
with what you're doing but I definitely

298
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,699
don't know don't want a war ought to a

299
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:01,440
result for this anyhow okay let's go to

300
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:04,980
the next slide now this is an

301
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,840
interesting question because we end up

302
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,970
having to dispute the premise the

303
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,890
cyberspace escalation leads to kinetic

304
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,690
escalation and that leads to the

305
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,410
question is there such a thing as

306
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,330
cyberspace escalation okay um and the

307
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,890
answer may not necessarily be yes and

308
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,620
the reason the answer may not

309
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,540
necessarily be yes several factors

310
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,180
first of all escalation implies

311
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,459
continuous operations sort of a level of

312
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,829
what you started at level one activity

313
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,200
and you go to a level of a next activity

314
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,670
okay if you actually take a look at

315
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,190
cyberspace operations they tend to be

316
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,170
episodic not continuous and it tends to

317
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,660
very difficult to establish that there

318
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,240
is a specific level of combat going on

319
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,670
in cyberspace now that is true so far

320
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,740
that may not be true in a future

321
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,650
scenario but so far that seems to be the

322
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:57,000
case okay next question changes in

323
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,069
intensity there is a random port put out

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,020
about a dozen years ago which had a nice

325
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,510
definition of escalation and it was two

326
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,910
parts one is the change in intensity the

327
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,740
other is a crossing of thresholds okay

328
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,579
both of them were problematic in

329
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,770
cyberspace

330
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,810
a change in intensity would be the

331
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,970
change in effort for instance it was

332
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,380
widely understood that we were the

333
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,930
United States was escalating the

334
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:23,160
conflict in Vietnam by putting more

335
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,949
forces into the country okay well more

336
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,750
forces doesn't translate into very much

337
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,190
in cyberspace in any way you can't see

338
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,470
more forces being drawn into a conflict

339
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,270
in cyberspace because of the nature of

340
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,860
the beast and the correlation between

341
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,990
the amount of effort you put in

342
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,170
cyberspace and the amount of effects you

343
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,420
get is hardly straightforward there is a

344
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,030
great deal of noise in the equation

345
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,459
between effects on efforts on one end

346
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,380
and effects on the other that leaves us

347
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,960
the third the second criterion which is

348
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,790
a change in thresholds okay for a change

349
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,740
in thresholds you need a consensus that

350
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,569
certain things are below a threshold and

351
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,820
certain things are above a threshold we

352
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,070
are nowhere near that consensus in

353
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,220
cyberspace the closest we have to a

354
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:10,890
threshold is to distinguish attacks and

355
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:14,550
infrastructure from all other cyber

356
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,020
attacks but if you look at it if you

357
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,540
look at that definition closely it's

358
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,370
extremely gauzy so the question remains

359
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,650
hypothetical in other words we don't

360
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,780
have escalation in cyberspace that we

361
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,890
can talk about and therefore asking

362
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,380
whether it's caused Connecticut

363
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,880
escalation is in many ways a question

364
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:34,290
too far ok let's go to the next slide

365
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,630
next slide would cyberspace operations

366
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,900
on sensitive targets put them in play

367
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:42,060
again this is a hypothetical and so I

368
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,250
want to talk basically the paper talked

369
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,780
it through hypothetical in other words

370
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,510
if there are targets where we don't want

371
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,089
them touched for military reasons but if

372
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,730
you carry out

373
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,129
cyberattack on them is it possible that

374
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,430
it will remove the inhibition for a

375
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,249
physical attack on these systems ok the

376
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,168
two systems I have in mind are

377
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:08,650
satellites and nuclear command and

378
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,569
control systems and I'm gonna basically

379
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,409
have to draw a blank on that question

380
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:18,520
because we have seen cyber attacks on

381
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:21,309
satellites we have seen test testing of

382
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,889
anti-satellite weapons the two don't

383
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,959
tend to be correlated yet as far as

384
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,380
nuclear command and control issues there

385
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,470
are known known public cyber attacks on

386
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,029
nuclear command control so we don't

387
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,850
really have all that much to work with

388
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:41,529
ok and let's go to the next question

389
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:44,199
and next slide excuse me and the next

390
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:46,510
slide I'm going to actually ask this in

391
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,990
a very strange question in other words

392
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:54,129
will countries draw inferences from a

393
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,990
cut from one sides failure to respond to

394
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,760
a cyber attack in such a way that

395
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,940
emboldened them to carry out at a

396
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,770
connecticut AK and i have one example in

397
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:08,140
mind and that is the proposition the

398
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:12,899
hypothesis that a failure to react to

399
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:15,520
the Saudi Aramco case in 2012 may have

400
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:17,500
emboldened I don't like the word but I

401
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,440
can't think of a synonym right now may

402
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,640
have emboldened Iran to carry out

403
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:32,169
kinetic attacks on Saudi Aramco physical

404
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:36,159
facilities in 2019 ok but if you're

405
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:38,620
gonna take a look at Iran's attack on

406
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,169
the facilities probably a better case

407
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,789
would be the events that had taken place

408
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:45,159
several months earlier in the Persian

409
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,110
Gulf in which a u.s. Global Hawk was

410
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,510
shot down and there was not a kinetic

411
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,979
response to that perhaps because nobody

412
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,870
was killed in the Global Hawk attack

413
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,149
since it was an unmanned aircraft so I

414
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,129
would have to answer the question that

415
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:01,689
there may be at some future point that

416
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,460
sort of correlation but we haven't seen

417
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,820
it yet ok

418
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,510
let's get to the conclusions and on the

419
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,510
next slide okay

420
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:15,330
conclusions so far the evidence suggests

421
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,120
that what starts in cyberspace stays in

422
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:22,949
cyberspace but I have to offer these

423
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,649
caveats one this is true so far cyber

424
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,750
attacks could get worse and if they get

425
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,430
worse they may approach the point where

426
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,190
some countries cross over from cyber

427
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,710
into kinetic space number two this is

428
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,770
based on public reports okay if things

429
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,720
have happened in the classified world I

430
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,250
don't have access to them and I wouldn't

431
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,680
be able to talk about it if I did and

432
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,780
number three some of you in the audience

433
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,110
may have noticed that a lot of evidence

434
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:53,970
was pulled from what has taken place

435
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:58,219
visa V Iran notably the competition

436
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:00,180
between Iran and Israel but also the

437
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,890
competition between Iran and Saudi

438
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,160
Arabia and the competition between the

439
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,890
United around the United States so those

440
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,860
are my conclusions heavily caveated and

441
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,890
thank you very much for the opportunity

442
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:23,699
to present to the virtual saikhan Thank

443
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:26,040
You Martin thank you very much for the

444
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,290
wonderful presentation um we may never

445
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,300
know but I think at least many viewers

446
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,139
are currently giving you a standing

447
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:37,139
ovation let me ask you one question I

448
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,450
don't see the audience questions yet on

449
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,180
my screen so I'm giving you one of my

450
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,130
own and that's the following one of the

451
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,260
propositions that is currently missing

452
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,240
from your analysis is whether cyber

453
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,800
operations can also lead to a further

454
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,500
escalation sort of further

455
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,260
intensification during an armed conflict

456
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,030
of course we may not know now given the

457
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,730
limited cases that we could potentially

458
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:04,200
consider if at all but what are your

459
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,840
views on this my views on this is that

460
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,220
cyber escalation is a much richer topic

461
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,209
when you're outside of armed conflict

462
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,120
than when you're inside of armed

463
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,460
conflict in other words I I take it as a

464
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,080
proposition that if there's a class of

465
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,269
targets for which elites

466
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,460
attack is appropriate under the laws of

467
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,169
armed conflict or at least is going on

468
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,990
that any cyber attack is going to be

469
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:30,360
within the realm of permitted in other

470
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:35,640
words if I can take out a surface-to-air

471
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,889
missile by using if I can take out a

472
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,539
service to it if I can take out a

473
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,640
surface-to-air missile using a kinetic

474
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,830
attack I can certainly take out one

475
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,070
using a cyberattack and there is no

476
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:50,370
limit to the cyber attack that can be

477
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,350
carried out that having been said one of

478
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,760
the risks again potential because we

479
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,049
don't have a great deal of evidence on

480
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,360
this that occurs when you use cyber text

481
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,610
cyber attacks in the context of a

482
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,408
kinetic war is it slips outside the

483
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,879
bounds of the war in other words is a

484
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:07,260
conventional conflict which you have

485
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,289
managed to interfere with nuclear

486
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,620
systems there was a gentleman by name of

487
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:15,510
God Ash Acton who's at Carnegie

488
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,820
Corporation whose who's discussed sort

489
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,519
of what it considers entanglement okay

490
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,620
so it's inadvertent escalation to the

491
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,519
I've just touched a nuclear system level

492
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,350
another potential escalation which is

493
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,820
very possible in cyberspace because

494
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,889
systems don't necessarily have the same

495
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,289
geography is that in the physical world

496
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:36,178
is that if it's a localized conflict

497
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:39,840
some of your effects may be non-local

498
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,970
and there is also the possibility that

499
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,649
an attack on a military system may end

500
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,330
up being an attack on a civilian system

501
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:50,219
but at this point everything's

502
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,779
theoretical thank you um I think there's

503
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,200
much more to discuss here but in the

504
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,510
interest of time let us move on and next

505
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,909
up is matthias one of the leading

506
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,158
cybersecurity fingers in germany

507
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,049
matthias is a researcher at the security

508
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,630
division of the german institute for

509
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,629
international and security affairs swp

510
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,539
where he is also the co coordinator of

511
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,179
the cyber research cluster his research

512
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:18,059
focuses on what can be called darkside

513
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,600
of digitization namely the strategic use

514
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,460
of offensive cyber operations in

515
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,949
international security which is also the

516
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:30,180
topic of his talk today please welcome

517
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:32,920
to the virtual space matthias shooter

518
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,840
hi there wherever you are thank you for

519
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,390
giving me the opportunity to present my

520
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,270
research to you at this virtual when you

521
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,010
that we have here so this paper is part

522
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,220
of a study that I'm currently doing at

523
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,879
swp about the utility of military cyber

524
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,260
operations and the backdrop is basically

525
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,780
so cyber warfare has been hyped as this

526
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,070
new all-purpose sword for example

527
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,500
according to kim jeong-hoon the leader

528
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,870
of North Korea or there is a lovely book

529
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,730
by David Sanger out called the perfect

530
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,159
weapon and where he basically makes this

531
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,370
argument that cyber warfare is the best

532
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,440
thing out there to paraphrase here and

533
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,389
many military strategies from around the

534
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,870
world offensive cyber capabilities as

535
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,510
the next best thing as well meanwhile

536
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,209
the academic literature is a little bit

537
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,220
more skeptical there's lots of debate

538
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,380
about the limitations of cyber in

539
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,570
general remember the cyber deterrence

540
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,730
debate where the rough consensus seems

541
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,649
to be well it's not really working that

542
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,179
well but we don't know really why it's

543
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,950
not really working and maybe it's

544
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,780
working at some levels but not at others

545
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,140
and we can't really expect explain this

546
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:41,500
and there is this debate about cyber

547
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,270
corrosion good paper from Erik Ibaka and

548
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,250
Sean Lonnegan where they basically argue

549
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,350
that it's really hard to quarry also

550
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,900
compel anniversary to your will using us

551
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:52,449
alone and then there's a book by Brandon

552
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,820
valeriano it's all on cyber strategy who

553
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,520
highlight the limitations of cyber as a

554
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,500
tool for foreign policy in general

555
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,080
claiming that the primary value of this

556
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,300
tool is not in necessarily destructive

557
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,520
effects but rather in in tacit

558
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,720
bargaining so the messaging function is

559
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,570
more important than the actual

560
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,790
destructive effects and then there are

561
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,830
people like Joshua Rovner for example

562
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,720
basically arguing that cyber conflicts

563
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,059
have more in common with intelligence

564
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,309
contests and if this is true cyber

565
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,620
conflicts operate under other conditions

566
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:27,010
than traditional military conflicts and

567
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:29,169
this left me basically wondering so what

568
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,360
good is cyber under these conditions or

569
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,780
rather what is the military utility of

570
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,219
offensive cyber capabilities and more

571
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,810
importantly what are some of the

572
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,000
limitations of offensive cyber

573
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,340
capabilities and under what conditions

574
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,910
do they work and under which don't they

575
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,100
were

576
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,840
because if we overestimate or

577
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,300
underestimate the utility of this too we

578
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,830
might use it wrong in Germany a couple

579
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,530
of years ago we had two lovely debate

580
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,689
about our German assault rifle the g36

581
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,510
which overheated in the desert context

582
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,550
of Afghanistan so the weapon itself was

583
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,680
fine but we were used it on the wrong

584
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,570
conditions because it was designed for

585
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,610
middle European temperatures and not for

586
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,649
desert or heat scenarios in Afghanistan

587
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,379
so we were basically using it wrong to

588
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,080
paraphrase Steve Jobs here so what are

589
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,090
my central arguments so I looked at some

590
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,189
cases where offensive cyber capabilities

591
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,620
have been used in armed conflict and

592
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,420
here's a caveat of course I only looked

593
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,129
at military cyber operations although

594
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,480
they're sometimes really hard to

595
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,400
differentiate from intelligence

596
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,280
operations so it's not necessarily

597
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,750
clear-cut I ignored most of the

598
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,550
cybercrime which also could be

599
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,740
state-sponsored but but who knows so I

600
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,830
left this out and this you know left me

601
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,260
with a rather short list of incidents

602
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:43,270
and in order to organize this study I

603
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,400
bit they used the three levels of

604
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,740
warfare heuristic which basically

605
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,720
divides military actions on three levels

606
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,840
the strategic the operational and the

607
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,060
tactical level the most research outs

608
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,270
out there so far has been done on the

609
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,590
strategic level so teaching operations

610
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,750
are those that try to influence the

611
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:05,080
cost-benefit calculus of an adversary

612
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:08,440
without necessarily engaging or using

613
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,730
conventional forces so in terms of cases

614
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,100
there's not really a case where this

615
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,770
happened so we have to revert a

616
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,899
hypothetical scenario which is meet

617
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,550
reduce an operation described by David

618
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,980
Sanger in his book that I just mentioned

619
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,290
the fallback plan by US Cyber Command

620
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,290
against Iran in case the Stuxnet

621
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,850
operation or Olympic Games failed so the

622
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,740
idea was basically shutting down an

623
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,560
entire country for a longer period of

624
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,420
time and what they found or what saying

625
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,919
I describes by referring to insiders is

626
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,110
that it turns out that it's really

627
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,820
complicated to do because you need

628
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,159
access to lots of critical

629
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,899
infrastructure and this is difficult to

630
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,980
do because you don't need just one back

631
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,450
to our implant and critical

632
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,010
infrastructure but potentially if you

633
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,840
want to shut down an entire country you

634
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,810
need probably hundreds or I don't know a

635
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,419
couple of hundreds to to create damaging

636
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,889
effects and you have to keep track of

637
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,080
them so you have to know

638
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,000
how these backdoor implants interact

639
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,240
with each other and in what sequence you

640
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,520
you engage basically and you need a lot

641
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,920
of people to organize this and many

642
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,200
countries simply don't have that many

643
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,160
operators that can launch attacks at

644
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,810
this scale and level in terms of war

645
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,460
there's the general problem that was

646
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,379
outlined by Martin libecki a couple of

647
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,120
years ago in one of his books where he

648
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,620
basically argues that cyber cannot

649
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,709
really permanently disarm an opponent

650
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,679
and it's really difficult to occupy a

651
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,360
territory with cyber alone which is

652
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,810
still quite important to win a war

653
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,449
nevertheless likewise you cannot win a

654
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,340
war with just the air force alone as we

655
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,460
have learned in Libya for example or in

656
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,379
Syria and many other conflicts and then

657
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,170
there is this other other issue that in

658
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,870
many conflicts your primary adversary's

659
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:53,170
are those ak-47 wielding low-tech

660
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,520
guerrilla or insurgent forces which you

661
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,130
cannot really disable with a cyber

662
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,750
attack so in conflicts where this is but

663
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,370
this is the condition you you probably

664
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,760
can't use it or the tool is not as

665
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:06,669
useful so what about the operational

666
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,790
level and this is using cyber in context

667
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,890
of our conventional military war or

668
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,889
conflict together with conventional

669
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,110
force and the overall overall assessment

670
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,780
is a little bit better so you can change

671
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,899
cyber plus conventional together either

672
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,580
sequentially so shutting down the radar

673
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,530
with the cyber tag and then coming in

674
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,780
with the Air Force or you do it in

675
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,320
parallel as the Russians for example did

676
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:34,030
in Georgia or in Ukraine and the

677
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,189
challenge is and this is true for all

678
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:39,420
military branches and not you need to

679
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,370
cyber anyway it's to create jointness

680
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,250
it's really hard to synchronize effect

681
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,949
especially if you use proxy actors like

682
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,320
patriotic hackers a lot of countries out

683
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,760
there that use proxy hackers or

684
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,530
organized crime troops and it's really

685
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,980
difficult to organize these into you

686
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,330
know military chain of command style

687
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,980
coordination of attacks so if you have

688
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,300
the military behind you it's probably

689
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,010
easier to synchronize your troops and

690
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,020
singular attacks seem easier to pull

691
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,760
over and then continuous campaigns

692
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,450
because there's a lot of men or woman

693
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,640
power and

694
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,000
often that and it's really difficult to

695
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,130
keep track of what you're doing I only

696
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,500
found is that cyber first strikes at the

697
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,680
beginning of a conflict for example to

698
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,360
generate surprise effect seem worthwhile

699
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,000
that is if you have enough preparation

700
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,639
time and this is an important lesson if

701
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,620
you study cases of non use cyber care of

702
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,450
non use where their capability has not

703
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,010
been used because if you don't have

704
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,720
access if you don't have enough

705
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:41,290
preparation time you probably can't use

706
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,570
this tool and then there's some

707
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,399
indication that you know decapitation

708
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,040
strategies might be working and that is

709
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:52,150
slowing down military communications or

710
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:55,510
networks and this might both might be a

711
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,550
worthwhile effect one of the general

712
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,190
problems is the malware development

713
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,710
cycle because you have to synchronize

714
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,470
your malware development cycle with your

715
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,570
burn rate so this is nothing new in in

716
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,640
military conflict as well if you burn

717
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,929
more of your you're utterly artillery

718
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,190
shells for example then you can

719
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,920
reproduce then you're running out of

720
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,660
ammunition so so you can make the

721
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,250
analogy probably inside in the cyber

722
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,690
domain as well that if you burn more

723
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,600
malware wave or smoke your

724
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,250
vulnerabilities gets patched and you

725
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,399
cannot reproduce them quickly enough

726
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,230
then you lose your momentum so

727
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,450
preparation time is an important

728
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,070
variable we need to look at if you don't

729
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,870
have time if you don't have intelligence

730
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,760
access if you have not prepared the

731
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:40,989
battlefield and cyber attacks probably

732
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,020
won't work that well so what about the

733
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,340
last level the tactical level and there

734
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,410
is not as there has not been much

735
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,659
written about this and this is the use

736
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,400
of cyber capabilities in the field on

737
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,350
the level of individual combat

738
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,330
engagements

739
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,459
so the idea ray basically is that for

740
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,649
example you pair Special Forces together

741
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,960
with IT guys allowing them to shut down

742
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,840
anniversary tech equipment like micro

743
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,730
drones for example or digital personal

744
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,709
assistants of the soldier of the future

745
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:12,280
directly in the field in front of you

746
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:14,500
and if you study instances where this

747
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,629
was experimented with if you find

748
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,820
general issues of deconfliction or

749
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,370
questions of who has the authority to

750
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,260
launch anything is it the troops on the

751
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,239
ground or the battalion level or is the

752
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,190
strategic Kumar

753
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,470
level or even the intelligence agencies

754
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,620
and countries where cyber capabilities

755
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,940
are housed at intelligence agencies the

756
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,770
problem is that and Martin libecki

757
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,290
described this already you have an

758
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,030
inherent risk that cyberattacks cascade

759
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,920
out of control and create strategic

760
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,470
effects may have may be for example

761
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,330
globally if you look at the not petia

762
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,660
incident which basically spiraled out of

763
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,129
control you have to worry about that

764
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,309
tactical operation to I don't know shut

765
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:56,070
down a a video camera and building to do

766
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:58,559
a hostage rate maybe escalates because

767
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,570
you did not anticipate the effects and

768
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,760
this is the reason why in many countries

769
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:05,280
decisions to launch cyberattacks are

770
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,809
made at the strategic level and this is

771
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,580
at odds with you know that the

772
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:12,720
requirements of troops in the fields and

773
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,240
the tactical level lastly if you look at

774
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,059
lessons learned from Afghanistan or from

775
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,890
Iraq for example there's this lesson

776
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,110
that technology fails in difficult

777
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,850
environments in deserts for example you

778
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,070
need radio access you need batteries and

779
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,928
stuff like that and if they ask lend a

780
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,550
meaningful electronic warfare capability

781
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:33,179
you might not be able to use this stuff

782
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:36,059
at all so this is also a restraint or a

783
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,630
limiter for the usefulness of this tool

784
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,160
in these contexts so to sum up

785
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,559
yeah the matter for the perfect weapon

786
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,720
does not hold completely cyber in war

787
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,710
works but only if certain conditions are

788
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,660
met and the realistic finding is that

789
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,160
cyber operations are probably most well

790
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,230
suited for espionage and intelligence

791
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,330
surveillance and reconnaissance

792
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,400
functions but not necessary that great

793
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:01,500
for achieving destructive effects of

794
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,570
course and this is a similar caveat that

795
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,460
was uttered before this might change in

796
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,800
the future as for example training gets

797
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,310
better as synchronization gets better

798
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,639
and as more nurses use digital equipment

799
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,440
on the field so that that is it from my

800
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:22,290
son on my side thank you very much for

801
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:24,629
listening thank you Mattias let me ask

802
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,300
you one brief question and hopefully we

803
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:29,940
can get back to your talk after the last

804
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,889
talk as well on the two key variables as

805
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,500
you mentioned that drive your hypothesis

806
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:36,750
on the utility of cyber operations is

807
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,668
one timing and two operational

808
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,500
complexity

809
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:41,658
could you tell us a little bit more

810
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,879
about this operational complexity in

811
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,639
particular and what I'm looking for is

812
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,009
how much this is really self-imposed by

813
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:55,730
actor conducting these operations and

814
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:58,579
how much is this target related Thanks

815
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,130
yeah so timing I talked about this a

816
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:04,430
little bit it seems easier to launch

817
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,589
first strikes in in conflict so this is

818
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,118
a timing variable the other is

819
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:10,940
complexity and this is you you can

820
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,880
translate this into how difficult it is

821
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,559
to achieve your effects and if you want

822
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,839
you can divide this up further into

823
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,720
further variables for example how

824
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,430
organized are your troops right the the

825
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,500
degree of organization and the

826
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,839
management strategies and so forth they

827
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,730
they impact how efficient you are and

828
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:31,819
how well you can maneuver and how quick

829
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,619
you are there's this lovely episode of

830
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:36,349
the US operation glowing symphony

831
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,450
against Isis which describes nicely that

832
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,309
Cyber Command had to overcome many

833
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,410
bureaucratic hurdles in order to launch

834
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:44,900
this operation and this organizational

835
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,118
variable basically effectively the

836
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,160
operational effectivity of the counter

837
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,809
Isis operation but it's also not stuff

838
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,848
that depends on your organization but it

839
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:57,980
also depends on the target variables as

840
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:00,470
well so for example how hard to hit

841
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,809
something is if there's an air-gapped

842
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,269
system you need to spend more effort if

843
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:08,690
the system is well protected we probably

844
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:10,459
zero day in and you need to establish

845
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,309
them first you need to do some

846
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,650
reconnaissance if you think about the

847
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:17,809
Stuxnet operation you you probably need

848
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,730
to have human intelligence operators in

849
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:22,009
place to drop your speed drives or

850
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,180
thumbsticks and so forth so all this

851
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:27,650
plays into operational complexity and

852
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,808
and this is true for all military

853
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,329
operations in general the higher the

854
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:36,470
complexity the more uncertainty you have

855
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:38,690
in the end thank you

856
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,490
last but not least we have a talk

857
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,829
presenting the results of a year-long

858
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,019
research project conducted by the Center

859
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:47,539
for geopolitics of the data sphere

860
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:49,729
abbreviated geode it's a

861
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,320
multidisciplinary team made of made up

862
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,230
of geographers computer

863
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,510
scientist and area specialist with us

864
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,370
today we have professor friedrich doozie

865
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,950
and professor of geopolitics at the

866
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,710
university of paris and director of

867
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,410
geode she will be joined by louie

868
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,890
Beiteinu one of the brilliant PhD

869
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,600
students working under her wing he's not

870
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,120
only a great regional experts on

871
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,069
regional expert on the black sea but

872
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,839
he's also very handy when it comes to

873
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:21,560
using methods for mapping and

874
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,660
visualizing data redic and we the floor

875
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,040
is yours

876
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,080
thank you very much Anna I would like

877
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,060
first to thank you for giving us the

878
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,620
opportunity to present our research and

879
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:36,529
managing to publish the book on time for

880
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,900
this session so this is really the

881
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,430
result of interdisciplinary work and I

882
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,530
would like to acknowledge your other

883
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:46,190
authors Lachman telemetry on cave in

884
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:51,320
ammonia vessel imagine to go out cos we

885
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:54,530
developed in our team methodology to map

886
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:57,290
the lower layers of cyberspace and

887
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,810
basically to find out the routes that

888
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,230
the data can travel and our main I

889
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:06,020
purposes because we used the border

890
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:09,410
gateway protocol data the main

891
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:12,350
hypothesis of our work was that this BGP

892
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,379
could be manipulated for geopolitical

893
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:18,740
reasons in the context of the large Isis

894
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,700
and that this manipulation could lead to

895
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,859
further fragmentation of cyberspace so

896
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,859
we decided to focus on the Ukrainian

897
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:31,400
crisis and see whether we could observe

898
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:35,300
but also represent this presentation and

899
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,070
since we is such my PhD students I will

900
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:41,330
give him the privilege to present our

901
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:44,210
research well thank you very can thank

902
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,980
you everyone for being here so yes

903
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,720
article is about the measurement of

904
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:52,280
fragmentation of the Internet in Ukraine

905
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,799
during the crisis we started in 2014 so

906
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,990
to understand how we use about a gateway

907
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,480
protocol to do that we have first to go

908
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:02,350
back to how the internet works so can we

909
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,350
have the next slide please

910
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,079
Internet is itself the results are

911
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:09,259
interconnection of tender third and

912
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,450
independent autonomous systems which are

913
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:13,130
networked so for instance internet

914
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,990
packets from this video streaming they

915
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,150
goes from multiple laces from one a

916
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:20,029
years which is my internet service

917
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:23,029
provider or ISP to another one which is

918
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:26,089
eros going through all the way through

919
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:28,609
multiple other races because of the MIMO

920
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:29,990
systems they vary in size and roll we

921
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:32,660
are three main categories which are

922
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,729
famous debug born carriers cheer to

923
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,098
medium-sized Internet service providers

924
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,900
and Tier three which we call stub

925
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:43,029
domains which are guesses at the end of

926
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,029
the network next slide please

927
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:48,680
so why do we studies as autonomous

928
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,150
systems with a geopolitical prison well

929
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,890
it's because they interconnect with this

930
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,740
protocol called border gateway protocol

931
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,990
BGP which can be described as a

932
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,508
political tool because yes operators

933
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:02,180
choose to connect to certain autonomous

934
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,740
systems and not others and when they do

935
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,618
that they also implement routing

936
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,180
algorithm or watching policies which are

937
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:10,130
set up to decide what to do with the

938
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,140
data as a receiver and which they have

939
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,150
to forward in the network and the

940
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,379
choices involve commercial security and

941
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:21,079
political considerations in BGP is also

942
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,599
geopolitical because autonomous systems

943
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,160
are inscribed in space and for instance

944
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,470
when they provide internet access to

945
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,288
specific territories autonomous systems

946
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,299
can be strategic tools so we have a

947
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:35,599
geopolitical context here which is a

948
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:37,400
major crisis in Ukraine in 2014 which

949
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,680
resulted in territorial conflicts in

950
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,230
Crimea and the Donbass and no question

951
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,149
was what what was the role of the

952
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,829
network of autonomous systems in the

953
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,700
strategies of control over the

954
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:51,859
territories

955
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:54,980
next type is and we have a whole system

956
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:57,589
of data collection set up by two of our

957
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,180
authors which I will not describe in

958
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,970
detail because it's rather technical but

959
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,450
it gathers IES relationships around the

960
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:07,578
world and well there are limitations to

961
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,890
this data collection for instance

962
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:12,829
because public bgp data cannot be fully

963
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,868
exhaustive but also because big

964
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,210
decoration ships can change sometimes at

965
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:19,760
a very fast

966
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:23,300
next try please but what we can do with

967
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,760
this data is look at how the Internet is

968
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,070
structure here we have a graph which is

969
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,840
a representation of the network and this

970
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:33,200
is the network of Ukrainian Tulum with

971
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,600
systems and the direct neighbors in 2019

972
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,210
and here we have nodes which are

973
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,759
autonomous systems linked between them

974
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,040
being a yes relationships and the size

975
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,130
depends on their importance in the

976
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,730
network in Ukraine and we can observe

977
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,710
several things here first that the

978
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,300
Ukraine network is a resilient one we

979
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,340
have numerous autonomous systems with

980
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,180
multiple paths that connect to the rest

981
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,580
of the Internet

982
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,680
the second thing we can say is that it's

983
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,910
a bipolar network because Ukrainian

984
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,830
access the global Internet

985
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,710
mainly through Russia or Western paths

986
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:09,140
and the last thing we see and that we

987
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,730
will study in detail later is that don't

988
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:14,089
base in Crimea here are distinct

989
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,580
networks from Ukraine and next slide

990
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,260
please

991
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,600
and if we look at the simplified version

992
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,970
of Ukraine's networks we can see much

993
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,400
better spy polarity because we are the

994
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:28,759
clear-all russian autonomous systems in

995
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,890
red and a Western ball with United

996
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:36,610
States United States I guess is in

997
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:36,609
purple or European in yellow next clip

998
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,609
can we have the neck thank you

999
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,350
and if we look also the distribution of

1000
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,960
Ukraine under the new systems neighbors

1001
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:50,270
by controversia stration wickety that

1002
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,720
Russia plays a big part in the network

1003
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:55,940
of Ukraine however you u.s. the new

1004
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,620
systems or Western as autonomous systems

1005
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:04,280
are increasing in the neighborhood of

1006
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:07,490
Ukraine and next type so why do we look

1007
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,440
at Donbass in Crimea because in - 2013

1008
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,720
Donbass in Crimea are fully embedded in

1009
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,820
the Ukrainian Internet as we can see on

1010
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,759
the left here where we have Ukrainian

1011
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,890
autonomous systems in blue and Russian

1012
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,990
in red we can see for instance that two

1013
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,960
major providers Crimea come and welcome

1014
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,970
are fully integrated into Ukraine

1015
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,590
however in 2019 on the right we can see

1016
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,709
that the separation is very clear and

1017
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,050
furthermore

1018
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,910
most Crimean autonomous systems are no

1019
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,619
registered in Russia and we want to

1020
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:39,660
understand how this incorporation took

1021
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:41,220
place and exploit this so here we can

1022
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,200
see the distribution of our time of

1023
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,629
Crimea autonomous system by control

1024
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,790
registration and we can see that

1025
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,950
autonomous systems based and operating

1026
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,529
in Crimea are more and more registered

1027
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,660
in Russia and the incorporation of

1028
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,910
Crimea into the Federation as a whole

1029
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,368
was a long and complex process that

1030
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:02,009
started in May 2014 and which involved

1031
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,559
for instance infrastructures energy

1032
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,420
supply etc but we also witnessed the

1033
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,700
Russian strategy of the deter annexation

1034
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,609
with various elements such as laying

1035
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:14,578
cables between Korea and Russia in 2014

1036
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:17,130
and 2017 setting of a local branch of

1037
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:20,760
Rostelecom which is the biggest Russian

1038
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:22,740
transit provider and by in terrestrial

1039
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,010
cables equipment and even look at I

1040
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,770
guess P's companies in Crimea and at the

1041
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,270
other hand there was our sanctions

1042
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,210
issued by the Ukrainian government's

1043
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:35,400
against ISPs in Ukraine working in

1044
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,010
Crimea so Ukrainian

1045
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,839
ISPs also withdrawing from dependent set

1046
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:44,490
up next Title II and the result of this

1047
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,839
strategy can be seen here because we

1048
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:50,910
have here's a network of Crimea in 29:19

1049
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,710
and their neighbors and we can see that

1050
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,470
Crimea network is no structured around

1051
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:59,040
three major providers Crimea calm Iran

1052
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,930
diagram in green and that Crimea is path

1053
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,569
to the rest of the internet mostly

1054
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,649
depend on major operation cases that you

1055
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:10,250
can set the center of the network

1056
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:10,250
Rostelecom SBB NIT and pure in in red

1057
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:14,069
next slide please

1058
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:16,500
so the situation with a level of

1059
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:18,390
autonomy systems in Crimea has

1060
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,960
consequences and we can see those

1061
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:23,700
consequences in the shape of cyberspace

1062
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,220
which are visible in other ways and with

1063
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,680
other data if we take a look at those

1064
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,470
two maps they were shown with latency

1065
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,089
data and latency is a basically a

1066
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,939
measure of the speed it takes for data

1067
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:39,119
packets to reach a point on the internet

1068
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,829
and to go back to its source so what we

1069
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,250
did here was take ripe Atlas probes

1070
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:46,380
which are little devices

1071
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:49,230
22 the internet in Ukraine in Russia and

1072
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,120
we targeted to specific locations namely

1073
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:54,330
Simferopol the capital city of Crimea

1074
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,970
and the Wacka Wacka which is a city just

1075
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,850
above Korea's border in Ukrainian

1076
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:02,879
controlled land and the result that we

1077
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:06,600
can see here so how to apology reflect

1078
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,280
geopolitics because on the Left when the

1079
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,690
target is in purple we can take that

1080
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,740
data goes much past Qatar from Moscow to

1081
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,240
what's important

1082
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,819
even from the rest of Ukraine which is

1083
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,790
much closer in space you know the other

1084
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,760
hand corner like a half car we can see

1085
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:27,000
that data is going much faster from here

1086
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,970
than from other parts of Russia next I

1087
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,150
please the last thing we did was a

1088
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,220
longitudinal study of autonomous systems

1089
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,710
in Ukraine and Russia so here we have

1090
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:43,169
four four different dates of the

1091
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:45,930
situation from 2014 to 2018 and we can

1092
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,090
observe three tendencies between Russian

1093
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,700
and Ukrainian networks the first one

1094
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:53,340
being as a breakup and integration of

1095
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,439
Crimea into the Russian networks the

1096
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,070
second one being the marginalization of

1097
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,690
Gambas which is more and more becoming

1098
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:03,930
separate networks and its own and which

1099
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,760
occurs its geopolitical situation and

1100
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,440
the last thing we see is a gradual

1101
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,730
increase in the distance between three

1102
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,430
countries because they are less and less

1103
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:16,890
connected to each other next slightly so

1104
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,450
as contagions we have been able to show

1105
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,430
with this paper that geopolitical

1106
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,020
complete several territories do have a

1107
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:25,379
clear impact on the shape of cyberspace

1108
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:28,020
and it is kz but you should see in

1109
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,970
Crimea and Donbass so well show first

1110
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,590
that they are digital frontlines and how

1111
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,230
they can be important features of modern

1112
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,820
territorial conflicts and the other

1113
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,440
thing that we saw was that the evolution

1114
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,590
of connectivity is actually a process

1115
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,630
involving multiple stakeholders so for

1116
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,390
instance it would be quite easy to see

1117
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,960
the Crimean integration as a current

1118
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,150
scheme

1119
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,400
decided in Moscow but it really is a

1120
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,080
result of action from both the Russian

1121
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,110
government the Ukrainian government's

1122
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,788
private companies and of course local

1123
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:59,190
authorities

1124
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:01,650
so it's probably an imitation to be

1125
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:10,559
careful when thinking about how Internet

1126
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:13,259
destruction thank you very much Thank

1127
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,660
You Terry uh let me start off with a

1128
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:19,589
shorter question and that is about the

1129
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:21,328
generalizability of your case we've have

1130
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:23,339
you have we seen actually any other

1131
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:25,289
countries showing these deliberate

1132
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:28,950
strategies what might be called a

1133
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:34,499
territorial appropriation in cyberspace

1134
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:36,680
as well so I may answer this question

1135
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:39,390
we're what we're doing is we've

1136
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,129
developed this methodology and we're

1137
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,828
starting to apply it to different

1138
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,799
territories to see what happens we

1139
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:49,650
actually did a study previously to this

1140
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:52,799
one on Iran and we actually have a paper

1141
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,720
already that demonstrated how Iran

1142
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:57,690
reorganized the structure of its

1143
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,700
connectivity in order to be able to

1144
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:03,089
disconnect it from the global Internet

1145
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:07,739
and they actually did it right after in

1146
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:11,849
November so we can infer strategies that

1147
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:16,249
can either be appropriation application

1148
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:20,190
of our territory or at least attempting

1149
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:22,618
exerting sovereign control of what is

1150
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,789
country's perceive as the in their share

1151
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:29,579
of cyberspace what is clear is that the

1152
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:32,700
attempts by Russia to disconnect its

1153
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:37,259
intimate the global Internet I think the

1154
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:41,339
last one is in December is clearly

1155
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:44,670
intended at trying to achieve what Iran

1156
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:46,920
has been able to do and one thing we

1157
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,009
didn't present that in our paper is a

1158
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:53,489
measure of complexity of the network

1159
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:55,769
that shows how diverse and rich the

1160
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:59,249
network is and the multiple connections

1161
00:49:55,769 --> 00:50:03,598
it might have so Russia is able to do

1162
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:07,499
this now but it's clearly a strategic

1163
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,339
goal that was good in too low so we're

1164
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:11,729
seeing more

1165
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:17,099
is interested in the strategic dimension

1166
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:19,109
of bgp thank you before I ask the next

1167
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:21,089
question addressed the audience in case

1168
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:22,859
you have any questions for any of the

1169
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:24,749
three panelists now we still have 10

1170
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:26,759
minutes to discuss these three

1171
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:29,069
interesting papers so feel free to

1172
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:32,249
submit anything through the chat and I

1173
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:35,729
will select these questions and address

1174
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:38,038
them to our panelists Nick and cherry

1175
00:50:35,729 --> 00:50:41,279
one more question that directly relates

1176
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:43,859
to the two other payers what degree is

1177
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,380
this work a strong critique actually

1178
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:47,999
against existing cyber conflict

1179
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,099
literature particularly those which you

1180
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:52,890
find in international relations and

1181
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,160
international security what I'm thinking

1182
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,109
about

1183
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,719
are they not looking and maybe myself

1184
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:59,460
including at the wrong thing is it not

1185
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,950
about this potential tit for tat

1186
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,749
dynamics of cyber affect operations that

1187
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:06,029
may or may not occur to you in conflict

1188
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:11,238
but instead about these more subtle

1189
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:13,950
types of activities that may shape

1190
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:17,130
cyberspace these activities that still

1191
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:19,859
can have significant effects but may not

1192
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,269
necessarily be visible especially not to

1193
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:23,160
those who are doing the type of

1194
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:26,609
groundbreaking research that you were

1195
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:29,879
doing so let me give a short answer so

1196
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:31,619
then we can answer as well I think you

1197
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,799
need to look at everything but

1198
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:38,430
definitely some countries have a longer

1199
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:42,079
term vision and strategic goals that

1200
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:45,419
they achieve through less visible

1201
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,969
operations and to be completely fair we

1202
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,190
would we would never have considered

1203
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:53,180
studying this particular mentioned of

1204
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:56,059
cyber operations if we had not had

1205
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,489
computer scientists like Evie selamat

1206
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:03,269
pointing to us that is a very strategic

1207
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:06,329
subject so definitely the HISP I mention

1208
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:09,149
is under studied in the strategic

1209
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:12,599
literature and the the the great

1210
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,029
difficulty is to reconcile the very

1211
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,309
technical approaches with the strategic

1212
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:20,190
approaches and to be able to collect

1213
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:21,090
data very often with tools that are

1214
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,340
absolutely

1215
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:26,960
not designed to do geopolitics in order

1216
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,980
to be able to not only understand

1217
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:36,290
represent it in a way that's

1218
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:36,290
understandable for non-technical people

1219
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,430
mattias and mountain and to bring you

1220
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:44,090
into the conversation

1221
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:47,270
I was wondering for both of you on a

1222
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:50,550
question related to the dyadic nature of

1223
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:53,370
cyber operations utility as well as the

1224
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:55,680
potential for escalation we make them

1225
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:58,319
too we may look at this often from a

1226
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,120
kind of tit-for-tat perspective but when

1227
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,040
we think about escalation think about

1228
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,710
stability think about the utility of

1229
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,050
cyber operations we may want to take a

1230
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,260
more holistic approach and see how also

1231
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:13,890
other actors are reacting to an ongoing

1232
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:16,050
conflict between two other actors going

1233
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,400
in this space what's your view on this

1234
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:23,190
and how should we consider this in

1235
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:27,950
relation to your papers sometimes I

1236
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:32,670
think it's hard oh can you hear me

1237
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:34,919
absolutely okay it's hard enough to get

1238
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,480
evidence on dyadic interactions muscles

1239
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,930
much less try to find out what third

1240
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,610
parties are doing there have been a

1241
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,740
number of false Flags attacks in the

1242
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:49,470
world of cyber most of them seem to be

1243
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:51,479
by one outfit are the GRU if people are

1244
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,620
carrying on espionage to try to figure

1245
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,740
out what's going on in particular

1246
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:59,100
conflict oftentimes that will remain

1247
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,629
fairly hidden so this might be an

1248
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,860
iceberg effect that there are third

1249
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,070
party effects but they're mostly

1250
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,060
invisible or alternatively if you're not

1251
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,570
seeing them it's because they're not

1252
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:11,820
there to be seen but Martin would you

1253
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:16,820
not see maybe one a cry and not Pecha as

1254
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:21,030
one of those type of third party effects

1255
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,890
well it was very visible one acquire

1256
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,500
would carry characterizes pure

1257
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:28,770
ransomware that was not very competently

1258
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:30,980
done not petty is a really strange

1259
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:34,620
creature and as I think you pointed out

1260
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,840
it had unintended effects not because of

1261
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,910
the

1262
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,280
were leanness of cyberspace but if I had

1263
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:42,069
to make a guess it's because I think the

1264
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,040
people who put together the the malware

1265
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:48,520
didn't realize that non Ukrainian firms

1266
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,170
also pay Ukrainian income tax and the

1267
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,210
result was that a lot of folks who have

1268
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:56,490
global operations particularly logistics

1269
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:59,410
operations found themselves out with

1270
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:02,549
malware Laden Ukrainian tax software

1271
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:06,220
which in turn it infected everybody else

1272
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:08,710
so this may be a case and I have no

1273
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,560
special insight into this we're what

1274
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:13,810
started out to be a dyad ended up having

1275
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,620
a lot of third party effects because of

1276
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:19,480
the nature of the attack let me turn to

1277
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:22,000
flee today Kaz I believe she wants to

1278
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,740
she has a we normally say a two-finger

1279
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,650
and a direct comment and then I'll turn

1280
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,779
to Matias yeah I just wanted to point

1281
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,210
that that's definitely a common feature

1282
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:35,200
between the three papers the idea that

1283
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:37,570
it can have unintended effect and and

1284
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,049
massive consequences and definitely the

1285
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:43,090
manipulation PGP have massive effects

1286
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:45,730
and we've seen that in the past with

1287
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,890
Pakistan trying to manipulate BGP and

1288
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:51,430
turning off YouTube or a large part of

1289
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:53,740
the world so the impact the stability

1290
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,450
and security of cyberspace is huge and

1291
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,109
the other thing I wanted to point

1292
00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:02,140
because it's me I mean we didn't insist

1293
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:06,330
on it is what happens with the structure

1294
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:09,460
of connectivity it's not the the BGP via

1295
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:12,190
agreements between a SS or not

1296
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:15,220
autonomous systems are often not public

1297
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:18,670
and are very hard to guess so the idea

1298
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:21,819
of our paper is that we use the PDE data

1299
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:24,370
in order to in fear what is actually

1300
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:33,730
going on and make what's invisible

1301
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:35,529
visible Thank You Matthias right to come

1302
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,930
back at your questions about the more

1303
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,860
holistically of things I totally agree

1304
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,140
with that but there are some

1305
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,600
methodological issues that make this

1306
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:45,609
really difficult to research one is the

1307
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,319
delay of the interaction so there the

1308
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,460
tit-for-tat so to speak and this is a

1309
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,140
matter of the

1310
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,000
bution problem so to speak so how long

1311
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,250
does it take to attribute with a you

1312
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,710
know a certain degree of certainty so to

1313
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:59,830
speak so it's not really tit-for-tat but

1314
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:02,200
it's rather tit and then wait wait wait

1315
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:05,319
wait okay now we are certain it was them

1316
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,730
and then then tad and then the other the

1317
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,490
cycle begins anew from the other

1318
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,240
perspective so the temporal dynamics of

1319
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,770
this tit-for-tat

1320
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,250
stuff are really difficult and I'm not

1321
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:17,109
really sure how how much visibility is

1322
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:22,030
visibility that the states actors or the

1323
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:23,920
diets have in this context thank you let

1324
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:27,270
me turn to a couple of interesting

1325
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:32,530
questions that came in from the audience

1326
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:35,830
the first one is about the potential

1327
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:40,270
ways in which Crimea can respond to the

1328
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:42,250
activity that you in covered by the

1329
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:44,920
research team in Paris

1330
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,960
what kind of countermeasure does Crimea

1331
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,180
or any geographical area facing this

1332
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:58,420
type of modification of its Internet

1333
00:57:49,180 --> 00:58:01,118
routing have to exist one it's really

1334
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,780
hard to answer this question because in

1335
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:08,380
the current situation Crimea as hazard

1336
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:11,740
apparently no wish to to develop

1337
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,839
countermeasures in any way and maybe

1338
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,410
Ukraine would like to gain more control

1339
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:20,799
over the Internet of Crimea rates for

1340
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:24,640
the time beings I have no possible way

1341
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,609
to intervene in this no clothes well

1342
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:33,819
beyond these no closed borders with

1343
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:35,589
Crimea and and to add a second question

1344
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,780
to that you've now talked about one

1345
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:39,670
element of pgb hacking if I'm correct

1346
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,470
and that's diverting local Internet

1347
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:47,589
traffic but have you looked at other

1348
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:49,868
forms of as well or not other forms what

1349
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:51,670
do you mean well for instance if you can

1350
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:53,800
divert local traffic there might be also

1351
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:57,400
potential ways of actually inserting it

1352
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:00,190
with bogus traffic right have you looked

1353
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,310
at duis well yeah sorry

1354
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:06,190
one of the things we noticed about Iran

1355
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:08,759
is that the so there were only three

1356
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:12,760
points of connection between the

1357
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:16,300
domestic network and the global Internet

1358
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,520
but inside the network in Iran we could

1359
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,770
see that the network was very rich and

1360
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,589
diverse so it means that there were many

1361
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:25,599
routes for data that the data could take

1362
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:29,380
so the network itself is very resilient

1363
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:31,480
and this can help also hide cyber

1364
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,460
operations within the network because

1365
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,210
they might be much more difficult to

1366
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,790
track back

1367
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:39,550
I'm also if I can react to the question

1368
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:42,579
I'm saying about how NATO should design

1369
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:44,980
a pro to can counter Russia Iran or

1370
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,900
Chinese activity concerning technical

1371
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,839
Internet infrastructure it's interesting

1372
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:52,569
to reverse the question and ask

1373
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:56,730
ourselves how much of these activities

1374
00:59:52,569 --> 01:00:00,250
are also due to what these countries

1375
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:02,500
receive as a threat to their sovereignty

1376
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:07,839
and the reason why they put these type

1377
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:10,359
of activities in place I believe our

1378
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:14,380
time is up thank you all for tuning in

1379
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:16,150
well they probably won't hear you please

1380
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,640

1381

1382
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:26,259

1386
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:36,099
interesting first session we have

1387
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:39,099
received a little notice that few of our

1388
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:41,710
viewers may have had some issues with

1389
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:43,930
the stream apologize for that they

1390
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:45,670
should now be fixed and hopefully the

1391
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,770
next sessions will run without any

1392
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:49,480
problems

1393
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,970
right as mentioned we'll know her quick
