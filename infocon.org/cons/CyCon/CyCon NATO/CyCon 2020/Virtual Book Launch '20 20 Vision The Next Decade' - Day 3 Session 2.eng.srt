1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,139
welcome back ladies and gentlemen and

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,180
let's get started with the second and

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,130
the final session of not only the

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,920
technology day but the whole virtual

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,710
book launch I am very honored to

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,679
introduce our next moderator dr. Bruce

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,730
Watson who is chief scientist at IP

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:34,089
blocks and an expert in algorithms

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,530
innovation and policy for AI dr. Watson

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,530
please the floor is yours

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,209
thanks so much for the introduction I

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,940
think most of you have seen one of the

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,740
panels that I've been lucky enough to to

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,110
moderate in the past couple of years and

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,270
it's it's a pleasure for me to be back

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,650
again this time and of course it's a

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,470
shame that we're all distributed around

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,300
the world but nonetheless I trust that

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,010
all of the the remote participants will

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,080
be able to get the maximum out of this I

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,590
would also of course very much like to

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,759
thank the organizers the fantastic team

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,700
Mario's in particular he's being one of

24
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,430
the key people pulling this together and

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,900
it's very nice to have a panel of the

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,870
quality that I have the pleasure of

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,520
moderating today as well and so let me

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,850
move on to very quickly telling you

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,460
something about the panel we have the

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,800
fusion a gain of two of what I find

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,130
really to be the the most exciting areas

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,370
of information computational and and

33
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,080
cyber issues globally and these are

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,050
namely artificial intelligence and

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,390
things related to cryptography so we

36
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,830
will be starting with two papers and two

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,260
presentations on artificial intelligence

38
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,048
and will be closing off this panel

39
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,420
session with one paper on advances in

40
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,430
cryptography which I think many of you

41
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,140
also find very interesting and these

42
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,940
things connected a much deeper level and

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,710
we hope to bring that out during the

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,520
discussion and some of the questions

45
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,020
that we get so as I introduce the

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
speakers I'm actually only going to

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,759
introduce the first alters but in all of

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,799
these cases the papers have been written

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,479
with a small team of people so I'll

50
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,189
allow them to say something about the

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,529
additional team members if they if they

52
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,840
choose and the other thing is the format

53
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,700
of this session will be such that we'll

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,230
have each of the

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,910
presentations they're limited to

56
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,410
something on the order of 10 or 12

57
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,239
minutes and then we'll have an

58
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,730
opportunity for some of the discussion

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,019
immediately and of course a larger chunk

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,359
of time at the end of this for a

61
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,400
discussion at the very end so that means

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,959
that those of you listening worldwide I

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,670
would strongly encourage you to also

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,800
already start to throw in your questions

65
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,390
don't be shy and save up your questions

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,519
for the very end it would be very nice

67
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,510
to develop that kind of interactivity as

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,549
we go so we introduce the three speakers

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,410
that we have in this session the first

70
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:52,500
one of course is as you'll find in the

71
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,370
book Archer a lav written off and he's

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,569
one of our staff members at CCDC OE

73
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,030
which means that he's a very familiar

74
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,530
face I think to many of us he's going to

75
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,660
be talking today about towards

76
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,980
classifying devices on the internet so

77
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,160
this is an artificial intelligence

78
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,328
application for classifying devices of

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,859
various kinds he is a PhD candidate from

80
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,910
his knowledge level you you wouldn't

81
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,420
have guessed that you would guess that

82
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,230
he's long past his PhD he's got miles of

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,309
experience and this is one of the

84
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,988
additional things that he's doing as

85
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,540
part of his career obviously at the

86
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,720
university of latvia and he's currently

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,760
as i said a research researcher at ccd

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,130
CEO he focused on web and network

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,660
technologies so the next person that

90
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,239
we're going to be having is another

91
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,609
familiar face also at SCI cotton for

92
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,850
many years now and that's Kim Hartmann

93
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:48,329
okay Martin is the title of the the

94
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,730
paper will be hacking the AI and as you

95
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,010
can tell you know this is something that

96
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,170
firmly fits with two of the things in in

97
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,440
cybersecurity Kim for those of you that

98
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,119
don't know Kim is cyber and an IT

99
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,220
director at the conflict studies

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,139
Research Center additionally a senior

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,120
consultant actually in many spheres and

102
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,650
Kim comes from the background of

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,900
mathematics and computer science which

104
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,540
is as we know one of the the key ways of

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,069
fusing knowledge in this area and some

106
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,079
of the work that Kim has been doing over

107
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,089
the past years involves risk assessment

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,280
of embedded systems forensics of course

109
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,380
one of the other hot topics and secure

110
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,780
development of software which I think

111
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,000
given all of the other covert racing

112
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,390
apps is now an extremely hot topic for

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,320
many areas in the world and then lastly

114
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,090
and certainly

115
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,909
at least we're going to be hearing from

116
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,250
Ljubljana be shy and Ljubljana has

117
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,770
attended as icon in the past so she

118
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,690
looks familiar that's why this is her

119
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,010
first time as a presenter and we of

120
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,219
course hope this is the beginning of

121
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,420
many returns to psyche on in the future

122
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,790
she's going to be talking about recent

123
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,100
developments in cryptography and this is

124
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,080
from the standpoint of her position as a

125
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,750
cyber fellow of mathematics this is what

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,210
the United States Army of cyber sorry

127
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,610
army cyber Institute and also at West

128
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,820
Point so a key academic connection as

129
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,500
well and Viviana comes from mathematics

130
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,480
and physics background so very similar

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,130
as well and has an interest in

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,980
cryptography of all kinds that in

133
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,659
particular the one that will get a bit

134
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,430
of air time today is of course post

135
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,400
quantum cryptography some people refer

136
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,380
to as as quantum resilient cryptography

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,030
and there are a couple of different

138
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,490
possible algorithms for those of you in

139
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,159
the know and one of her favorite areas

140
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,850
is the class of algorithms called the

141
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,680
ISO Genie based algorithms so without

142
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,180
further ado also because I'm the least

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,730
important person on this panel

144
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,440
let me move immediately to switching

145
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,940
over to our - who's going to present his

146
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,310
work to us and as a reminder please

147
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,640
bring in those questions for us thank

148
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,520
you

149
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,950
ok thank you Bruce this research is

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,919
collaborative effort with Roman Graf on

151
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,950
chemo Janero bringing in expertise from

152
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:00,930
different fields and we finished

153
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:04,080
previous session with discussing ICS IOT

154
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,290
honey pots and shodhan and malicious

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,750
non-malicious search engines and this

156
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,520
paper looks at this problem from from

157
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,210
different perspective from observer

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,229
perspective and maybe this is something

159
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:23,310
that we should be moving forward and why

160
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:25,710
does classifying devices matter and we

161
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,400
have new botnets every every year we

162
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,979
have new IRT botnets if 10 years ago if

163
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,890
you said botnet you hear Windows

164
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,140
machines now if you said botnet it's

165
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,510
probably some kind of embedded device is

166
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:44,370
compromised and these botnets are huge

167
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,300
hundreds of thousands of devices and why

168
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,480
they are

169
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,230
well there are devices and protections

170
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,140
Internet

171
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:57,540
somebody find appropriate vulnerability

172
00:06:52,140 --> 00:07:01,560
and exploit it maybe as researchers

173
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,800
maybe as observers we could do some

174
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,180
things preventatively maybe we should be

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,700
looking on the internet for devices that

176
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,300
are reachable even if they are not

177
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,469
compromised not vulnerable not in any

178
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,650
way abused

179
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,240
well reach ability alone increases

180
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,560
attack surface and maybe if we can

181
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,820
prevent Attili do something with it

182
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,820
next button that will be smaller and

183
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:39,630
this is not the new thing

184
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:42,140
scanning happening on huge huge levels

185
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,670
and we saw that with ICS honey pots and

186
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,740
it has been happening almost in the

187
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,910
beginning of the internet and initially

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,070
it was fingerprinting some services some

189
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,400
network stacking to plan implementations

190
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,500
but now it turns it has transformed into

191
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,169
scanning the internet specific protocol

192
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,450
do protocol negotiations or bundle

193
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,570
grabbing and this bundle grabbing just

194
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,880
means we request the device to send that

195
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,800
send us their version hardware software

196
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,200
or some configuration keys and there are

197
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,750
non malicious search engines like

198
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,510
Schroder non census that allows anyone

199
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,170
on the planet to look up already scanned

200
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:29,969
different protocols and this engines as

201
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:33,150
any tools just use few hundred to a few

202
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,040
thousand static rules for example

203
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,459
checking give port is open and if

204
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,880
specific protocol on that port replies

205
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,040
with specific version of the device and

206
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,020
then we can make assumption ok if it

207
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,180
replies with Siemens then it's probably

208
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,260
some kind of Siemens industrial control

209
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,939
device and it's it's it's working

210
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,060
perfectly it's very fast it's very

211
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,880
efficient as long as at least single

212
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,790
room matches

213
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,070
if not all much then if we have one of

214
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,620
you device we can investigate manually

215
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,139
maybe do some active probing if you are

216
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,480
allowed to do it of course and maybe it

217
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:13,180
will take an hour or day or a week and

218
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,889
we get some result maybe we get no

219
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,800
result can we justify it for set of

220
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,269
million devices can be justified

221
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,279
investing million of man-hours to

222
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:30,250
classify a single set

223
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:32,170
nobody can justify this expense so how

224
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,079
the research has been progressing in

225
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,639
this field and there is a big problem is

226
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,130
that every year there are more and more

227
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,769
devices that are different so all

228
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,680
devices remain to some extent but new

229
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:47,560
and more heterogeneous devices come in

230
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,149
and it has been recognized by research

231
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,279
communities there are some some

232
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,250
approaches like automatically creating

233
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,970
classification rules but in general it's

234
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,790
going towards two ways applying machine

235
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,050
learning either to standard scan the

236
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,939
exactly same that Schroder has for the

237
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,399
device that reach about anyone or from

238
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,519
observer perspective but this is usually

239
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,630
limited by University Network because

240
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,910
nobody wants to give access to

241
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,760
researchers to observe like commercial

242
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,819
Network it's too valuable and too too

243
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,040
risky

244
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:26,829
the problem is same as a very common

245
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,569
machine learning problem nothing from

246
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:32,138
from this research can be reproduced

247
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:34,089
easily and we are actually looking how

248
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,370
we can apply it in real life and if we

249
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,589
can't reproduce it easily then we

250
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,010
actually have to invest time to do it

251
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:44,079
ourselves so what has been done in this

252
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,959
research we concentrate on the reachable

253
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,880
devices meaning anyone can send specific

254
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:54,339
packets over the internet and the device

255
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,500
reply what does it entail we scan the

256
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,660
internet for h-2b protocol and this is

257
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,410
not Isis because this is just for web

258
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,089
devices but it is so generic and it is

259
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,760
the easiest and cheapest way how a

260
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,760
manufacturer can implement some kind of

261
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,410
control panel in last few years there

262
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
have been attempts to do

263
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,300
in a more mobile way but still this this

264
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,170
is a default way and it will be default

265
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,010
way for many years to come but the thing

266
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,339
is these responses some are very

267
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,560
different

268
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,870
you can like pick a single feature from

269
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,020
the response and use it to class for

270
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,540
even few so this research defines the

271
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,390
device classes how we acquire datasets

272
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,640
how we label it how we investigate and

273
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,830
select features how we train Network and

274
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,780
how we classify these sets so the number

275
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,510
one issue we need to define class for

276
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,240
devices and every single piece of

277
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,970
research has its own definition and this

278
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,220
is a big problem and in next few years

279
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,900
it has to be addressed we have to we

280
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,220
have to work with same class sets

281
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,360
otherwise we can't compare our results

282
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,840
and the problem is when you define

283
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,110
hundred classes how many of them are

284
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,760
actually different and we from our

285
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,070
perspective it not see that they differ

286
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,950
so much we care about what is impact

287
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,350
who is impact that either it's user or

288
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:23,170
industry or some kind of device or what

289
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,440
kind of the data can be leaked and stuff

290
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,650
like that so we propose very small set

291
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:35,200
small asset we could come up with our

292
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:38,020
ten classes and common web servers that

293
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,310
are not that interesting from kind of

294
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,590
device or IOT purpose network devices

295
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,930
that provide connectivity most commonly

296
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,870
for residential connections IOT

297
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,420
discussed ICS infrastructure device also

298
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,360
we put three old classes that were

299
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,860
abused for for wasting toner wasting

300
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,010
resources stealing data feeds for for

301
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,530
blackmail for whatever purpose stealing

302
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,510
phone communication resources and we

303
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,819
also introduced something that nobody

304
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,069
else does is that we see there are

305
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:17,260
devices that can be categorized or are

306
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:20,050
uncomplete ly and clear because the

307
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,790
features are so sparse that expert could

308
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,040
not classify it we can't expect the

309
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,880
machine learning classifier to classify

310
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,980
something that

311
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,020
but can't classify because the date is

312
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,970
just not sufficient enough so what what

313
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,930
is our neural network so it's it's a

314
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,660
very simple and classical neural network

315
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,170
we investigated features because you

316
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:48,160
can't really take just HTTP responses

317
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,810
you need to take some some some specific

318
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,040
features and that is that is addressed

319
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:57,339
we we have 2018-2019 datasets for four

320
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,540
data sets total we label sufficient from

321
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:04,510
our perspective training set and we use

322
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,089
this data to to look at it so what does

323
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,680
this data show us this data show us four

324
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,630
standard ports that as expected the web

325
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,160
servers are are prevalent maybe their

326
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,650
websites maybe their internal systems

327
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,230
that are exposed and needed Li maybe

328
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,540
something else but that is something we

329
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,980
as as device researcher scares at least

330
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:29,140
for and time wise there are no no

331
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,560
significant changes maybe we see that

332
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,270
the printer class is very stable maybe

333
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,790
we see that phone and network devices

334
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:41,710
are are decreased in in deployment in

335
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,839
wrong deployment and all devices just

336
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:49,780
from their old age expire and what we

337
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,790
see at the alternative port is much more

338
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,220
interesting we see that that web is not

339
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,329
dominating anymore that we see that

340
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,700
alternative port contains much much more

341
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,980
kind of interfaces exposed to the

342
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,230
internet so if you want to target

343
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,540
devices maybe looking at the alternative

344
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:13,390
port is even more valuable and looking

345
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:15,430
at the standard itself and the most

346
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,770
interesting part is that if we put all

347
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,079
these four data sets together if we put

348
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,520
standard the alternative port for every

349
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,800
year and we see that that significant

350
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,069
difference in this way ban on web device

351
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,199
but we also see that we have a huge

352
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,230
number of on categorized and cleared

353
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,600
devices and clear meaning the features

354
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,420
are enough for human expert to say this

355
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,910
is not a website

356
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,949
this is something interesting but it

357
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,779
just does not provide us enough enough

358
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,410
information to make a decision what it

359
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:50,180
is and if you look at other researchers

360
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,540
and they are just classifying it

361
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,750
somewhere what we see is that

362
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,540
proportionally of course the interesting

363
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,829
devices are are more common on ownself

364
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,860
tentative ports and we should be looking

365
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:07,219
there so what what what are the results

366
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,670
lots are that we achieve 87% test

367
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,529
accuracy which is which is amazing

368
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,449
without without the use of rule engine

369
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,209
every every single research that

370
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:20,359
provides better test accuracy used some

371
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,638
kind of rule engine or or some other

372
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,850
optimizations that is that we want to

373
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,940
minimize the interesting part about and

374
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,160
clear and categorized we expected to see

375
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,709
it because we label the set we expected

376
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,920
it to see somewhat proportionally but

377
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:40,130
turns out there are so many different

378
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:45,079
devices that we actually by randomly

379
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:47,930
sampling say the initial data set for

380
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:52,310
labeling we miss them because they are

381
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,140
so rare so far apart and the moment you

382
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,449
you train the network and you put it in

383
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,220
you sees that we are unable to classify

384
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:02,390
this device and this is something that

385
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,100
that needs needs more research this is

386
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,699
something that is observable over time

387
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:10,579
and it's much easier to to address these

388
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,530
issues in future just by by by

389
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,720
monitoring page just continuing it and

390
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,819
maybe some policy and some political

391
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,130
level maybe there is something comes up

392
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,770
that IP camera should be protected more

393
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,919
just because they is invade privacy too

394
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,319
much so for future for future we are

395
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,510
looking at model with these multiple

396
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,980
protocols we looking for a piece that we

397
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,750
can use ourselves and open to other

398
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,960
developers we are just looking at as

399
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,690
much applied use as we can and also

400
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,570
we're investigating may be explainable

401
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,669
neural networks just to understand maybe

402
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,860
we can we can create the rule engine

403
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:49,070
better just to understanding what neural

404
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,149
network does itself so that was over

405
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,149
your the research thank you

406
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,100
thanks very much indeed Artur I'm sure

407
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
if we had the the full audience there

408
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,500
today you'd be getting a very nice round

409
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,520
of applause before we move on which we

410
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,780
will do in just a moment I don't see a

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,400
large stream of questions but I would

412
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,950
just like two pros one of the questions

413
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,990
that I have that arose in this and maybe

414
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,200
you can answer briefly or we can also

415
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,050
say for the discussion later it's

416
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,960
interesting that you of course have this

417
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,120
initial group of 10 categories into

418
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,580
which these were sorted I'm curious to

419
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,810
know your thoughts about whether it

420
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,870
would be sensible to allow the

421
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:37,330
categories to emerge from the data so in

422
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,949
the sense with a vast amount of data and

423
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,139
of depending on the kind of algorithm

424
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,540
kind of neural network you could allow

425
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,120
to to learn and do categorization that

426
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,940
maybe highlights that there indeed 10 or

427
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,739
perhaps 12 categories and perhaps even

428
00:18:48,940 --> 00:19:00,220
some subcategories so perhaps your

429
00:18:50,740 --> 00:19:04,450
thoughts on that you're going to

430
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:07,060
definitely do that but at the moment we

431
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:13,180
see a lot of issues and the issues are

432
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:15,550
that if you look at the data you can

433
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,470
easily even as expert make wrong

434
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,120
assumptions and even machine along a

435
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,730
center makes the wrong assumptions in

436
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,969
the sense that there are embedded

437
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:28,390
software vendors that provide software

438
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:31,450
for every type of device and just just

439
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,580
that already caught us off guard and if

440
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:39,250
he did as that with a small feature

441
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,830
initial feature set that he had we would

442
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,800
have completely wrong wrong impression

443
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:49,060
and we we are following what other

444
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,820
researchers are doing and when they do

445
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:55,230
that something similar and and produce

446
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:59,530
results and we see that for example

447
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:02,860
magically Amazon has I don't know 10,000

448
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,790
ICS devices so what does it mean does it

449
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,639
means that

450
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:12,678
their honey pots probably does it means

451
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,620
that neural network made wrong

452
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,750
assumptions also probably we can't

453
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:24,449
really know what's happening so we are

454
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:27,150
trying to maybe go into more more kind

455
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,590
of expert rules and then look backwards

456
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,309
from what neural networks actually

457
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:34,168
trying to do to explain to us and then

458
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:39,770
maybe we can we can go this route

459
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,770
instead of just going from bottom up

460
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,909
indeed indeed and if I could follow it

461
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,059
up with a very short additional question

462
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,650
and there is I'm just interested to know

463
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,260
whether you think this is something that

464
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,090
might be weaponized we of course are

465
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,480
chronically dealing with asymmetric

466
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,418
warfare in the digital realm cyberspace

467
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,030
and someone else able to then get a grip

468
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,460
on what the possible devices out there

469
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:09,270
are might view this is very interesting

470
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,280
research as well well there was a last

471
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,470
session huge discussion about scanning

472
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,918
who is malicious who is not malicious

473
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:19,020
what is malicious even and we are

474
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,970
looking also at network traffic that we

475
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:25,049
receive we are interested what what is

476
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:27,600
somebody poking and we see every IP this

477
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:32,160
is tens of thousands of requests every

478
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,379
day so it is already happening but it is

479
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,230
happening in a static way static rules

480
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,250
this is just a matter of time till

481
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,990
somebody uses some some model well-liked

482
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,330
unsophisticated attackers they want

483
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,750
simple solution and static rules are

484
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:52,320
working for them they get compromisable

485
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,610
devices anyway so until it is mitigated

486
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,040
enough they are not going to switch to

487
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,939
to some artificial intelligence but the

488
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,520
moments they switch well what we are

489
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,549
trying to achieve is that somebody takes

490
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,650
takes action based of our date and maybe

491
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:11,639
we can go to decision-makers and saying

492
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:14,159
ok we have model we have trained we CICS

493
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,980
devices that maybe is not seen by by

494
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,610
conventional means yet maybe you can

495
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,070
address it

496
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,530
how maybe we can do responsible

497
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,389
disclosure and address it on a network

498
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,629
level at least block blocks access to

499
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:32,700
them even if you can't mitigate them on

500
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:34,080
software level very true well on that

501
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,210
note I think you've hit all of the

502
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,350
interesting points to make a segue to

503
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,570
Kim's talk which is hacking the AI and

504
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,969
so thank you again r2 we'll come back in

505
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:49,530
the later portion of the panel and Kim

506
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:52,919
let's continue with you please yes

507
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:55,410
hi first of all thing thank you for the

508
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,860
introduction Bruce it's very nice to be

509
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,750
with saikhan again this year I hope that

510
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,918
you can hear me and everything as well

511
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,390
and that you're all fine so as you just

512
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,340
said I'm going to be talking about

513
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:14,460
hacking dai and actually this is a paper

514
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,209
I wrote together with crystalloid who at

515
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,419
that time was at the musak saxony-anhalt

516
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,250
as an adjunct professor for artificial

517
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,460
intelligence he's now moved back to the

518
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,169
auditing Garrick University and so

519
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,510
there's so it's not a small team who

520
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:33,630
wrote this paper and basically what we

521
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:36,059
did was we sat together and realized

522
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,299
that there are actually AI systems are

523
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,860
being used in various applications

524
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,540
which is a trend that had evolved over

525
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,370
the past couple of years and we think

526
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,049
it's a trend that's going to even

527
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:51,928
establish itself further over the next

528
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:53,790
decade so looking at the the amount of

529
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,650
application scenarios and especially the

530
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:59,490
type of application scenarios where you

531
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:02,190
have AI systems we feel that there is

532
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,890
not a decent discussion or not enough

533
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:08,010
discussion going on regarding the

534
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,169
security of AI systems so considering

535
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,360
only military applications we are

536
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,660
expecting to see AI penetrating into

537
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,909
fields such as intelligence surveillance

538
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,320
recognizance locust the cyber operations

539
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,910
information operations which is

540
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,000
something we've actually seen quite a

541
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,919
lot over the past year not so the most

542
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,070
prominent example being deep fakes we

543
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,419
should have been used quite extensively

544
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,990
there's actually another paper written

545
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,480
by

546
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,330
your girls myself and Muneera Mustafa

547
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,530
which has been published on that topic

548
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:43,379
in case you're interested in that so we

549
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,780
are also seeing that AI is being reused

550
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,000
in other military applications such as

551
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,860
command and control or semi Ottomans and

552
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,100
autonomous vehicles as well as

553
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,309
autonomous weapon systems so there is

554
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,469
actually indeed evidence around that

555
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:02,428
there is already and they had AI arms

556
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:05,160
race going on and it's something that we

557
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:09,120
need to consider whenever we include AI

558
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,730
in our systems so additionally to the

559
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,620
previously named military applications

560
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,970
there is actually quite a lot of

561
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,550
civilian applications which are even

562
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,490
being used or utilized even more

563
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,260
incautiously simply because most

564
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,380
civilian applications don't have this

565
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,830
hard security scanning for their

566
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,320
applications prior to being deployed so

567
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,790
we are looking at public security

568
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,928
surveillance financial markets

569
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,070
healthcare applications it's the I am I

570
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,870
civilian cyber security power grid

571
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,490
managed management many other things

572
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,879
especially when you move into the whole

573
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:48,360
enormous computing area so these are

574
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,550
just the most prominent examples and any

575
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,559
of these application scenarios are of

576
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,750
high value to civilian governments and

577
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,639
military units and have to be there for

578
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,059
also to be considered as a high

579
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,809
relevance to our modern societies so

580
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:07,440
however this is also what makes these

581
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:09,750
systems as a particularly valuable

582
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,179
assets the cyber criminals malicious

583
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:15,510
cyber actors or generally within cyber

584
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,670
warfare and we just felt that given this

585
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,490
fact it's not being considered

586
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,559
adequately where the discussion is not

587
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,770
enough so this was one of our aims

588
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,320
actually to foster this discussion so

589
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,510
despite this the security of our systems

590
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,639
is under represented and especially in

591
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,480
the public discussion but even also

592
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,550
among decision-makers so although there

593
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,010
have been reports on successful attacks

594
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,678
against AI within academia which have

595
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,870
emerged over the past couple of years we

596
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,510
believe that this is really

597
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,459
a new trend so we are going to see more

598
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,580
of these types of attacks over the next

599
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,559
decade and the utilize attack vectors

600
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,320
range from such attacks that require

601
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,350
little to no technical knowledge to such

602
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,389
that require highly sophisticated attack

603
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,120
vectors which are directed against the

604
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,100
underlying AI system or that useless and

605
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,620
mathematical models so there are

606
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,280
actually examples of for example

607
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,969
clothing that is being used to allow an

608
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,040
individual to become undetectable to a

609
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,780
supported public surveillance systems so

610
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,570
some of the reported results from such

611
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,240
attack vectors are apart from from being

612
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,700
becoming on undetectable to the AI for

613
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,790
an individual there are also been

614
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,880
examples of I think I I was taking a

615
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:37,520
tile a turtle for a rifle so obviously

616
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,830
if you base your decision on on that

617
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:45,260
mistake you can imagine the consequences

618
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:47,360
this may have so the penetration of AI

619
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,950
trail digits based basis is likely to

620
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,689
increase even further over the next

621
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,059
decade as well as or reliance on its

622
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,920
correct identification and reasoning so

623
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,490
this is one of the big issues that I see

624
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,440
with AI support in any technical system

625
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:04,370
is that humans have the tendency to

626
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,320
believe that whatever decision a system

627
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,600
a technical system comes up with has to

628
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,149
be absolutely true because it's

629
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,219
considered to be absolutely technical

630
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,230
and through based on on logical

631
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,210
reasoning and nothing else but the

632
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,030
complexity with the AI systems is that

633
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,460
the underlying you know the underlying

634
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,580
performance of the AI is actually based

635
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,740
on different mathematical models and

636
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,290
it's often hidden in within the layers

637
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,440
so it's it's something that is not

638
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:36,740
absolutely transparent to how the AI

639
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,870
actually made its decision and it is

640
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,400
actually envisioned that AI will

641
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,290
outperform humans and most house

642
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,000
involving percent of the processing of

643
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,620
large data and information high

644
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,350
precision or complex reasoning over the

645
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,270
next couple of years well not exactly

646
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,459
the next years for the next decade and

647
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,650
it's actually something it's a trend

648
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,270
we've already seen and in a couple of

649
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:00,240
fields so we

650
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,190
are relying too much on AI reasoning

651
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,780
without questioning how the decision was

652
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:09,270
being made so given the wide range of

653
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:13,080
applications involving is which is

654
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:16,410
starting it is actually very interesting

655
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,409
that AI has got to this position because

656
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,480
it is it has been prominently noted that

657
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,090
AI has been regarded as being almost

658
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,820
impossible secure to secure so in the

659
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,100
summer of 2019 Microsoft published a

660
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,649
series of materials on the topic where

661
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,080
militiaman stated that in short there is

662
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:37,580
no common terminology today to discuss

663
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,810
security threats to those systems and

664
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,210
Mathematica time and we hope that these

665
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,919
new materials will provide baseline

666
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,870
language so we are actually talking

667
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,510
about that we are we are at the level

668
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,389
where we utilize the technology to an

669
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:54,600
extent in our applications which is

670
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,670
really startling and at the same time we

671
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,889
have not we don't even have the baseline

672
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,600
language to discuss security issues

673
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,190
within those systems so this is

674
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,939
something that we really need to think

675
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:07,620
about and over the past decade we have

676
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,900
with that we have witnessed the

677
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,399
increasing and incautious utilization of

678
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,670
AI and then all techniques and various

679
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,620
applications we whose current

680
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,860
functioning is absolutely crucial to our

681
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,689
modern societies so it is easily

682
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,669
imaginable how malfunctioning of these

683
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,860
systems may have a drastic impact on

684
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,780
civilian lives as well as our financial

685
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,719
markets national security or even

686
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,300
military operations so with an

687
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,190
increasing dependence of society on ml

688
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,750
and I we must prepare for the next

689
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,120
generation of cyberattacks being

690
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,620
directed against these so attacking the

691
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,360
system through its learning and

692
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,159
automation methods and I was the

693
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,050
attacker to severely damaged the system

694
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,690
by altering its learning outcome its

695
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,690
decision-making identification or final

696
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,970
output furthermore AI systems are

697
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,250
difficult to analyze post-incident as

698
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,010
well as integrating real-time monitoring

699
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,600
during the operation as I said much of

700
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,970
the learning and reasoning are done in

701
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,889
what is called a hidden layer and in its

702
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,800
essence that is basically corresponding

703
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,660
to a blackbox model therefore the

704
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,290
discrimination of a compromised from an

705
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,750
on come from

706
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,460
say I systems and in real time is

707
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,620
considered to be very difficult we're

708
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,390
not even talking about mitigating

709
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,209
strategies we're actually talking about

710
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:26,190
identification which is something rather

711
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,080
considered more or less doable for

712
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,320
normal technical systems but for AI

713
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,310
systems we we are not at that level yet

714
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,560
so with its increasing utilization in

715
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,810
crucial application scenario securing AI

716
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,770
system becomes above most importance and

717
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:46,139
we have to think of ways of doing this

718
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:48,960
however apart from wanting to secure our

719
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,720
AAA systems we have found that knowing

720
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,390
knowledge of AI systems vulnerabilities

721
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,150
will also be of high importance to

722
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:00,450
impress to defensive operations so for

723
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,550
an example during 2019 we have witnessed

724
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,350
an increasing urbanization of a high

725
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,780
which has been extensively used to

726
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,459
create deep lakes which are found to

727
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,670
impose a sincere threat to our democracy

728
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,370
worldwide so breaking things down

729
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,740
defects or Dai supported alteration or

730
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,229
generation of media which may then be

731
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,210
spread through various platforms the

732
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,970
uprising of deep place has encouraged

733
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,640
the u.s. DARPA to spend 68 million

734
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,280
dollars on the sole identification of

735
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:34,250
deep things so while it is about most

736
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:36,450
importance to actually identify the I

737
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,070
support disinformation campaigns the

738
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,830
mere identification will not stop the

739
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,840
operation what is needed is knowledge of

740
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,850
how to actually actively stop a I

741
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,590
supported attacks and this knowledge

742
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,480
will become essential to operation

743
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,250
operators and decision-makers to

744
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,190
establish an uphold cyber power over the

745
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,290
next decade so what we did within the

746
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,500
paper was to give a brief introduction

747
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:00,330
to selected AI and m/l methods which are

748
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,520
currently being used in prominent in

749
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,889
prominence and various application

750
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,020
scenarios and we reported on the state

751
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,260
of art of attack patterns directed

752
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,180
against these so while attacks against

753
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,670
Your Honor the underlying I have not

754
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,450
been prominently discussed over the last

755
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,610
decade

756
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,920
it must be expected that these systems

757
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:23,360
will be prominent targets gel to 2020s

758
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,309
and in order to discuss

759
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,040
I systems we need methods to describe

760
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:30,830
the structure their structure and coding

761
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,920
potential and within the paper we have

762
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,928
derived and discussed an attack surface

763
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,700
model for certainty selected types of AI

764
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:40,340
systems and their underlying models and

765
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,309
technical structure we have also

766
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,709
analyzed the implications of AI and ml

767
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,470
attacks for the next generation of cyber

768
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,990
conflicts and we discuss some of the

769
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:54,679
more recent attempts to mitigation

770
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:56,780
strategies so what is so particular

771
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,179
about AI systems is the combination of

772
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,580
being inherently covered so if you have

773
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,410
an attack directed against an AI it's

774
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,750
inherently covered because you won't be

775
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,040
able to see at live human you're not

776
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,570
seeing that your system is

777
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,080
malfunctioning your system is perfectly

778
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:15,350
working it's it's just not reasoning in

779
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,119
the way it should and the combination of

780
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,759
being inherently covered and it's the

781
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,609
fasting impact on society and wide

782
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,030
unawares of AI and ml vulnerabilities

783
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:27,619
make these attack vectors

784
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:31,100
highly favorable for malicious cyber

785
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:32,629
operations so such attacks have already

786
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,399
been witness and are being discussed and

787
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,440
technical and academic communities but

788
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,179
have not reached the public space nor

789
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,889
application developers aware of the risk

790
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:42,109
of the utilization of AI so that's

791
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,540
another issue to really consider is that

792
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:48,168
application developers need to be more

793
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,179
aware when they use AI methods in their

794
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,279
systems or in the systems or components

795
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,379
that they are developing but they are

796
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,240
actually considering too that they are

797
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:59,000
actually taking into consideration the

798
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,209
idea measures that they have -

799
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,760
securities these components so in

800
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,920
despite our analysis it remain difficult

801
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,050
to provide the vulnerability hierarchy

802
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,980
for the a methods that we investigated

803
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,109
as the attack surface models as such is

804
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,850
generally based on identifying attack

805
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,619
vectors which are based on entry and

806
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,799
exit entry and exit points into the

807
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,540
system however the impact of such an

808
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,990
attack vector may vary greatly with the

809
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:29,420
data assets are being targeted so the

810
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:31,819
specific methods utilized or the

811
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,060
application scenario is also having a

812
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,320
strong impact on the actual value of the

813
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,690
attack vector

814
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,250
that's something that we we or generally

815
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,820
that is not considered in the attack

816
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,590
surface modeling well at least not at

817
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,940
this stage it's something that needs to

818
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:51,110
be done in the near future to actually

819
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,960
assess the security of AI systems so we

820
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:56,960
had some findings I would like to refer

821
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,440
you to the paper we had some findings

822
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,140
for CNN scans ans and SVM's and we

823
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,510
actually did manage to establishes what

824
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,509
I would call a weak hierarchy regarding

825
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:13,730
the utilization of these of these four

826
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:15,920
AI methods but as I was had it's that's

827
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,410
a rather weak hair actually it's a

828
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,070
preliminary result it's work in progress

829
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,930
that's needs to be done further but at

830
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,700
least there is it so it's a starting

831
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,770
point so I would like to refer you to

832
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,819
the paper to get more information on

833
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:34,009
that and defining the attack surface of

834
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,530
AI systems has provided information that

835
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,620
needs further information to derive the

836
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,450
application specific risk so currently

837
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,690
only few reports exist on the tax

838
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:48,290
service metrics which is which are not

839
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,060
specific enough TI systems so we are

840
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,800
seeing that these systems cannot be

841
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,080
analyzed by thoroughly investigating the

842
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,150
attack surfaces but internal posing

843
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,740
processing disclosing discloses

844
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,630
particular weaknesses that are a result

845
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,930
of data assets and the methods

846
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,820
characteristics and processes so in

847
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,770
order to enhance the security of AI

848
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,870
systems a common language to discuss the

849
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,940
vulnerability of such as systems must be

850
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,279
installed and furthermore matters to

851
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,880
reliably quantified the susceptibility

852
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,440
society's cyberattacks must be developed

853
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,300
policy considerations being derived by

854
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,590
the AI community show that the need to

855
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,150
harden any I systems against

856
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,470
manipulations and attacks are

857
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,330
acknowledged within the academic

858
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,370
communities but they have to be more

859
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:32,450
prominently discussed by the public and

860
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:34,790
by decision makers as well my goal with

861
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,950
this talk and with the paper in general

862
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,110
is to foster an understanding of the

863
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,950
susceptibility of AI systems to

864
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,070
cyberattacks

865
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,230
how the incautious utilization of AI and

866
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,450
ml may make our societies more

867
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,000
vulnerable as well as in all of the

868
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,129
value of knowledge of the pack hypercube

869
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,590
peculiar vulnerabilities of such systems

870
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:59,180
and defensive operation operations

871
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:02,750
within yon going a armed arms race as a

872
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,580
conclusion it must be noted that AI

873
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,650
systems are indeed susceptible to

874
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,350
cyberattacks and that the utilization of

875
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,900
AI methods increases any applications

876
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,020
vulnerability and I'm I'm happy to

877
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,000
rephrase or to restate that I'm

878
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,650
absolutely sure at this point if you use

879
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,010
AI within your system without

880
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:24,260
considering its security impact on your

881
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,860
overall software component or your

882
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,140
overall device you are increasing your

883
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,330
applications vulnerability and this is

884
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,120
something that is has cannot be

885
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:37,850
rephrased enough in order to actually

886
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,009
make the point and it really reaches for

887
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,270
a more sensitive use of AI and ML

888
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,450
methods and security and safety

889
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:46,970
sensitive Africa applications so given

890
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,370
the antipas a anticipated of eutychus

891
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,930
utilization of AI and ml and

892
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,210
applications over the next decade the

893
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:55,279
already existing diversity of attack

894
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,640
vectors and current inferiority of our

895
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,350
countermeasures is a really alarming and

896
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,790
the defense of AI systems is yet at its

897
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,710
beginning and urges for further

898
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,830
investigations of the specific

899
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,780
vulnerabilities of these systems so in

900
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:11,299
the context of the political challenges

901
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,280
and Yung going a iron arms race a

902
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,050
profound knowledge of our systems

903
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,140
vulnerabilities must be established to

904
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,750
uphold cyber sovereignty so that is my

905
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,730
concluding statement on the topic I hope

906
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,650
that you are all in figuring now to

907
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,840
actually read the paper because there

908
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,640
the technical stuff is in the paper I'm

909
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,350
very sorry that it did not fit within

910
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,129
the ten minutes I was supposed to speak

911
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:37,569
good I hope you liked it so thank you

912
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:40,640
for listening and I'm glad to be here

913
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,970
thanks very much Kim a very big round of

914
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,830
applause as well from bullying and it

915
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,569
was a pleasure to hear a comprehensive

916
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,549
treatment of this or at least as

917
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,800
comprehensive as we could fit into the

918
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,630
time allowed and a tiny bit more than

919
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,220
the time allowed so I really encourage

920
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,740
people with questions out there to

921
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,649
stream them to us before we continue

922
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,299
with our last speaker I would however

923
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,830
just like to very quickly ask you

924
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,680
something Kim

925
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,630
and and that is to just you know get

926
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,210
your opinion on one of the things that

927
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,610
relates to AI security that you didn't

928
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,740
explicitly mention but you know we have

929
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,810
previously briefly talked about and that

930
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,540
is the possible vulnerability through

931
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:22,730
training data in the beginning so of

932
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,220
course I agree that they're the biggest

933
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,990
attack surface is AI systems once

934
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:30,680
they're in play and installed and part

935
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:33,080
of larger decision-making processes once

936
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,440
and hopefully if we managed to solve

937
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,910
that we will then face the potential

938
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,560
problem that someone can pollute the

939
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,990
training data in the first place and

940
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,860
that might be a more insidious place to

941
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:49,419
to subvert or hijacked a AI do you have

942
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:54,020
perhaps a quick thought on that and

943
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:56,060
connecting back to your talk as well so

944
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,740
first of all yes thank you very much for

945
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:02,060
reminding me of that point it's actually

946
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,890
a big point in in the paper so looking

947
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,990
at AI systems you have different types

948
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:09,470
of systems so yeah either you can have a

949
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:12,169
system where you actually have the AI

950
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:15,830
being trained but data before being

951
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:18,740
before it is actually deployed but you

952
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:20,630
can also have III system where the

953
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,180
training is actually being performed

954
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:26,560
while the system is also already being

955
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,480
in operation so of course if you have

956
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,190
data being manipulated during the

957
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,660
training that will of course affect the

958
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:35,270
decision-making and it's something that

959
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,480
is very hard to detect unless you have

960
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:42,470
methods installed that verify that the

961
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,910
data you are feeding into your AI are

962
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:49,240
not being being manipulated which is

963
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:52,220
something that is not done generally

964
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,680
currently and it's it's actually a

965
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,589
problem that gets even worse when you

966
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,020
look at systems that are being trained

967
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:02,120
while in operation because during that

968
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,350
that it really comes in to technical

969
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,330
challenges because you will have

970
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,430
problems with attacked and with

971
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,130
identifying this attack factor while it

972
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:12,259
is being done and keeping the system

973
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,630
running so it's it's a big challenge for

974
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,710
systems that are working on people that

975
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,780
are being pre tain

976
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:21,050
trains and then operators but

977
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:23,090
it's a really big problem a really big

978
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:29,210
issue for those systems which are

979
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:32,330
training true during operation indeed

980
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,860
indeed okay I think we could talk much

981
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,420
longer about this that I would encourage

982
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,920
people to get their questions in and

983
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,600
finding that of course don't forget that

984
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,240
our speakers are the kinds of people who

985
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,529
will engage you by email if you do have

986
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,439
questions that you didn't remember to

987
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,720
get in so without further delay let me

988
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,210
please move on to our last speaker who's

989
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,370
not talking about AI but a lot of the

990
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,990
the cryptographic primitives including

991
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,480
cryptographic primitives relating to

992
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,129
post quantum cryptography actually have

993
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,160
a role to play in the security of many

994
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,050
kinds of systems either via obfuscation

995
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,140
and normal cryptography or via

996
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,520
signatures and so it's with with

997
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,230
pleasure that I introduce - now to

998
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,590
Ljubljana who's going to tell us about

999
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:15,770
recent developments in cryptography

1000
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:17,930
please labhyate thank you Bruce so this

1001
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:20,840
thing is the joint work with curtain

1002
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:25,750
angle ball which is the director of our

1003
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,750
Institute so next slide please

1004
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:37,400
next so I'll start with some motivation

1005
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:39,560
why here interesting so as a lot of you

1006
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,490
might know how know computers are

1007
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,529
exciting I'll try and also means that

1008
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:48,799
we'll take a new approach to processing

1009
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:51,140
information and failing to reverse marry

1010
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,230
break smooth in variety of things such

1011
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,480
as material science drug discovery of

1012
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,720
the ization of complex systems and

1013
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,670
artificial intelligence but for people

1014
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,230
like me who work in cryptography they

1015
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:10,690
actually pose a threat because a lot of

1016
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:13,880
you might know there is sharp algorithm

1017
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:17,450
so Peter shor in 1994 he wrote a paper

1018
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:21,340
which basically described how the next

1019
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:24,620
is likely how quantum computers can

1020
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:26,600
break all the discrete log problem

1021
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,650
which is basically the underlying

1022
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,650
problem in

1023
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,910
public-key cryptosystems that we'll use

1024
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,799
nowadays so this is the this is quite a

1025
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:42,180
big low threat for cryptographic

1026
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:45,359
purposes because this algorithm can

1027
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:50,519
actually solve this critical problem in

1028
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:52,739
exponentially faster than another so

1029
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:55,529
basically public key cryptography in the

1030
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:58,259
quantum world will public key

1031
00:44:55,529 --> 00:45:00,960
cryptography is we know nowadays will be

1032
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:04,140
not valuable so we cannot use it anymore

1033
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,239
and so this is for public key now one

1034
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,720
other question that people might ask is

1035
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:12,869
ok do quantum computers pose a threat to

1036
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,410
private symmetric key cryptography next

1037
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:17,819
slide please

1038
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:20,819
and the answer to that is also yes

1039
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:23,130
so Grover's there is another algorithm

1040
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:25,319
which can be implemented in quantum

1041
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:30,960
computers which is known as perverse

1042
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:36,450
algorithm which this algorithm makes a

1043
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,450
drop it up in solving problems that will

1044
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,368
break symmetric key cryptography but the

1045
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,939
good news for symmetric key cryptography

1046
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:47,369
is that Roberts algorithm just poses a

1047
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,460
quadratic speed-up not an exponential

1048
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:52,670
one so that means that by we can still

1049
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,380
use the same type of crypto systems and

1050
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:58,950
we will have the same security that we

1051
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,859
have nowadays by just increasing the key

1052
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:04,710
size so basically we can still use this

1053
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:06,859
crypto systems just increase the key

1054
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:11,690
sizes next slide please

1055
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:15,450
so in 2015 NSA made an announcement that

1056
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:18,210
we should start preparing for the

1057
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:20,939
quantum era and come up with a new type

1058
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:24,539
of crypto systems that will be resistant

1059
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,009
to upon two more computers and next

1060
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:29,579
slide please

1061
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:33,569
NIST in 2016 they announced competition

1062
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:35,730
that requires people to submit they to

1063
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:38,069
submit quantum resistant crypto systems

1064
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,620
so this has been next slide please

1065
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:44,310
this process has been going on since 2

1066
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:52,470
thousand 16 and now we are in what is

1067
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:55,230
called the round 3 of this round 3 of

1068
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,839
this process basically which what that

1069
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,630
means is that a lot of in this first

1070
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,750
stage they're submitted 69 algorithms

1071
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,930
mostly for key exchange these algorithms

1072
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,310
are obviously for public key

1073
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:12,299
cryptosystems and mostly for key

1074
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:14,490
exchange and digital signatures and from

1075
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,140
the 69 that were submitted in the first

1076
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:22,259
stage now we have 26 crypto systems 19

1077
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,690
of them are for public key for key

1078
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,740
exchange and 7 of them for digital

1079
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:32,130
signatures and needs the people who work

1080
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:36,899
at least they believe that this stage

1081
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:40,680
will take up to 2021 and then they will

1082
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:44,760
decide in one or two type of crypto

1083
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:48,140
systems that will be used in a possible

1084
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,810
in a post partum world next slide please

1085
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,700
so this type of crypto systems are the

1086
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,150
mathematical problems that this type of

1087
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,430
crypto systems are based are split into

1088
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,650
five categories one of them is code

1089
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,600
based and these categories are called

1090
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,000
code based cryptography multivariate

1091
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:11,610
cryptography what is faced harsh based

1092
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,950
and the fifth but not last it's a

1093
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:17,520
socially based cryptography so these

1094
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:20,580
type of criticism categories have

1095
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,640
advantages and disadvantages they vary

1096
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:26,520
in performance measurements and also in

1097
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,920
maturity so some of these schemes are

1098
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,020
considered well understood and there is

1099
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,210
a general agreement on the required

1100
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,420
security parameters but some of them are

1101
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:39,660
not as well understood they are more

1102
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,610
recent and the exact security that they

1103
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,390
provide is still under investigation

1104
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:50,070
and one of these schemes that is

1105
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:52,410
considered as more recent and it's still

1106
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,380
under a lot of investigation is the

1107
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,540
fifth category

1108
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,900
Jesus oh Jenny base category so this

1109
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,990
category is basically based on elliptic

1110
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,560
curves so people who worked in elliptic

1111
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,720
curve cryptography they when we started

1112
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,690
talking about post quantum crypto

1113
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,879
systems one natural question to ask was

1114
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:17,800
okay can we leverage ellipticals into

1115
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,630
can we somehow leverage them and coming

1116
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,090
up with some type of crypto system that

1117
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,880
will be resistant to computers and the

1118
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:27,580
answer is yes and the good news about

1119
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,910
this new croteau systems that are based

1120
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,730
on ellipticals is that in a similar way

1121
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,920
as classical elliptic curve cryptography

1122
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,510
which provides very short keys compared

1123
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,420
to any other type of crypto systems

1124
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:43,090
these post quantum cryptography crypto

1125
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,640
systems also provide very short keys

1126
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,890
compared to all other types of crypto

1127
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,629
systems but again keep in mind that as I

1128
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:54,339
said previously these are considered as

1129
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,440
new schemes and a lot of people are very

1130
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,410
skeptical so there is still a lot of

1131
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,800
work being done in this area next slide

1132
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,430
please

1133
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:06,820
so this is also my area of research I

1134
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:10,540
come from a background mathematical

1135
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:13,000
background in algebra occurs and what

1136
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:20,410
algebraic curves basically algebraic

1137
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:23,470
curves are just they are we can think

1138
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:26,350
about them as the solutions to the

1139
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:29,680
equations that we see in the slide there

1140
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:32,200
this that I denote with L which is y

1141
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:37,000
square is equal to X cube plus ax plus B

1142
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:39,189
this is one this the simplest example of

1143
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,490
an algebraic curve which we call it an

1144
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,410
elliptic curve so what we do is once we

1145
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:47,229
have an equation like this y square is

1146
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:50,379
equal to Q B then we look at the

1147
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:52,630
solutions of this equation of this

1148
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,240
polynomial basically and all the points

1149
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:58,180
that satisfy this polynomial we put them

1150
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,129
in the set and then we define some

1151
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,049
addition that we can explain

1152
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:04,690
geometrically very nicely for elliptic

1153
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:07,230
curves and they form what is called a

1154
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:12,790
group next slide

1155
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:16,090
and so now to do to leverage elliptic

1156
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:20,460
curves for postponed cryptography what

1157
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:23,140
we do is we look at different type of

1158
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,530
elliptical so different polynomial

1159
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,450
equations and we look at some maps that

1160
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:32,020
go between these polynomials and these

1161
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:34,419
maps we call them I so J maps and for

1162
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:37,270
ellipticals this we know how to do this

1163
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,530
we know how starting from one elliptic

1164
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:40,330
curve we know how to go to another

1165
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,310
elliptic curve using these are certain

1166
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,440
ease of course these are considered very

1167
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:48,370
difficult problems to figure out this

1168
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,680
isogen ease but this is known how to how

1169
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,910
to be done for the case of ellipticals

1170
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,450
next slide please

1171
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:58,600
so now the interesting part or what we

1172
00:51:55,450 --> 00:52:00,879
do is we start with one elliptic curve

1173
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,490
and then we use these maps that we call

1174
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,830
isogen ease and we get another elliptic

1175
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,140
curve and then we use the same map and

1176
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:10,390
we get other ellipticals and so this way

1177
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:14,920
we get this graph which we call them

1178
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:17,109
expander graphs and they eat they are

1179
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,230
called expander graphs from the name

1180
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:24,660
also they expand very quickly and so to

1181
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:27,310
do the next slide please

1182
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,589
so basically here is a very simple

1183
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,509
example of an expander graph we start

1184
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:33,370
with one elliptic curve we can

1185
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:36,190
characterize ellipticals but this number

1186
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:40,509
so 93 is one elliptic curve and then we

1187
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:42,640
the edges here are diogenes between

1188
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,020
these ellipticals and so we get this

1189
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,480
expander graphs and we use them to

1190
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,400
determine

1191
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,570
diffie-hellman key exchange using these

1192
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,510
graphs next slide please

1193
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,910
so how is it done if you are seeing

1194
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:00,040
diffie-hellman key exchange in the past

1195
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:04,060
this is very similar to diffie-hellman

1196
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:07,180
key exchange as it's done for elliptic

1197
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:10,600
curves or also RSA the only difference

1198
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:15,460
is that now the main function here is

1199
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:18,490
not it's this the way that we exchange

1200
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,380
the keys is by getting some paths

1201
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:23,850
this isoh journey grass which is very

1202
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,850
big next slide please

1203
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,550
but elliptic curves elliptic curves they

1204
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:33,189
are very very cool but they have they

1205
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:36,430
have some drawbacks in performance and

1206
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:39,040
so when when we have this problem that

1207
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:41,109
ellipticals have some drawbacks for

1208
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,840
people who work in algebra occurs the

1209
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:47,950
the next the most natural question to

1210
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,780
ask is ok can we somehow use curves with

1211
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:55,270
higher degree which we call them micro

1212
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:58,240
ellipticals to to solve these drawbacks

1213
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:01,900
and the answer to that is yes we can

1214
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,419
actually use higher degree curves to

1215
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:09,730
solve these drawbacks next slide please

1216
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:12,760
so let's real quickly here I will say

1217
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,650
that the hyper elliptic curve is a curve

1218
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,680
that is given by this polynomial

1219
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,240
equation y square is equal to now if you

1220
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,919
look at the right hand side of this

1221
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,618
polynomial we don't have a degree three

1222
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,960
anymore but we have a degree six so

1223
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:28,840
these curves are more complex curves

1224
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,630
than ellipticals but the nice thing is

1225
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:35,470
that these complex curves can be split

1226
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:39,220
up into ellipticals so what we do is we

1227
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:41,430
start with one hyper elliptical and then

1228
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,549
we can split it up into many other

1229
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,850
ellipticals

1230
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:48,460
by using these isotonic maps and the

1231
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:50,799
idea is that when we look at elliptic

1232
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:53,619
curves we have one azure journey between

1233
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,050
these maps when we have when we look at

1234
00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:58,869
hyperelliptic cars let's say in one case

1235
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:01,780
we say Viper elliptical splits into two

1236
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:05,380
ISO journeys then we have 15 more

1237
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,540
ellipticals here and so what we did in

1238
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:10,390
this paper is we looked at hyper

1239
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:13,119
elliptical and we looked at a specific

1240
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:16,270
class of how they split into this

1241
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:19,780
category and what we're interested is in

1242
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:25,119
looking how many isogen is do they

1243
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:30,670
actually split and is this is will this

1244
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:35,109
be much better for much faster

1245
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:36,940
to leverage this type of curves

1246
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:39,609
basically for ISO Jenny based

1247
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:42,940
cryptography so okay I see my time is

1248
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:46,538
over I can go talk more about this I

1249
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:50,819
went a little bit briefly but I think

1250
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:54,039
I'll stop here just by one minute

1251
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:55,808
thanks so much Olivia I'm it would be a

1252
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,450
pleasure also to continue listening to

1253
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:59,680
to all of these topics so no question

1254
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,799
about that

1255
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,890
maybe we can very briefly see if there

1256
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,920
are questions coming from the outside

1257
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:11,828
that that need to be addressed and just

1258
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,410
before we go to that I can also throw in

1259
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:17,589
one of my own questions related to post

1260
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:19,328
quantum cryptography and that is you

1261
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:22,328
know as as we've talked before ljubljana

1262
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:23,289
about the the notion of signatures that

1263
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:26,500
are based on many of the same

1264
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:28,329
cryptographic principles and signatures

1265
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,579
are then used all over the place they

1266
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:34,059
also have potential use in the security

1267
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:35,680
of AI systems where it would be nice to

1268
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:38,920
sign them and make sure that they're not

1269
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,808
tamper proof do you ever feel for and I

1270
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,450
say this specifically to Ljubljana do

1271
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:46,029
you have a feel for how long it will

1272
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,899
take before we have adequate signature

1273
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:50,799
based systems from any one of the

1274
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,259
possible outcomes of the NIST

1275
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:57,220
competition or perhaps something coming

1276
00:56:53,259 --> 00:57:02,130
in completely from the outside so the

1277
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:05,828
best scenario would be I would say maybe

1278
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:08,200
seven to seventeen years so I'm saying

1279
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:12,099
this basically it will take me at least

1280
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:16,299
two more years to come up with what they

1281
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:19,029
think that is the bet not is I should

1282
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,380
say are because they have announced that

1283
00:57:19,029 --> 00:57:23,470
they've made the announcement that they

1284
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:26,470
will choose more than one crypto system

1285
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:28,689
so it will take them at least two more

1286
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:31,750
years to come up with that and then in

1287
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:34,059
the past years to deploy to new type of

1288
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:36,759
crypto system it has taken five to 15

1289
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:39,039
years of course these crypto systems

1290
00:57:36,759 --> 00:57:41,319
these new methods they are all much more

1291
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,279
complex than anything else that we've

1292
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,250
done so far

1293
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:46,920
so

1294
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:49,170
my feeling is that even though in the

1295
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,810
past that take on five to 15 years I

1296
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:55,530
think that it will take much more for

1297
00:57:51,810 --> 00:58:02,220
this but how much longer I'm not exactly

1298
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:03,570
sure but at least I am oh yeah that's

1299
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,850
probably the million-dollar question of

1300
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:09,300
course and we should also be realistic

1301
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:11,009
that many of these are are based on as

1302
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,500
you say very difficult mathematical

1303
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:16,530
problems and the key is to to find one

1304
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,000
that's either provably difficult or we

1305
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,740
have confidence that because no one else

1306
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,200
has found a solution for example in

1307
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,779
factorization that it's therefore

1308
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,189
believed to be difficult or neither

1309
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:29,340
classical or quantum computing

1310
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:32,610
maybe we can very quickly then also take

1311
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:36,120
that too - Kim you know whether or not

1312
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:38,520
signatures are then at all a viable way

1313
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:41,220
of plugging some of the holes as you say

1314
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,410
in the hack ability of AI and classical

1315
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,480
signatures would be easy to do but with

1316
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,560
the looming quantum threat we we now

1317
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,660
know that that's not going to be enough

1318
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:57,360
so of course the question is what do you

1319
00:58:51,660 --> 00:59:01,170
want to just to sign so of course if you

1320
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:03,450
were able to sign the system which is

1321
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,910
being operated so so the problem with AI

1322
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:10,410
is actually that - CI AI system being

1323
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:14,100
operated will always have some changes

1324
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:16,170
so it will always outer in a way because

1325
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,720
that's that's basics now it's it's not

1326
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:21,960
going to change it shouldn't change the

1327
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,600
way it is making decisions so the basic

1328
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,850
concept starters that are being used

1329
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,029
should remain the same throughout the

1330
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:31,890
operation but of course know it doesn't

1331
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:33,360
always have to apply there there are

1332
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:36,440
systems which are actually adaptable

1333
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,490
system so they adapt to whatever its

1334
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,740
surrounding there are being put into so

1335
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,770
with those systems you probably won't be

1336
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:47,459
happy with signing the model or the base

1337
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:49,500
system that you that you developed but

1338
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,590
of course if you are now looking at an

1339
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,770
system that is actually being used in a

1340
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:57,140
more classical way of AI so you have the

1341
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,759
your pretend potato which you'd use for

1342
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,450
pre-training and then you move on to

1343
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:04,640
operation that may be a good idea to

1344
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:07,129
sign that type of system but as you as

1345
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,040
you see from my answer you really have

1346
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:11,690
to look at what what what system are we

1347
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,270
looking at and what methods are you

1348
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:20,200
using so it will be so the answer will

1349
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:23,240
be it depends as often we didn't say I

1350
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,029
think that's a very good point for us to

1351
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,770
to end the discussion not because we are

1352
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:31,460
at the end of the discussion but because

1353
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:33,110
we have no time available for a very

1354
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,580
nice continuation of that so I would

1355
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:37,400
encourage any of you interested to

1356
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:39,080
rather take this to email with any of

1357
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,480
the panelists and with me as well

1358
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,549

want hardcopy well now know we really

1387
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,750
wanted to have this as a conference we

1388
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,670
were even considering having a virtual

1389
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:08,240
conference but we quickly scrapped the

1390
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:11,180
idea why saikhan

1391
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,399
is a different conference while I agree

1392
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,049
many conference in the world can be done

1393
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,690
in a virtual format this is almost the

1394
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:19,700
same way as in-person cyclone has that

1395
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,790
special wide you all know that it cannot

1396
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,410
be defined is it the icebreaker is it

1397
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:25,880
midnight telling city streets I don't

1398
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:27,920
know but it's it's there and no matter

1399
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,140
what your bandwidth psyche on why

1400
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,480
doesn't travel in a digital format it's

1401
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:34,910
just there so we're hoping that the

1402
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:39,200
sharpest mind in the world medicine will

1403
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:42,200
defeat co19 pandemic that next year

1404
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,210

1405

1407
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:56,149
one more thing what's the theme drum

1408
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:59,780

1410
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:06,160
