morning across the whole cyberspace

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,030
this year's icon is the proof that

24
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,890
cyberspace has no borders

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,619
we are already expanding beyond the

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,009
borders of the future although the

27
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:33,429
spacex dragon final accusation yesterday

28
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:37,240
showed that we still do not control the

29
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:40,000
weather in this cell together with our

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,810
distinguished speakers we are going to

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,810
explore the 2020 vision towards the next

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,429
decade and the security challenges of

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,890
the critical infrastructure and

34
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:54,130
industrial control systems from the

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:59,109
perspectives of technology governance

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,859
and cyber conflict Thank You saikhan for

37

saving the best for the last

38
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:08,440
welcome to the technology day before we

39
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,590
dive into the session I would like to

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,180
introduce some house rules in due time I

41
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,150
will introduce our distinguished

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,480
speakers we will initially start with

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,569
two accepted paper presentations 15

69
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,899
we were sure that the partnership of

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,669
different sectors of Brazil in productor

71
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,400
of the article rapid in the elaboration

72
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:45,250
of the work who fell we found to

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,260
discipline and revision next please the

communication networks will no longer be

81
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:10,599
sufficient as an increase in the number

play action roles in Hippias in his

84
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:18,250
mantra scenario we have the inclusion of

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,449
new layers of agents in the structure of

86
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,260
a DPS long span the EPA sectors such as

87

utility companies customs operators

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,539
regulators that can be classified as the

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,880
first layer of a changes the second

90
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,650
layer would cover new classes of ages

91
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,530
that they are beginning to participate

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,378
in the elaborate a new system such as

93
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,929

attacks against thousand of millions of

101
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,740
them can lead to EPS in caves during the

102
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,479
increase dependence of EPS or this is

103
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,699
more agents please next slide the

104
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,190
growing interdependence between quit Co

surfaces event of the attack effects and

111
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:33,240
the feasibility of remote attacks

without immediately immediately response

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,330
here two attackers are likely to

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,639
reinforce the motivation for several tax

common motivation for cyber attacks that

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,440
could aim to close a large scale

at any time next slide please

123
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:09,628
this new scenario was stirred indeed as

124
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,969
a proposed of The Artful with the

125
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,580
finally the finally a dramedy

126
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,620
that must be faced in order to prepare

127
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,650
to establish a satisfactory level for

128
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,169
EPS protection it's clear that they are

129
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,628
many other challenge but we believe that

130
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:28,198
this Charles indicated in our work that

131
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:31,199
involves process people in technology

132
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,960
that indicated us would be the most

133
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,810
important it is important to highlight

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,029
their they they are not exclusive they

135
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,879
are not in order in order of free energy

the first strategies to rethink the

00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,990
hearts I'm skint approach this approach

142
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:04,170
employs essential sub security tools but

143
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,860
they are not enough to eat before EBS if

144
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:10,320
they fail sometimes fail some critical

145
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,380
elements of the system may be left

146
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
unprotected sub security policy is

147
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,020
strategy strategies must consider the

148
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,320
importance of availability and the

side-effects to avoid this uncomfortable

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,210
in dangerous situations design should

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,510
consider the ease of replacing

153
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,180
components in the design phase another

154
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,760
characteristic of EPS is that they

155
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,790
generally depend on extensive reporting

156
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,580
with Tory communication networks all the

157
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,310
strategy there are not specific to DBS

158
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,700
but are specifically relatively

159
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,040
discontent in this contest as the order

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,490
detect detection of potential dangers

attacks and produce a statistic that

164
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:07,850
Ralph will find some security that can

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:11,310
help identifying suspicious behavior

with regard to the soft subsequent

approach we should not inclusion of new

layers of agents in an EPS system with

169
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,530
will begin to play activity roles many

170
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,940
agents will begin to operate

171
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:30,090

assumed that this that some of them will

173
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,669
be really in ways that could harm all

174
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,848
ages or the entire system and it's

175
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,218
useful to identify them in society

176
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,490
social mechanism sites such as

paper which has as a concept trust is

187
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,079
the extent to which one party is willing

188
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,910
to depend on something or somebody in a

capacities and objectives will interact

197
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,780
due to the large number of variables

198
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:53,640
still the finance today it's debatable

199
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:56,220
an initial effort to develop an attempt

202
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,579
overall behavior of the system will

203
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,350
benefit benefit from research in this

decision-makers under normal conditions

219
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,939
there are several joint exercises in

under the coordination of cyber defence

225
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,750
commend the evolution of EPs in the

226
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,550
coming decades and their emergence some

227
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,070
security challenge discussed in this

228
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,560
paper we will need to be gradually

229
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:21,329
include early in this exercise in this

230
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,709
exercise effective EBS cyber security

231
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:28,738
should only a cover over government's

232
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:31,608

society they're all the digital

237
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:47,729
resilience of EBS which is the primary

238
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:49,379
objective of EPSRC huge should brotherly

239
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,649
be brought to the same level of

240
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:55,489
relevance as the security of EBS energy

241
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:59,220
supply of our electroporation stability

242
00:11:55,489 --> 00:12:01,859
if structures are also required for the

certification of a product product a

244
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:08,999
service of interest of two EPs including

245
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:13,019
concern about cyber risks caused but for

246
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:15,559
the gene such measures can help improve

247
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,929
the some security of human GPS

248
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:22,079
however they are insufficient to meet

249
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:24,259
all future needs the Sam security

250
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,478
governance of the new lives of

251
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,850
autonomous agents is a local core is an

252
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:33,109
open question that deserves special

253
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,059
attention next slide please

254
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:39,179
it can already be a challenge for EPS

255
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,909
companies to identify protector all of

256
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:44,339
their critical assets which can depend

257
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:47,220
on vast distance and complex global

258
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,889
supply chains however the problem is so

259
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,449
bound by the increased degree of digital

260
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:54,329
internet interconnect with other

261
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,978
companies because so soon about some

262
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,709
security can be as different as the

263
00:12:55,979 --> 00:13:02,069
companies want a sells for this scenario

264
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:05,099
it's recommended duties and diligence of

265
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:07,409
the connection points we offer with

266
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,829
other companies as well as the

267
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:12,689
definitive edition and application of

268
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:16,319
adequate adequate standards to be

269
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:19,319
followed about all parties and consider

270
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:23,099
that is some countries the poorest sales

271
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:26,099
division and merger of EPs companies are

272

routine a well planning sub security to

273
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,189
jealousy strategy would help to provide

274
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,560
an assessment process extend to do

275
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:37,649
delicious strategy to the newly

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,529
EBS agents is a chance that we likely

277
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,910
need to rely on the feeling would

278
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:48,810
specific connection patterns regarding

279
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,579
this story step one is a training IG and

280
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,550
IG it is important to highlight the

281

change their needs it's a very difficult

342
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:54,270
test thank you thank you thank you very

343
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:56,850
much thank you major campus thank you

344
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,520
for your presentation and thank you for

345
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,450
paving the ground for our upcoming

346
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,670
speaker

347
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,030
I would like to introduce our second

348
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,310
speaker Michael currently in the

349
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,790
governmental role has 20 years of

350
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,919
practical experience with IT and

351
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,810
industrial security he's one of the

352
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,090
leading experts in the realm of

353
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,520
industrial control system honeypot

354
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,099
deception technology it has been

355
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,770
credited for finding and responsibly

356
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:29,100
disclosing more than 15 previously

357
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:33,680
unknown zero-day vulnerabilities Michael

358
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,679
all the bytes and pixels are yours

359
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,610
excellent thank you very much for the

360
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,800
floor and thank you very much to the

361
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,929
previous present Cynthia for mentioning

362
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,389
honey pots it's always a favor to see

363
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:48,210
that because for various reason honey

364
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,430
pot is a very important layer of Defense

365
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,640
that has not always been utilized and

366
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,740
especially not with in industrialized

367
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,150
security and that's actually a shame I

368
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,700
would like to present this paper and it

369
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,580
has been

370
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,529
of all I would like to send thanks for

371
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,370
being allowed to do the presentation and

372
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:12,260
I would also like to send a special

373
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,479
gratification to my co Auditor

374
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,120
Michael substant who were actually been

375
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,169
like doing all the heavy lifting off of

376
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,739
this paper and I created some of the

377
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,200
data

378
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,110
big thanks to mr. Dobson and to his

379
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,220
professor mr. Pattinson both from

380
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,370
University of Cambridge next slide

381
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,370
please

382
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,899
just as mentioned in the introduction

383
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,940
for the last six years I've been working

384
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:43,279
with critical in a critical

385
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,789
infrastructure within especially like

386
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,730
power oil and gas and manufacturing as

387
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:52,399
mentioned Adam a lot of responsible

388
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,929
disclosure and it actually started six

389
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,850
years ago in the search for actually

390
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,909
finding reliable trade intelligence

391
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,658
regarding attacks on ICS and especially

392
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:07,760
on ICS who for whatever reason was faced

393
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:10,279
on the internet we think this president

394
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,158
this paper is very interesting during to

395
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,019
to the best of our knowledge it has the

396
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,740
largest data set and the longest period

397
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:22,309
ever yet been presented in Academical

398
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:27,440
paper if I could have to take slide

399
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:30,500
please yeah one of our key stones in

400
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,260
investigating was that given that we

401
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,409
would deploy hind section honeypot and a

402
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,389
honeypot is just a fake device and high

403
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,779
in section just base that it looks and

404
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:44,090
feels and act the way that a tiger would

405
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,010
expect basically it means that if you

406
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,519
are scanning like a Ethernet to serial

407
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:51,470
adapter like moxa it actually says yes I

408
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,419
am a mock Sam yes it replies back to the

409
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,730
right things but basically when we're

410
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:58,220
looking at profiles for external

411
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,750
attackers besides the vent and the

412
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,510
disgruntled employee

413
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,620
you basically have four groups of

414
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:09,350
attackers and the vertical skill line

415
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,879
here is like the people how technical

416
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,949
skills are they actually in order to

417
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,500
find and abuse ICS equipment

418
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,360
and just general how technical are there

419
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,210
on the horizon it's like what's the

420
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,350
motivation specific to hit our

421
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,730
organization because those two

422
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,669
parameters quite interesting especially

423
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,040
when you're looking into that so in the

424
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,600
lower left side you have the script

425
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,909
kiddies they don't have a lot of

426
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,850
technical knowledge and this don't

427
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:39,280
necessarily have a lot of motivation in

428
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:43,120
hitting our organization unfortunately

429
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,370
given the delicate state of industrial

430
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,479
control systems a script kiddie all even

431
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:52,209
worse just an automated computer virus

432
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,810
can do a lot of really unintended damage

433
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,590
and intercept crucial systems on the

434
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:01,120
right lower side we have the e crime

435
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,970
unfortunately crime due pace especially

436
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,560
on the internet they have a lot of

437
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,440
technical skills but perhaps not that

438
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,020
big kind of motivation to hit ICS

439
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,450
equipment actually they don't because

440
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,400
they're kind of funny things they don't

441
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,610
have a lot of CPUs you cannot mine a lot

442
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,590
of bitcoins on its so basics not that

443
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:24,209
then on the upper left side we have

444
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,830
anonymous or similar give you political

445
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,410
interest group that's not the same thing

446
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,449
as States but they might not have the

447
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,650
big technical thing but for various

448
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,360
reasons they might be feel very offended

449
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,900
for what your organization in example if

450
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,879
you like in an oil business and and

451
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,680
various other things then people might

452
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,290
be offended and want you to hit

453
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,160
organization and then last but not least

454
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:55,090
we have on the upper corner we have the

455
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,670
state-sponsored attackers apt at one

456
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,220
persistent rates groups and basically

457
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,830
they have a lot of technical skills and

458
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,040
a lot of motivation so basically we said

459
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,679
what is if we are going to deploy high

460
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,720
interaction honeypot on the network what

461
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,250
is sexy what kind of results are we

462
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,230
going to see which is what the papers

463
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,350
about if I could have the next slide

464
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,350
please

465
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,420
basically you would on the right side

466
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,760
you would see this as a normal way where

467
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,130
you would deploy a honeypot on a normal

468
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,890
layer of Defense you would have

469
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,809
delicious host scanning from outside the

470
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,049
threat you would have them to create

471
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:37,450
some of your equipment they would move

472
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:41,530
laterally and do different exploitation

473
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:44,200
within the enterprise network their IT

474
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,780
Network and then they would jump into a

475
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,970
firewall or similar safeguards and going

476
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,460
into the OT system and this is

477
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,690
definitely one of the places where

478
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,600
industrial control honeypot shines

479
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,900
because that an IOT network industrial

480
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,049
network traffic is very predictable it's

481
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,179
not certainly that hosts X Y Z H to task

482
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:07,210
to do scanning and doing a lot of

483
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,100
different things we had considered this

484
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,220
and in certain cases we actually have a

485
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,189
small set up of of a real equipment but

486
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,039
most of the honeypot was deployed in one

487
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:22,059
out of two ways one of them was this you

488
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:24,280
had a malicious host and then it was the

489
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:26,740
honey pots and on that Network it might

490
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,360
either have like real PC equipment it

491
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,240
might have the infamous

492
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,760
Mac's a converter of all other things so

493
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,710
basically that was various place of dual

494
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,280
deployment if I could have the next

495
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:43,470
slide please

496
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:48,129
oh I think you went one too I think you

497
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:52,090
know elect no no let's just go ahead

498
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,799
next I'm sorry basically when we are

499
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,899
talking about the honeypot just imagine

500
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,510
and that very often we hear the the

501
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,970
mentor that the agus just need to get

502
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,919
rid right once we need to have as a blue

503
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,500
team as a defender we need to be right

504
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,110
every every times but just imagine for

505
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,880
everyone who are to Ritchie attacking

506
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,408
when you're breaching a network very

507
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,390
often you wouldn't know anything about

508
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,880
it so the first thing you would normally

509
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,340
do is that you're going to exploit the

510
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,990
network you're going to make

511
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,580
reconnaissance and exit to find out

512
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,080
what's what's actually on that network

513
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,840
and when you're doing that you're making

514
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,699
a lot of noise so basically the whole

515
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,260
idea is that when you're making noise

516
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,110
when you start to interact with a

517
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,780
honeypot then we as a defender know that

518
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,908
this is somebody's attacking us and we

519
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,590
can respond accordingly so it's just

520
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,220
about you know changing the game and

521
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:45,250
changing the rule next slide please

522
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:48,190
yeah in most cases the way we deployed

523
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:53,830
the the network in totally we had more

524
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:56,650
than we had 120 census and that was when

525
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,500
when people were starting to scan then

526
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,110
basically the scan one or more IP

527
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,050
address and that was being rerouted or

528
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:10,830
proxied in technicals being into either

529
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:13,510
really high high very believable

530
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,760
simulations or even the real thing so

531
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,800
basically you could scan one IP address

532
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,720
in one country and then you would be

533
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,610
under the impression that you was

534
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,040
infecting with the real equipment you

535
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,439
was but however you could scan IP

536
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,649
address in example let's say Ukraine or

537
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,380
in the US and then find out that this IP

538
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,480
address is actually an unknowing - that

539
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,840
Sega was been rerouted into a data

540
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,430
center located in Scandinavia and that

541
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,320
would be the same thing as whenever

542
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,530
people was poking at IP addresses in

543
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,990
Russia and visa versa so basically that

544
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,370
was all being collected so it also gives

545
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:53,440
the look and the feel that it was

546
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:55,330
actually the real equipment and then in

547
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,450
certain cases we were having like this

548
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,090
built-in template so yeah if I could

549
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:04,660
have the next slide please

550
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:07,480
yeah so basically in in this case that

551
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,870
that would be the proxy this is very

552
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,200
most important because as mentioned that

553
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,850
on the honey part you have all within

554
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,560
the honeypot I'd say okay if you're

555
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,949
scanning for this phone in example if

556
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,440
you're scanning for port TCP 502 which

557
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,560
is the Modbus then I should reconnect

558
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,750
you into a real Modbus device and a

559
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,950
little quick word regarding the the

560
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,200
services or the protocols will be

561
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,410
choosing some of them is very vendor

562
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,780
specific but on purpose a lot of them

563
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,610
was not that vendor specific in example

564
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,500
like services like Modbus it's not

565
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,740
necessarily tied down to one specific

566
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:52,750
vendor we also from a technical project

567
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:54,540
effective was looking into IC 104 which

568
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,610
is within

569
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,980
electric grid and last but not least we

570
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,659
also in order to ensure that it was

571
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,670
believable put physicists a very

572
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,160
important part of the honeypot set up in

573
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:08,800
all we also make sure that certain

574
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,430
protocols like the T in p3 standard

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,960
which is only used in the US was to be

576
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:17,740
found in one of the honeypot who was

577
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,310
based in example in in Europe if I could

578
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,890
have the next slide please so basically

579
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,580
the thing about the the honeypot is that

580
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,470
first of all there would be no reason

581
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,520
whatsoever that people was trying to

582
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:36,460
attack our miss configurated ICS

583
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,129
equipments on the internet but besides

584
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,340
that and in normal circumstances in the

585
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,140
lair defense strategy then you would

586
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,169
normally say that any in section event

587
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,630
indicate either a his configuration like

588
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,610
something has changed like the base line

589
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,820
has changed that's not an attacker it's

590
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,649
just something else then a mistake

591
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,090
interesting pattern on some of them if

592
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,490
that would have been an in-house

593
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,639
honeypot I've done a lot of cases where

594
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,190
people actually by accident was hitting

595
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,200
the honeypot even they were little

596
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,150
people and then last but not least we

597
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,890
have the the attack the cool thing about

598
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,380
honeypot is as such you don't have any

599
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,990
false positive any alert and every event

600
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,330
should be investigated because that's

601
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,910
something that is animal it's something

602
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,370
like out of the ordinary if I could have

603
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,370
next slide please

604
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,770
yeah so a bit numbers on on the paper

605
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,070
the paper itself of course described

606
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:36,150
more in details but we had it located

607
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:39,639
geographical Sparrow out in 22 countries

608
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,340
around the world in order to avoid BS

609
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,440
because that just having a lot of funny

610
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,780
parts within an example like

611
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,640
Scandinavian Geographic wouldn't tell us

612
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,250
about what kind of stretch would there

613
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,070
be around for four other countries in

614
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,950
total we was using different devices we

615
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,340
were epidural used 50 different physical

616
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:04,360
devices and then above that also a

617
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:06,310
number of very believable simulation you

618
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,600
know also if you was interacting with

619
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,139
something it would rather be the real

620
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,790
device

621
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:15,490
oh it would be something that would be

622
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:17,320
simulating Vera Singh as one of the one

623
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,330
of the key things in in this papers are

624
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,129
also to the best of our knowledge it's

625
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,820
one of the largest data set that has

626
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,710
been used so far in a Academical paper

627
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,689
micro writer was very persistent give a

628
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:33,160
nasty meter provide a lot of data which

629
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:38,520
I applied to so we have 13 months of

630
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:42,160
data it was from March 2018 until April

631
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:46,300
2019 so it's also rather currently we

632
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:51,040
had more than 200,000 packets you know

633
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,320
flows and we had 887 interactions and

634
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,360
last but not least one thing there was

635
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,419
quite interesting that in one of our

636
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,250
high in section farms when it was real

637
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,520
equipment we actually managed to find

638
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,800
four zero days I'm not going to go too

639
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,540
much into details with those each of

640
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,120
them has been responsible disclosed to

641
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,649
the vendor each health in certain ways

642
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,659
acknowledge that this was a

643
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:17,350
vulnerability who was either not fixed

644
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:20,920
or either not known in advanced and most

645
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:25,000
of them was either denial of service a

646
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,730
gate us or buffer overflows so each of

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,300
them is currently in order to be fixed

648
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:33,510
in order to have a more secure world if

649
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,020
I could have the next slide please

650
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:41,050
yeah just a quick overview over some of

651
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,030
the the protocols as mentioned one thing

652
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,340
that is actually quite interesting is

653
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,070
that when we look through the data then

654
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:51,820
it doesn't come as a surprise that a lot

655
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,110
of them is you know automated tools or

656
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:58,210
known scannings

657
00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:00,459
tools so primary or almost in all cases

658
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,620
it was something that we could attribute

659
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,170
to knowns getting towards like okay this

660
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,560
is a map like okay this is this is

661
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,330
Metasploit module XY set and this is

662
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,129
actually also like the description is

663
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,750
very consistent with with previous

664
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,570
status that we also have been been

665
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,490
looking at but again the the most

666
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,070
interesting part is that when you filter

667
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:24,430
out all the known

668
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:27,129
access which is not by default evil

669
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,440
benign is like when we're filtering out

670
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,560
something like showed and read serve and

671
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,420
scan IO and all usual then you are

672
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,710
removing a lot of data set but you're

673
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,380
still into something that's that's

674
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,960
really really interesting because that

675
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,780
when you have removed 95 or 99 percent

676
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,520
of the data of course what's left is is

677
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,560
this thing who is actually quite

678
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,510
interesting if I could have the next

679
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:53,020
slide please

680
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,800
yeah and not only that but also as a

681
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,080
compliment

682
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,879
a university of was so kind so they

683
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,550
actually had an additional data set

684
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,280
which my co-author mr. Dobson was

685
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:09,159
getting access to and the interesting

686
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,230
part about that is that some of the IP

687
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,430
addresses who were specific training for

688
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:18,010
Isis equipments was also something who

689
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,410
specifically was scanning for Mirai and

690
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,090
other IO cheese things and that again

691
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,540
shows unfortunately there's some kind of

692
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:31,000
convenient between Isis and IOT last

693
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,680
slide please yeah so just to sum up you

694
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,960
can use honey pots to in the try and

695
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,370
profile new target at sex it goes

696
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,710
without saying if somebody was going

697
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,080
specific for you organizations it would

698
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,870
not be showed para games show some value

699
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,370
Isis Nyota domains are converting some

700
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,060
of the people is looking for one is

701
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:51,729
looking for the Euler and again it was

702
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:55,000
globally distributed so that also gave

703
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,350
us a better thing of the things with

704
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,560
that I would like to say thank you very

705
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:05,110
much for your attention thank you thank

706
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,990
you Michael so much for the presentation

707
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,560
and your marvelous work being done on

708
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,600
the industrial control system honey pots

709
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,629
with this I would like to introduce our

710
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,060
distinguished expert Patrick Miller has

711
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,070
dedicated his career to the protection

712
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,740
and defense of critical infrastructures

713
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,200
as a trusted independent security and

714
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,690
regulatory adviser he's a managing

715
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,400
partner and Archer international as well

716
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,940
as the founder director and president

717
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,720
emeritus of Energy SEC and United States

718
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,630
coordinator

719
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,309
or the industrial cybersecurity center

720
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:43,240
Patrick's diverse background spans the

721
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:47,220
energy water delegations and financial

722
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,360
services Patrick the cyberspace is yours

723
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,230
awesome thank you and great

724
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,580
presentations from the folks before me

725
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,730
what some I'm just going to give a brief

726
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,408
piece on what I'm seeing for kind of now

727
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,940
in the future for industrial control

728
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:03,309
systems

729
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,679
Michael good job on describing some of

730
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:08,560
the adversaries I like to summarize this

731
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,389
as basically our adversaries have three

732
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,799
things that we don't they have to have

733
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,770
people they have money and they have

734
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,500
time most organizations and most

735
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,359
governments don't get all three I think

736
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,639
an important distinction is that not all

737
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,469
of the adversaries are nation-states or

738
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,149
terrorist groups you know remember there

739
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:28,388
are things out there like organized

740
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:31,449
crime and even your competitors as well

741
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:34,750
and from an industrial perspective the

742
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,609
the I guess the sophistication is really

743
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,960
one of the keys some of them are far

744
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:41,080
more sophisticated than others

745
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,240
of course but the fact is a lot of them

746
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,399
don't have to be we're still finding

747
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,319
control systems on showdown on a daily

748
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,089
basis and they're not always Michaels

749
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,440
honey pots there are actually real

750
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,349
systems that we're still finding on

751
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,440
showdown all the time you know the world

752
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:58,950
is at least for the industrial side it's

753
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,210
made up of a lot of embedded systems

754
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,009
these embedded systems they're

755
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,390
purpose-built they basically do one

756
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,400
thing and they do that one thing very

757
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,470
well they can be environmentally

758
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,630
hardened for example top rate in extreme

759
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,549
conditions but that's it they're not

760
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,349
like the IT world of course they're not

761
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,940
you know Windows and UNIX all the time

762
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:18,609
the interface is to them like your

763
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,099
human-machine interfaces are but that

764
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:23,170
that kind of that industrial side of the

765
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,609
the sensors and the activators and all

766
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,010
of these components that run our world

767
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:29,440
behind it it's all basically these these

768
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,300
purpose-built devices they're all going

769
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,980
digital that's one of our bigger

770
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,330
challenges is this stuff used to be

771
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,820
everything from analog to

772
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,830
electromechanical they were physics

773
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,570
based in a lot of cases with you know

774
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,190
very lightweight digital components

775
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:46,210
moving forward that's going to be

776
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:48,490
heavily digital not because well I guess

777
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,880
primarily because the digital stuff acts

778
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,350
is more it's smarter it can do things

779
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,230
better but it can also be manipulated

780
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:58,450
like any other digital device I think

781
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,920
the challenge I think with the the

782
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,629
digitization of everything is the

783
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,850
everything gets embedded so I mean I

784
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,200
know a lot of programmers they're very

785
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,610
smart they're very brilliant but they

786
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,770
also don't want to write new codes so

787
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,510
they'll reuse old code and that gets

788
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,130
embedded inside something else that's

789
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,869
embedded inside something else that's

790
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,000
embedded too are we really at this point

791
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,730
in our digital state we've kind of lost

792
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,650
track of all of the kind of historical

793
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,420
pieces that just creates more landscape

794
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,790
for all of the attackers all the way

795
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,390
down into things like compilers and you

796
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,310
know very esoteric options so that

797
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,009
embedded thing really is is one of our

798
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:37,840
key issues in terms of one of our risk

799
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,369
components additionally all of these

800
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,200
things as they get smarter we're

801
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,360
connecting them all to each other before

802
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,279
we didn't do that right there were most

803
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,100
of these things were effectively

804
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,720
isolated I hate to use the word air-gap

805
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,779
they were more or less isolated into

806
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,299
discreet areas in the future all of this

807
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,480
will be connected to everything else

808
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,490
it's gonna be hyper connected in ways

809
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,080
that the perimeter will still be there

810
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,939
but it will matter less and there will

811
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,500
be very complex relationships with other

812
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,950
perimeters and perimeters that you don't

813
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,570
control in a lot of cases that that's

814
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,730
that's just part of our future and

815
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:15,580
that's being driven by business because

816
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,080
the data from these systems is very very

817
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,319
important and I'll talk about that in a

818
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,140
minute the the other component is that

819
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,369
this technology used to be like frankly

820
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,750
some of these things are huge like in

821
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,420
our tea you used to be this size of a

822
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,790
refrigerator now they're smaller and

823
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,380
smaller and it's really just going away

824
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,850
that the technology is getting small

825
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,570
enough to just be the part of the fabric

826
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:41,529
of the factory or the facility the IOT

827
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:44,080
and IOT components are being built into

828
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,609
the actual physical components that we

829
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,040
you know used to not have any kind of

830
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,600
technology in them at all so it's just

831
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,009
kind of going away from our site that

832
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,770
makes it harder to control and harder to

833
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,390
manage when you can't see it and all of

834
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,850
this has to live within an ecosystem

835
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,740
that is basically you know legacy some

836
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,839
of this stuff is 20 30 50 years old so

837
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,609
they have to live side by side

838
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,710
this innovation that we're facing is

839
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,999
something you really can't stop there's

840
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,519
a lot of folks are trying to slow this

841
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,868
down humans are going to innovate and

842
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,160
they're probably gonna do it faster than

843
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,589
we want and they're gonna do things that

844
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,230
are gonna disrupt us those of us in the

845
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:17,980
industrial space are gonna have to get

846
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,680
uncomfortably comfortable with

847
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,150
innovation because it's it's what's

848
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,038
happening and we have to basically

849
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,499
embrace it and try to teach it good

850
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:29,680
manners as early as we can because in

851
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:32,279
reality the data is the future we're

852
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,230
using data in unique and creative ways

853
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:38,079
basically in ways we never had before

854
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,420
and just kind of open your mind a bit to

855
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,369
this where in the future we're likely

856
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,890
going to see things everything from yes

857
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,630
cloud yes virtualization yes

858
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,739
AI and machine learning all of these

859
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,869
things are going to find their way into

860
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,999
our world they're gonna be used in ways

861
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:55,720
because they're they're profitable data

862
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:57,759
is worth money data may be worth money

863
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,140
in ways that it's actually may be worth

864
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:00,849
more than your product at some point in

865
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,279
the future we may see a time when people

866
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:05,259
give away electricity or other

867
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,749
industrial components to make money off

868
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:09,160
of the data about that that that's

869
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:11,529
interesting and it's gonna change things

870
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,009
so what can we do to make this situation

871
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:16,119
better there's the immediate reaction is

872
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:18,369
regulation and I'm a recovering

873
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,249
regulator I've been on that side I've

874
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,779
seen regulation all around the globe

875
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:25,689
over-regulation can really hurt the

876
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:28,119
innovation and expansion of great ideas

877
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:31,059
and can basically hamper industry

878
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,059
believe it or not it creates an

879
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:35,710
artificial ceiling where you say once if

880
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:37,509
I meet the regulation then therefore I'm

881
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,940
secure which is actually not true in any

882
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:41,499
way regulation you know compliance and

883
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,450
security are two different things you

884
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:46,058
shouldn't fear the auditor more than you

885
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,129
fear the attacker right so that's where

886
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:50,349
we need to change the mindset of making

887
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,880
this a good business decision because

888
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,009
it's basically good for your business

889
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,269
you know reliability and uptime is good

890
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:57,609
for you and security enables that

891
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:59,890
security also enables safety in our

892
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:01,720
world without security you don't really

893
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,430
have safety or reliability of your

894
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,390
operation so thinking about it

895
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,609
differently from a regulation

896
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,960
perspective light touches market forces

897
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:09,308
those kinds of things can really help

898
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,720
what you're trying to do is not

899
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,359
prescribe just action but trying to

900
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,319
motivate attitude with regulation be

901
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,090
careful there

902
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,070
one of the last pieces is supply chain

903
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,710
everyone likes to really run to supply

904
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:23,560
chain we're seeing like a frankly a

905
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,840
balkanization of everything really

906
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,340
understand made in a country really just

907
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,280
means assembled in that country we don't

908
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,230
have a situation where any country can

909
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,760
make everything literally on their own

910
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,590
soil from start to finish it just

911
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,060
doesn't exist anymore

912
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,800
so let's look at things like global

913
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,180
transparency initiatives and how do we

914
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,490
get something where we can still operate

915
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,160
in ways because the market drove us to

916
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,660
this point where we are now let's use

917
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,950
that to our advantage and find ways to

918
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,690
actually work together with some

919
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,460
transparency options so we can continue

920
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,220
down this path without isolating each

921
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,850
other and making the problem worse the

922
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:00,640
key issue is dependency we are dependent

923
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,319
on our industries they make all of the

924
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,170
things that we use they run our water

925
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,630
our lights our oil everything about our

926
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,550
transportation systems all of this

927
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,590
industrial stuff we're heavily dependent

928
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,550
on it is also heavenly to heavily

929
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:17,110
dependent on technology this it isn't

930
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,280
like iPhones and TVs where you change it

931
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,890
all out all the time but it does change

932
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,900
I think the interesting part is we've

933
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,819
got to get back to understanding the

934
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,310
gravity of making changes in these

935
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,930
environments at that speed it's gonna go

936
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,190
faster it's gonna be uncomfortable but

937
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,419
that still got to be balanced and

938
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:36,250
measured that that approach has to

939
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,870
embrace what we really wouldn't consider

940
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,150
just all this preventive measures you

941
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,190
still have to do prevention but it's

942
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,110
more about resilience so you are likely

943
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,640
going to see some sort of attack you

944
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,720
know if you're not already you know if

945
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,629
they haven't already hacked and you just

946
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,310
don't know about it that basically means

947
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,870
focus more on resilience than security

948
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,430
how do you operate through an attack how

949
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,920
do you operate through ransomware on

950
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,230
your plant floor what can you do do you

951
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,650
know enough about your system to operate

952
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,810
manually have you tried this doesn't the

953
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,480
sudden just happen by luck or chance or

954
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,980
hope this requires the system to be

955
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,950
designed for that and it's got to have

956
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,480
prepared people for it so practice and

957
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,189
you don't necessarily need a million new

958
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,660
security widgets you can actually use

959
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,940
what you have if you know how to use it

960
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,279
well humans are very creative in those

961
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,200
situations and having practice with the

962
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,600
tools that they have can be very

963
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,790
beneficial so they'll end on the note of

964
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,040
focusing on resilience

965
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,020
and security to enable things like you

966
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,070
know frankly business optimization and

967
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:38,650
reliability and safety back to you

968
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:42,120
Bernard thank you thank you thank you

969
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:45,910
vetrix so much for forward-looking

970
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,040
introduction into what would expect into

971
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,350
the upcoming future actually you as you

972
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,170
already clearly stated we don't have to

973
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:55,900
wait until the future starts in an

974
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:59,200
unknown time ahead it's already here and

975
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,330
we already ramping up and really rushing

976
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,689
towards the future and bringing all the

977
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:07,810
technology that we have with us into the

978
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:11,200
future and building on top of it I would

979
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:13,900
like to start with the first question I

980
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,589
have but I will address it to major

981
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,380
Campos yes we and it's more of course

982
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:23,440
going to be addressed to the rest of the

983
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:27,370
panelists as well initially two major

984
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,010
campus so your papers is focusing on

985
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:32,339
electrical power grids and I fully agree

986
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,700
we are dependent on electrical power

987
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,950
everything is kind of dependent on it

988
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,810
but our are we ready our our

989
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,810
infrastructure is resilient enough to

990
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:46,270
withstand the attacks and external

991
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,070
offensive cyber operations are we are we

992
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:52,470
there yet what are the steps that we

993
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:55,030
need to take and as decarbonisation

994
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,819
digitalization and decentralization that

995
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,610
your paper talks about a viable solution

996
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:06,580
for securing the future of the energy

997
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:08,920
sector major Campos yeah this scenario

998
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:12,700
will be a trend and we bring great

999
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:16,030
benefits to society but we must look at

1000
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:19,240
the challenges to be facing if you bring

1001
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:21,970
into is true the reality of his might be

1002
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,580
for example where the layers approach

1003
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,490
allows the actor to interact with the

1004
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:30,490
system the attack surface will grow

1005
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:33,580
exponentially in just the most friendly

1006
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,640
part with little maturity cyber security

1007
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:39,369
will be more such that trusted

1008
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,339
susceptible to this type approach

1009
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:45,519
we do not expect many chains in the

1010
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:48,549
first lay of Ages that these theories

1011
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,008
operators larget customers but other

1012
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:53,799
layers with fear are most relevant today

1013
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:56,109
from the sub security point of view will

1014
00:44:53,799 --> 00:45:00,130
gradually become critical for the proper

1015
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:03,220
rating operation of the system millions

1016
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,619
of new agents as more agents we will

1017
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,959
start to operate actively in the

1018
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:10,960
electric power system each one in search

1019
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,349
with its own interests and with no

1020
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,619
regard to general system the environment

1021
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:20,920
on which those ages will operate tends

1022
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:23,619
to be much less less secure then they

1023
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,009
Scott a scale environment and these

1024
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:29,940
agents will potentially be in contact

1025
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:33,249
with huge numbers of odd agents a

1026
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:36,279
summary we can speck in the link expect

1027
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:39,730
an increase in these risks related to

1028
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:43,509
the first layer but but the range of

1029
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:47,109
motivation will not change much except

1030
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:51,670
if the new business models for example

1031
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:56,140
for a fax appear all right thank you

1032
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:58,869
Thank You Patrick do you have your

1033
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,210
viewpoint on the decarbonization

1034
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:04,779
digitalization and decentralization are

1035
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:09,519
these potential solutions for ensuring

1036
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:12,039
our resiliency yeah yeah I think we can

1037
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,808
we can do this there's a lot of

1038
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,559
technologies out there that do a very

1039
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:19,690
good job I think the hard part is just

1040
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,069
knowing what you have and knowing how to

1041
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,420
protect it

1042
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:25,359
none of these things that we're

1043
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,200
introducing are frankly really new I

1044
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,640
mean none of this stuff is like

1045
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,239
something we've never thought of before

1046
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:34,210
or is you know alien in nature it's just

1047
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:36,700
more of it so how we deal with it is

1048
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,890
more of a scaling problem than it is a

1049
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:42,640
new issue with an unaddressed Bowl

1050
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:44,859
solution so I think done well yes this

1051
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,200
can be can be done it's more how do you

1052
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:48,609
scale to the level of where every single

1053
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,720
thing in your environment creates a data

1054
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,410
stream and has a connection to

1055
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,390
everything else so that that brick

1056
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,850
your your capabilities to respond and

1057
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,920
scale accordingly and could you do

1058
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:02,220
things like break sections of it off to

1059
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,680
protect or isolate threats so all those

1060
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,270
things you would typically do on a small

1061
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,890
scale do you just got to do that on a

1062
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:10,380
much much larger scale in a much more

1063
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:13,819
complex environment but yes it can be

1064
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:19,110
done right thank you

1065
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:21,330
now Michael your your work that you

1066
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:26,370
contributed as a cool author and data

1067
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:30,049
set came from your honey met now what

1068
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:32,970
was the the approach that you took when

1069
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:35,460
analyzing and processing the data or

1070
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,299
maybe not directly you but the other

1071
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,010
authors of the paper

1072
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,270
could you please a little bit elaborate

1073
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,550
than this yeah sure because that

1074
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:49,230
everyone and a lot of security windows

1075
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,510
likes to say that they have X million

1076
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,270
trillions of an attack heat in every day

1077
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:55,560
so basically we took the data set and

1078
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,890
look into it okay

1079
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,140
based on the list that built our

1080
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:04,220
organization maintained on known

1081
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:08,700
scanners a.k like showed an I was in

1082
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:12,240
whatever your opinion occurs those kind

1083
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,970
of services organization there they

1084
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,700
actually not they're not truly evil they

1085
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:20,100
are not evil they're just exposing what

1086
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,990
people have chosen either knowing or

1087
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,000
unknown ly on the Internet

1088
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,160
so first of all we took that date and

1089
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,570
left that because we said well sure and

1090
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:33,420
might be scanning they might using known

1091
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:35,130
IOT commands like using mark person

1092
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,370
order to say hello Marcus what kind of

1093
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:40,650
device you so we took that out and then

1094
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:43,380
when we have read that out then of

1095
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,460
course the the remaining days there was

1096
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,610
when it was starting to get really

1097
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,950
interesting because very often IP

1098
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,940
address fully automated scanning for

1099
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:58,710
something all right

1100
00:48:50,940 --> 00:49:01,170
then it went away intervene Mike so just

1101
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:03,650
from my perspective the attackers will

1102
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:06,240
anyway use the showdown or any other

1103
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:09,420
system that can automatically scan

1104
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,600
and in your your talk you said that you

1105
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,250
would rather take those data sets or the

1106
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,680
streams out of the data set

1107
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:19,290
wouldn't that already kind of minimize

1108
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,830
the the actual scope and the visibility

1109
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:24,660
of the actual malicious attacks yeah but

1110
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:28,200
that's the keyword that's unn malicious

1111
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,029
because in our view show Dennis itself

1112
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,000
is not malicious they're not trying to

1113
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:35,850
exploit that I used ICS equipment we're

1114
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,710
putting up they want to interrogate them

1115
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:39,270
they want to query them but in in in

1116
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:43,170
essence they don't want to do something

1117
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:44,880
evil by themselves but then with the

1118
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,740
smaller subset it was just suddenly

1119
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,320
possible to do more even more

1120
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,020
interesting analyze like in example you

1121
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:55,500
could see certain IP address in an

1122
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,570
example yet Nam was always scanning what

1123
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,080
well seems to be a building management

1124
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:03,690
system in Russia but that specific IP

1125
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,900
address never ever ever scanned the

1126
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:10,080
similar system in the US or in UK or the

1127
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:14,250
one who was based in South America so so

1128
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,710
that was some sourcing right that's that

1129
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,720
is absolutely good explanation for this

1130
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,340
the question that I would would like to

1131
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,910
direct to you and then afterwards does

1132
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:26,940
the rest of the panel is now your work

1133
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:30,060
and your entire career is about

1134
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,630
disclosing and uncovering the zero days

1135
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:36,119
now is there a need to change the

1136
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:39,090
disclosure policies or processes that we

1137
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,760
currently use for ICS related

1138
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:46,020
vulnerabilities in a sense zero days

1139
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,730
such as like Google's 90 day full

1140
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,350
disclosure policy would this be

1141
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:53,970
applicable to industrial cultural

1142
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:55,859
systems well III can say yes we need to

1143
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,410
change it but going the Google way is

1144
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:00,930
definition not the correct way to to do

1145
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,629
it during my career when I have done

1146
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,730
responsible disclosure to a lot of about

1147
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,790
very small well-known vendors and and

1148
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:11,100
smaller and thus the 90 days would no

1149
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,270
way give them any fair change in order

1150
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,130
to fix it

1151
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,920
of course you come down to manage the

1152
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,480
maturity of the vendor itself but very

1153
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,650
often the need to come up with a

1154
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,960
solution

1155
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,120
perhaps there might be other things to

1156
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,610
consider and last but not least very

1157
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:29,130
importance they also need to ensure that

1158
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,470
whatever update they're doing in order

1159
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,840
to fix whatever one ability I have found

1160
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,149
don't break other stuff or other

1161
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,940
services in their product and that's a

1162
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:40,350
time consuming thing I have been and and

1163
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,390
I know either here in the panel as well

1164
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,880
have been working together within this

1165
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:48,000
like two or three years in order to get

1166
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,040
this fixed and it's not necessarily not

1167
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,230
necessarily a sign that the vendor don't

1168
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,480
want to cooperate it's just a very very

1169
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,950
complex thing because you don't want to

1170
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,470
make mistakes when you're rolling out a

1171
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:03,569
new firmware or updates in that kind so

1172
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:06,930
definitely absolutely yes I agree this

1173
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:10,500
is a very very sensitive

1174
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:14,160
thank you run the updates and the

1175
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,900
industrial control systems Patrick would

1176
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,430
you like to take a stab at this as well

1177
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,300
do you see from the high-level

1178
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:27,359
perspective of the changes in the

1179
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:28,620
disclosure policy yeah I'm I'm

1180
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,180
struggling with how to make it any

1181
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,830
better than it already is

1182
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,160
I don't know if there's an easy solution

1183
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:36,540
to this you're always going to have

1184
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,089
organizations that find them hoard them

1185
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,040
and sell them put them on the dark web

1186
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,390
the organization's whether they're

1187
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,150
nation state organizations or

1188
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:47,629
non-government organizations organized

1189
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,850
crime and just independent researchers

1190
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:53,160
there is a healthy market for this on

1191
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:56,069
both the legitimate market and the

1192
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,140
illegitimate market given the fact that

1193
00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:00,240
there is a market for it before it will

1194
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,089
operate basically with the rules of

1195
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,520
economics we can try to change those

1196
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:09,540
rules with various regulations and good

1197
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:12,290
practice but in fact it's gonna likely

1198
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,880
follow standard economic bad behaviors

1199
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,130
so unfortunately there isn't an easy

1200
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,190
answer or a good answer for this we're

1201
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:23,160
doing in a lot of cases not a great job

1202
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,870
but I would argue maybe an okay job it's

1203
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,750
it could be it could be worse we'll put

1204
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:30,000
it that way but there's I think as

1205
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,070
Michael put it the vendors if I could

1206
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,480
make a plea to the vendors have a front

1207
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:36,000
door for people to come in

1208
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,410
with vulnerabilities and you know

1209
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,330
dedicate some focus to this you're

1210
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,129
basically getting you know out sourced

1211
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,779
vulnerability research on your products

1212
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,720
to make your products better safer more

1213
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,940
reliable this makes your gives you a

1214
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,189
market differentiator as being better

1215
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,590
than your competitors that don't so

1216
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,540
consider the economic benefits of having

1217
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,070
a more secure platform and having a

1218
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,290
front door and a response team for

1219
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,930
dealing with these things so it's

1220
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:03,330
there's a lot of complex moving parts in

1221
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,549
this and there isn't an easy answer but

1222
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,259
yes we should endeavor to get better at

1223
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,850
this unfortunately it's not going to be

1224
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,280
a light switch that here's your perfect

1225
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:15,060
solution it's gonna be rocky and strange

1226
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,010
going forward right right absolutely I

1227
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,590
agree with you on this one

1228
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:22,470
taking into account your international

1229
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:24,750
and global experience Patrick do you say

1230
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,339
that there are have you observed any key

1231
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,790
differences between the regional

1232
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:33,000
approaches such as the United States

1233
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:35,220
European Union Asia when actually they

1234
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,869
are trying to address the same very same

1235
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,839
in the other control system related

1236
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:42,060
security concerns is there a difference

1237
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,950
and how can you learn together and is

1238
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,279
that an option can we share information

1239
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,930
together is that an option

1240
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,359
yeah yeah of course there are

1241
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,080
differences regionally you know most

1242
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:59,310
fears even you know quarter hemispheres

1243
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:00,869
there's this is this is a tough one as

1244
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,090
well to answer because it's what we're

1245
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:04,770
finding is is closing the door and not

1246
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:06,869
communicating is certainly not helping

1247
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,160
we're all using the same technologies

1248
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:10,560
and they're all made by the same vendors

1249
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,330
and the manuals come in every language

1250
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,090
and then there's Google Translate if you

1251
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,980
don't have your language there so we

1252
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,950
have to just admit the fact that we're

1253
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,200
now a global ecosystem of technology at

1254
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,990
this point packets don't have boundaries

1255
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,549
in in most cases even currency doesn't

1256
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,879
have boundaries anymore with the advent

1257
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:31,740
of the digital currency so we need to

1258
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,830
just admit the fact that it's one big

1259
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,319
happy planet at this point that said I

1260
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,119
would definitely endeavor to get things

1261
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,640
like global transparency initiatives and

1262
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,950
more open communication versus the

1263
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,720
opposite and nations that isolate

1264
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:48,069
themselves may feel better about that

1265
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,330
because now they're not there you know

1266
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:52,300
in theory they're eliminating threats

1267
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:54,940
from the outside but again unless you

1268
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,520
can literally make everything inside

1269
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,170
your boundaries that you need for

1270
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,450
everything else that's which is a

1271
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,680
challenge even then what you're doing is

1272
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,540
you're you're now closing your eyes to

1273
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:08,410
all of the other innovation and bright

1274
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:10,090
ideas fantastic security approaches and

1275
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,290
defensive maneuvers and even offensive

1276
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:16,380
maneuvers that are happening out there

1277
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:19,230
in the world it is it's close it's quite

1278
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,430
right and I would I would assume that

1279
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,800
running the exercises and training

1280
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,799
together either in the nation or

1281
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,690
multi-nation could be the one way to

1282
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,420
increase the critical infrastructure

1283
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,590
resilience not only the critical

1284
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,280
infrastructure but the nation's

1285
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:39,849
preparedness major composts your work

1286
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,609
also in the paper and your primary work

1287
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:44,980
is also related to running the exercises

1288
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:47,830
do you see that these exercises do

1289
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,810
provide the benefit for resiliency

1290
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:55,750
threat response and governments and and

1291
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:59,220
in what way yeah yeah yeah it's a good

1292
00:56:55,750 --> 00:57:01,810
approach it's I think it's necessary

1293
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,029
the exercise need to represent a key

1294
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:07,930
element of the electricity sector and

1295
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:12,310
other sectors in a realist way in Brazil

1296
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:15,399
we'll have we we have our cyber guardo

1297
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:17,890
since it's 2017 with a

1298
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,430
telecommunications sector for network

1299
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:25,060
nuclear sector telecommunication sector

1300
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:27,069
water sector and others this is

1301
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,960
structural change in the sector in

1302
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:32,109
particular the participation of

1303
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,359
countless new agents will have to be

1304
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:38,140
represented in some way for the results

1305
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:40,180
of the exercise to be valid in this case

1306
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:42,759
how land coordinated actions are

1307
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,230
essential components of the defensive

1308
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,960
strategy against some tons of

1309
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,950
cyberattacks we the director at EPS

1310
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,470
all-embracing

1311
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:53,290
or the quad core infrastructure and then

1312
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,930
in turn agents join combining the

1313
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:58,359
exercise should be centrally coordinated

1314
00:57:54,930 --> 00:58:00,669
and involve different public and private

1315
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:04,330
back partner

1316
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:06,490
how how it's happened in Brazil include

1317
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:09,730
included those these sectors of the

1318
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:13,029
Armed Forces and government responsible

1319
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:15,210
for the sovereigns did the engagement of

1320
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,390
different sector of society assists

1321
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:21,070
Imperial robosub security community

1322
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:24,430
capable change experienced in good

1323
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:26,830
practices and established protocols for

1324
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:29,440
information safe share and cooperative

1325
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,600
work this may prove essential in crisis

1326
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,910
situation otherwise if they change

1327
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:37,509
exchange of base information can be

1328
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:39,339
difficult the evolution of EPS of the

1329
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:42,280
next decade in their imagined sub

1330
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,560
security challenge discussed in our

1331
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,630
session for example we need to be

1332
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,210
gradually included in those exercise

1333
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,620
they will have an impact impact of the

1334
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:53,220
assimilation of scenarios in

1335
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:56,350
cyberattacks improvement in bringing new

1336
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:59,740
vulnerabilities to be reproduces crisis

1337
00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:02,799
management incidence response and action

1338
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:09,819
place must involve coordinating input a

1339
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:11,760
say for example the exercise ok major

1340
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:15,640
campus thank you thank you for the point

1341
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,400
we have time only for the last question

1342
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:21,040
which I would like to ask for the rest

1343
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,280
of the panel is for the all of you on

1344
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:27,040
the panel is if we're looking very far

1345
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,650
into the future well relatively very far

1346
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,259
in the future what would be the sector

1347
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:37,870
that you would say is going to be the

1348
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:40,510
next target that you would foresee as as

1349
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:43,210
a target for offensive operations or as

1350
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:46,510
a target for any operations whether it

1351
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:50,920
be anything so I will start with Patrick

1352
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:55,060
please electricity electricity yeah

1353
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,620
thank you yeah the hub around which all

1354
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,720
other infrastructures revolve without

1355
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,279
power things go down real fast so I

1356
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,520
would say electricity and comms because

1357
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:05,380
they're they're woven together exactly

1358
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,060
and you already said that there is

1359
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,190
everything of hyper-connectivity

1360
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,790
that we might anticipate in the in the

1361
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,990
future Michael your take on this

1362
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:15,580
yeah in a good panel you

1363
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:17,259
shouldn't agree with everything every

1364
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,990
other size because otherwise I said

1365
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:22,390
exactly the same thing as Patrick but I

1366
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,430
would actually say power but also water

1367
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:27,730
because water is actually in some cases

1368
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:31,000
very Elementary built for healthcare and

1369
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:33,820
actually producing water and water

1370
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,650
sewage like water purification and

1371
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:39,220
cleaning facilities as well would that

1372
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:41,350
be is it yeah that's sorry that's when I

1373
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,490
said water that put also especially mean

1374
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:47,500
like is you're rich in other things yes

1375
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:49,750
clear thank you so much major campus I

1376
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,050
know your work focuses on energy sector

1377
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:57,369
is there any other your favorite

1378
01:00:52,050 --> 01:01:00,940
secretary besides energy in my opinion I

1379
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:05,500
think the combination of let with energy

1380
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:11,280
and telecommunications anything because

1381
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:13,840
their interdependencies infrastructure

1382
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:18,119
thank you thank you so much thank you

1383
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:22,090
our panelists experts honored guests

1384
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:25,240

1385
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:29,020
session now we understand that the

1386
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:32,850
future is going harder it's going to be

1387
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:38,080
more in three Quine and we already there

1388

1392
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,760
first session of our tech day and also a

1393
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:02,080
huge thank you to you the audience

1394
