welcome back ladies and gentlemen and

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,430
let's proceed with the second session of

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,220
the legal day I am very happy to

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,740
introduce our next moderator our very

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,340
own katryca Scott who is the head of the

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,960
law branch at the CCD native CCDC OE

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,570
please cut rip the floor is yours

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,910
thanks a much leaner and hello and

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,550
welcome to the second session of the law

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,429
day of the saikhan 2020 book launch and

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,010
I know I'm not by any means original in

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,930
saying this but I do regret not to be

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,910
able to have you in talent today it's a

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,040
lovely cycle whether somebody turned the

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,160
temperature on Justin for the right time

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,379
and here we are the ways this has been

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,209
an extraordinary spring are diverse and

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,340
plentiful and the cybersecurity

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,890
community not not least has been one

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,110
that has experienced a surge in both the

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,409
amount and the criticality of our work

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,150
while working like everybody else to

24
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,509
keep our families and colleagues safe

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,490
and sane but it looks like the new

26
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,799
quality and new value is always bought

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,060
out of the born out of the pain of

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,890
crisis so not only am i thrilled about

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,380
the excellent content our speakers are

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,380
about to present to you and grateful

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,548
indeed for their flexibility and their

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,548
commitment to be part of this rather

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,520
different cycle I'm also curious to be

34
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,499
redefining cycle and the cybersecurity

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,530
conferencing perhaps together with such

36
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:44,389
bright minds and the excellent team here

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,520
in Tulane

38
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:51,060
so in order of appearance a warm welcome

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:59,189
mr. Levin knows Mecca mr. Neal coos raha

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:03,270
and dr. Tina Park thank you hey and

41
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,630
before we begin some house rules I will

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,519
begin by introducing our speakers in

43
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,799
order of appearance and they will then

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,340
each have 12 minutes to present their

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,610
papers with perhaps a follow on question

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,519
from me and then we will proceed to a

47
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,030
joint Q&A session after the after the

48
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,270
presentations and to the viewers you can

49
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,800
see a chat button

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,390
the bottom right of your screen have you

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
brought the screen so please don't be

52
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,880
shy using it and sending your questions

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,490
to the speakers will be happy to dive

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,000
into into discussions at the second half

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:44,080
of the question we welcome all of us to

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,720
make this interactive so our first

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,190
speaker is mr. Levine Anika

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,930
who will speak about some of the legal

59
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,030
challenges around cyber threat

60
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,860
information sharing by the private

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,230
sector

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,270
Mustaine Vega is a PhD candidate at the

63
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,130
department of information security and

64

Roma in Italy when he has worked with a

70
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,730
next-generation firewall team in cisco

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,930
in poland and his research concerns

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,570
amongst other themes critical

73
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,670
infrastructure protection and

74
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:28,049
software-defined networking so mr.

75
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,049
Becker the floor is yours

76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:50,459
my name is in communication technology

77
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:55,840
and innovation technology you know in

78
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:58,540
presenting my research article I thought

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,790
release is related to cyber threat

80
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,340
information sharing for critical

81
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:11,649
infrastructure protection you just open

82
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:14,260
by steaming and also if you can switch

83
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,570
least like readiness that we thank you

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,730
the airline of the presentation is as

85
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,659
follows

86
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:26,740
I will give a brief notion we had

87
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:32,350
described the motivation for the article

88
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:34,810
and main focus the basic health or cyber

89
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,729
trade information sharing including the

90
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,320
existence information sharing

91
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,180
architectures

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:47,159
benefits and challenges we presented

93
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:50,950
then out of those regulations in the EU

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:55,920
Norway and the u.s. that are related to

95
00:04:50,950 --> 00:05:00,000
a betray dimension cherry the outcome of

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,190
the existing rules and regulations and

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,710
the currency transaction among

98
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,840
practitioners hasn't released I'm

99
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,159
attorney finish and Erin will you

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:17,469
provide it and lastly I welcome all the

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,620
presentation and prevent future if we

102
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:32,830
can go to the nest

103
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:36,550
thank you has been rising hmm as we can

104
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:56,680
see from the road the cyber the cost of

105
00:05:36,550 --> 00:06:01,990
time has risen from I was also against

106
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:06,300
critical first right for example just

107
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:11,160
just me match it was reported that a

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,760
you're at Solway attack infrastructure

109
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,670
belonging to a United natural gas

110
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:22,800
operations facility for similarly

111
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:27,520
compressed in the style betrayed last

112
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,190
organizations can rely on internally

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,109
generated cyber intelligence to protect

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:37,990
them against the rising trend

115
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,810
hence permission sharing has been

116
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,620
proposed as an effective and efficient

117
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,770
way of improving tuberose i by

118
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,460
intelligence from birth pains so what we

119
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:54,520
did in der stadt examine

120
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,229
which is sharing in the content of right

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,539
in the content of private entities

122
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,260
caring for the intelligent with each

123
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,840
other this is because other entities

124
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,730
there which could shed over trade

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:14,820
information how to conceal them if an

126
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:18,550
information Jim or enmity is there

127
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:24,510
potentially protected under their

128
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,510
protection and privacy law antitrust or

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:38,320
intellectual ethical to consider their

130
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,960
profession and private still more as it

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,909
has been sighted at greatest constant

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,739
for that are private entities willing to

133
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,720
participate in cyber trade information

134
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,290
sharing

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,740
so by revealing with predictions of the

136
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,770
laws and regulations refutes the sharing

137
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,690
of cyberthreat information we hope to

138
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,640
provide guidance and incentive for

139
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,270
private entities willing to participate

140
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,870
in social adventures especially for

141
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,760
critical infrastructure protection so

142
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:18,040
let's look at the background of this

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:20,560
article cyber training actually refers

144
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,530
to information that can help and

145
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,570
organization identified at first

146
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:34,720
monitor on respond to cyber threats

147
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:37,809
there were two information architecture

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,420
that is usually deployed by private

149
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,789
entities that participate in several

150
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,650
information sharing the host is the

151
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:51,040
centralized activator organization

152
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,400
issued for the Sen your cemetery

153
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:02,589
formation between the participating

154
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:05,110
entities a centralized architecture is

155
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:14,150
what we have in the information

156
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:29,530
and I was sharing the highest years that

157
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:37,209
we have around the second is coming

158
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:37,209
directly in 20 very as we know

159
00:09:43,690 --> 00:10:05,230
organization information sharing and

160
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:09,260
also exploit the collective experience

161
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:13,610
and analytical capabilities of the

162
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,640
participating entities this and other

163
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,190
apathy derive from participating it's

164
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,310
like that an information sharing

165
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,160
however there are also challenges that

166
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,510
private entities that will need to

167
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,579
participate in so you have to consider

168
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:37,280
one of those is the establishing shot

169
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:41,410
relationship it's usually difficult as

170
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,250
we to establish trust between

171
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:48,260
individuals so when the efforts at the

172
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,870
cost of establishing trust relationship

173
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,710
who even the sweet fragrance it is

174
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:59,800
willing to participate in cyber trail

175
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:04,670
information sharing in addition

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,680
interoperability and automation also

177
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:12,250
they have to also consider make on the

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:17,900
abilities and the organization's

179
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:20,330
reputation which could which

180
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,550
which the fame would happen if they

181
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:27,370
participate in such in cyber trail

182
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:30,680
information sharing so regardless of the

183
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,080
the main goal for us tempers article was

184
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,029
to look at the level ability level

185
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,350
issues that are that are related to

186
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:43,370
cyber threat information sharing for

187
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,380
between private entities so let the rest

188
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,750
a number of laws that we considered so

189
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,920
let's look at this loss in the messes

190
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:56,420
light so the loss we considered are the

191
00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:01,910
loss in the EU no way and the u.s.

192
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:04,370
because those in the EU and us models

193
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:08,480
for such laws and regulations in many

194
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,270
jurisdictions around the world so what

195
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,000
we considered the loss because that we

196
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:18,010
examined in the EU for this particular

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,750
article the first one is the directive

198
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:26,330
2016 directive 2016 of July 2000

199
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,230
assisting also known as the Network and

200
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:34,610
information system directive this is

201
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:38,180
this is the the first EU wider cyber

202
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,480
security legislation which is aimed to a

203
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:45,109
hand cybersecurity across the EU

204
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:51,110
critical infrastructure also we also

205
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:54,020
looked at the popular GDP error which as

206
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,870
we know has been hailed as the model for

207
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,640
data protection and privacy law in Boots

208
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,360
EU and Beyond and the EU cybersecurity

209
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:10,520
acts which provides permanent mandate or

210
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,459
EU agency for cyber security so for no

211
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,880
way what we did was to look at the net

212
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:21,829
no agent National Security Act also

213
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,050
known as the security adds it is mainly

214
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:27,130
concerned with the security rated

215
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:30,530
information information system and

216
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,899
objects or infrastructure is essential

217
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,040
for basic

218
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,370
national functions which are the

219
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,310
critical infrastructure and in the u.s.

220
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,040
we considered the cyber security

221
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,959
information sharing acts which is comes

222
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,860
which is regarded to be the most

223
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,689
significant service related legislation

224
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,100
so these are the laws we reviewed in the

225
00:13:50,690 --> 00:14:00,649
Attic all right and from our review we

226
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:04,130
were able to have we able to have some

227
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:06,079
insight into what the outcomes of this

228
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,810
review and this outcomes will be

229
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:15,079
described in the discussion forum in the

230
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:17,300
nest light in general the survey of the

231
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,279
existing laws and regulations in

232
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,310
addition with the current discussions

233
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,360
among practitioners indicate the cyber

234
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,910
threat information sharing may be lawful

235
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,420
so private entities that intend to

236
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,800
participate in sharing is a sharing

237
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:39,829
venture should just take care that the

238
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,410
information the shame does not contain

239
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:47,060
information that are protected by data

240
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:49,189
protection and privacy laws however when

241
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,369
the processing of personal data is

242
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,949
necessary several authors argue deaths

243
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:59,660
legitimate interest of data controller

244
00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:03,979
under Article six one F of the GD P R

245
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:09,019
can be used as a legal basis so to

246
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:11,600
conclude this presentation there is no

247
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,000
doubt the cyber threat information

248
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,870
sharing increases the overall cyber

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,380
intelligence and defense so what we have

250
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:24,620
done in this press in this article is

251
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:30,139
look at the laws assistant laws in the

252
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:33,139
EU go away and the u.s. that are related

253
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:35,690
to several information sharing to be

254
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,060
able to understand the provisions that

255
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,089
could support

256
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,719
okuru shields the sharing of cyber trade

257
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,370
information to provide guidance for

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,290
primary entities

259
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,800
are willing to participate in such

260
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,630
sharing ventures so our study indicates

261
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,449
that processing of cyberthreat

262
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,180
information and subsequent sharing with

263
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,240
others in a bid to protect network

264
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,279
infrastructure and improve overall cyber

265
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,980
intelligence and defense can be

266
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,189
considered legitimate interest on the

267
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,100
GDP are for processing of any personal

268
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:16,150
theorem that may be found in cyber

269
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,360
threat information for future work it

270
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,160
will be interesting to consider

271
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,650
approaches that organisations may employ

272
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,260
to automate Sabbath trade information

273
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:30,279
sharing and seek conform with the

274
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,380
existing laws and regulations so details

275
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,920
of this attic if you for details of the

276
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,010
article you could take a look at the

277
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,349
publication on the site so you could see

278
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:45,670
all the results and the descriptions of

279
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:51,600
of the database that was conducted as

280
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:54,069
part of the study for this article so

281
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,350
thank you so much for listening and

282
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:01,510
you're welcome to ask me any question in

283
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,280
forward I'll be glad to respond to them

284
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,809
thank you thank you very much Levinas i

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
think i have a reflection and a question

286
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,699
to you what I really appreciated about

287
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,410
your paper is you're very pragmatic type

288
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,000
of demystifying the subject to a

289
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,500
personal data protection and privacy for

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,569
incident responders it may not be the

291
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,980
world's most academically complex

292
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,530
question but the prevalence of those

293
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:31,090
worries about the impact of GDP are upon

294
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:33,370
a threat the cyber Incident Response and

295
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,000
Prevention is something that sort of if

296
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,530
you look at the aggregate impact it it

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,559
does really affect our cyber security

298
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:44,920
capacity so I know that you're a

299
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,309
neurotic Lee also had briefly examined

300
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,340
the other legal legal risks that apply

301
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,580
so in in comparison or if you take this

302
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,850
sort of sum total of your your insight

303
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,299
of the of the legal risk for for the

304
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,189
threat information sharing how

305
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,559
prevalent or how weighty do you see the

306
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:07,039
concern of breaching gdpr and and

307
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:13,759
privacy regulations to be for service

308
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:18,289
providers today the issue here is that

309
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:21,860
there were a beautiful discrepancy in

310
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,049
what is considered private information

311
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,119
when it comes to cyber trade information

312
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:28,610
sharing for instance for instance some

313
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,070
of the technical some of the technical

314
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:38,019
information that is shared as federal

315
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:38,019
trades intelligence some like baby

316
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,470
ruling in Germany that considered that

317
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,869
IP address helps personal information

318
00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,559
but there are also rulings as they new

319
00:18:53,869 --> 00:19:02,480
IP address consider that information it

320
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,480
becomes a bigger concern for service

321
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,139
providers but if it is not considered

322
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,899
personal information then it's no longer

323
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:14,330
much of it because I'm so but there are

324
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:18,649
also additional cyber threat information

325
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:21,199
like contextual information like

326
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:24,559
contextual awareness that are likely

327
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,379
usually they are most likely to contain

328
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,769
personal information but the sharing of

329
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,209
such information are not really

330
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:38,210
prevalence in cyber threat information

331
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:41,629
sharing schemes so for me it depends on

332
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,009
if the IP address which is one of the

333
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:45,498
major part of the cyber threat

334
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,840
information is considered a personal

335
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:51,289
information or not that would determine

336
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:57,049
if the service providers should worry so

337
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:59,029
much about the GDP thank you very much

338
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:01,759
for your for your presentation and for

339
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:05,809
your free response so next up we have

340
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:07,460
mr. Neal crush waha presenting his

341
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:10,710
article on government data sovereignty

342
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,299
in the cloud written jointly with

343
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,460
a speaker in our previous session

344
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,480
premise Lovera Kooskia and bruce watson

345
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,610
and niels list of accomplishments is an

346
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,360
inspiring read in its own right

347
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:27,149
he's the recipe recipient of the 2019

348
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,860
royal medal of bravery award which I

349
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:31,770
understand is connected to his longtime

350
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,870
passion of mountaineering then moreover

351
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,330
he's a motivational speaker guest

352
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,969
lecturer at Stellenbosch University and

353
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,799
the founder of impending a Canadian

354
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,950
public sector oriented consulting

355
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,870
company and he's workforce at the

356
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,880
intersection of cyberspace security and

357
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,010
law and he has published on a broad

358
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,549
range of subjects connected to these

359
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,830
topics and aligned with his PhD research

360
00:20:53,549 --> 00:21:00,950
he supports nations with their cyber

361
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:04,649
programs so mr. khuswaha take it away

362
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,049
thank you very much good morning

363
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:09,299
afternoon and evening to all and thank

364
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,070
you for joining first I must recognize

365
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,500
the great partnership of my my

366
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,408
colleagues as previously stated here dr.

367
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,890
Rogowski and and dr. Watson for their

368
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:23,279
invaluable contribution to the paper I'd

369
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:26,640
also be amiss if I didn't thank the CCDC

370
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,710
obese icon team the peer reviewers the

371
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,360
audiovisual team and many more for their

372
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,159
hard work in making everything we're

373
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,908
experiencing yesterday today and

374
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,429
tomorrow a success I'm missing Talent

375
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:41,309
a little bit nostalgic with the with the

376
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,590
lanyard here the enthusiasm among the

377
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:46,350
delegates and the hospitality I really

378
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:50,250
hope to reconvene in person next year so

379
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:52,199
let's get to started I'm just throwing

380
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,730
this up here to kick off a discussion on

381
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,799
sovereignty for those of you who aren't

382
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,320
familiar so that's why I threw that up

383
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:01,139
there in the first slide so last year at

384
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,789
saikhan 2019 mike schmidt discussed how

385
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,179
certain breaches of sovereignty via

386
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,879
cyber means may not be as clear compared

387
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:11,399
with a violation of territorial

388
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,450
integrity and inherently governmental

389
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:17,039
functions although the UN Gigi Rican

390
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,919
census confirming that sovereignty

391
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,710
applies to the conduct of states of ICT

392
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,830
related activities and jurisdiction over

393
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,340
ICT infrastructure

394
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,529
within their territory what about the

395
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,559
data stored within that ICT

396
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:35,049
infrastructure and what if the data

397
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,210
happens to be stored on ICT

398
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:42,190
infrastructure in another territory so

399
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,200
let's consider this scenario here and

400
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm going to again read from the slide

401
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,909
because it's gonna be on screen so

402
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,679
please forgive me for that so let's jump

403
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,529
right into this a governmental

404
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,130
department in state a extends a contract

405
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:59,769
to a cloud service provider

406
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,110
headquartered in state beat state aid

407
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:05,169
department consumes various cloud

408
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:08,080
services storing transactional data like

409
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,389
emails calendars etc and master data

410
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,139
like names address social insurance

411
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:16,439
numbers and an income in the csps data

412
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:18,610
centers located in state a and

413
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,360
replicated in other data centers under

414
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:26,559
the CSP s control specifically in state

415
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,689
B consider further that state B may

416
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,600
authorize its law enforcement agencies

417
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,450
to access all data stored by csps

418
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,769
registered in state B and oblige those

419
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:44,340
CSPs to preserve and handover the data

420
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:44,340
on production of warrant alternatively

421
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,080
let's say the data in state B s data

422
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,299
center is breached by foreign non-state

423
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,049
actors and copied to data centers

424
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,629
located in state C the non-state actors

425
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,389
then publicly share the content from

426
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,630
state C data centers for anyone to

427
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:07,539
consume exposing conversations contacts

428
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,539
and state a citizen data risking

429
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:13,960
identity theft cyber crimes and more in

430
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:16,360
both examples state a loses control over

431
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,419
its data at the same time enabling

432
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,570
another sovereign especially invariant

433
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:25,659
to a to exercise control over that data

434
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:30,010
by virtue of being stored in that

435
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:31,899
state's territory our article explores

436
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,690
the concept of data sovereignty and

437
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:37,389
asked whether unconsented access to

438
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,670
government data stored abroad

439
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,910
would constitute a violation of a state

440
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,540
sovereignty and what states can do to

441
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,460
ensure continued control over their data

442
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,159
so if you start with one technological

443
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,670
sovereignty and then to the slightly

444
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,400
narrower term of digital sovereignty we

445
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:00,460
come to data sovereignty given that

446
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,160
territorial territoriality loses its

447
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,620
importance with respect to data in

448
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,110
cyberspace the main aspect of data

449
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:12,520
sovereignty becomes the exclusive

450
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:15,040
authority or control with respect to

451
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,559
criminal proceedings the u.s. cloud act

452
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,379
and EU proposal make it easier to

453
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:23,200
quickly request and gather electronic

454
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,750
evidence however this places of burden

455
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,049
on CSPs being prepared to respond to

456
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:32,470
potential 6-hour or ten-day response for

457
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:34,809
a production order likely means CSPs

458
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,910
will invest in resources to help manage

459
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,820
these quick turnaround requests and by

460
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,950
that these investments are unlikely to

461
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,320
be in each nation in which it operates

462
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,580
and will probably be in a central

463
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,409
location at least for the smaller CSPs

464
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,990
due to the volume and velocity of the

465
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,760
log data CSP is looking to remain in

466
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,280
good standing with their respective

467
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,980
governments and laws may consider

468
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,250
keeping active copies of their customers

469
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:06,280
metadata possibly their customers data

470
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,520
in their headquartered country for easy

471
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:13,418
centralized parsing this duplication of

472
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,990
data into CEA's in another country may

473
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:19,059
result in a breach of sovereignty while

474
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,250
constant parsing of customer data and

475
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:25,360
metadata may be considered a breach of

476
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:28,210
privacy our paper performs a high-level

477
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,340
evaluation of the US UK executive

478
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,280
agreement along with France Germany and

479
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,470
Poland position so starting with the US

480
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,620
UK agreement we have some observations

481
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,960
and noted some limitations under the

482
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,959
agreement US law enforcement is not

483
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,350
obligated to notify third plan

484
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,630
requesting their data from the UK to the

485
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:52,760
US and UK can request data of purse

486
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:56,000
in another country creating conflicts

487
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,070
with other laws and three the agreement

488
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,450
does not address governmental data or

489
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:04,879
government employee data the agreement

490
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,820
covers only production orders for data

491
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,850
of individuals that is needed to combat

492
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:14,270
serious crimes not industrial or

493
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,059
government data neither does it give the

494
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:19,580
UK government a way to address potential

495
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:25,428
production orders for governmental data

496
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:27,678
by American law so be it under the cloud

497
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:30,169
act or provisions of other domestic law

498
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,360
actually so the issue remains unresolved

499
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:38,929
by the agreement in 2019 the French

500
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,240
Senate convened an inquiry on the topic

501
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:44,510
of digital sovereignty in its final

502
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,299
report presented by BAFTA Michelin gay

503
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,220
they examined the question of cloud

504
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,918
storage and extraterritorial

505
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,350
jurisdiction it found that one data

506
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,909
localization rules might be important

507
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:59,658
with respect to securing digital

508
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,789
sovereignty and to data stored with us

509
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:04,960
headquartered CSPs and France data

510
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:09,830
centers do not reduce the risk posed by

511
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,860
US cloud act and three it criticized the

512
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:16,789
cloud act as being too broad regarding

513
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,949
and the infractions covered and a type

514
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:22,158
and amount of data collected they also

515
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:25,039
found the cloud act to pose a risk of

516
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,169
access by American law enforcement to

517
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,140
strategic data of legal persons and to

518
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:33,140
be incompatible with the gdpr its

519
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,539
protection of personal data finally for

520
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,940
the report suggests several mitigations

521
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:41,658
and for this presentation we singled out

522
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,669
one scene on screen it's clear the

523
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:46,400
report suggests that France is concerned

524
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:49,330
about US and Chinese extraterritorial

525
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,070
release restoring extraterritorial reach

526
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,539
brought on by their dominance in the

527
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:57,770
software and hardware sectors

528
00:28:53,539 --> 00:29:00,408
respectively we we believe they they

529
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,450
must take part of me they believe based

530
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,590
on our paper we we believe as well they

531
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,900
must take robust

532
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,820
action to protect French data and

533
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,630
strategic interests from foreign states

534
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:14,658
including the u.s. moving on to Germany

535
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,429
much like France Germany is also deeply

536
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:20,330
concerned of their digital sovereignty

537
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:22,100
specifically with respect to US CSPs the

538
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,980
German government has repeatedly

539
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:28,820
stressed with any solution as stressed

540
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,440
any solution and needs to respect the

541
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,740
fundamental human rights and and

542
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,419
facilitate cooperation between states

543
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,059
Germany has taken some key actions to

544
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:40,520
put themselves in a better position one

545
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:42,740
they have limited the type of data that

546
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,980
can be stored on u.s. cloud services

547
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,350
this first action is driven not only by

548
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,570
the government but by regional data

549
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,189
protection agencies for example the

550
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,559
Hessian Commissioner for data protection

551
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,750
and freedom information freedom of

552
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,490
information has forbidden schools in the

553
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:03,890
land of HESA to use Microsoft Office 365

554
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:06,260
services or to store students personal

555
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:10,370
data in the cloud if the providers are

556
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,929
subject to US law they're developing and

557
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,120
second they're developing an autonomous

558
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:18,830
solution Germany's kicked off project

559
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:23,320
Gaia x-blade CSPs capability from within

560
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:27,649
Europe now let's move on to Poland

561
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,289
Poland has taken on two key actions the

562
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:33,739
launch of a national cloud with Google

563
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:36,129
for the private sector and two planning

564
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,870
of a gov cloud for the public sector

565
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,970
recently Microsoft has also agreed to

566
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,428
invest in the national cloud within

567
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,559
Poland it remains to be seen whether

568
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,970
Poland will exclude foreign cloud

569
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,700
service providers from their

570
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,980
governmental computational cloud or try

571
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:56,270
to secure governmental data contracts

572
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,490
and through encryption possibly securing

573
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,970
through encryption so pollen Poland

574
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:04,610
cannot rely on big national CSPs and

575
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:08,000
therefore is dependent on outside

576
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,189
expertise force national cloud and thus

577
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,090
limited in its potential quest for

578
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,090
digital sovereignty

579
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,370
so to conclude but not conclude hence up

580
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,190
in the air we can see that there is no

581
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,678
one Universal way in which states try to

582
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,679
you to ensure their data sovereignty

583
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,990
against the challenge posed by the u.s.

584
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,140
cloud act and the potential long our

585
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:37,380
jurisdiction over data stored with USC

586
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,720
SPS the reactions range from data

587
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,440
localization laws such as Russia or

588
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:47,450
China to treaty based cooperation with

589
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,160
the u.s. such as US UK agreement to

590
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:53,970
Poland's contract contract based

591
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,169
cooperation with the u.s. CSPs using

592
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,110
software solutions while building

593
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,870
localized data clusters to France

594
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,000
escaping from u.s. long-arm jurisdiction

595
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,030
by the legislative decoupling and to

596
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,700
Germany complete technological

597
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:11,520
independence all these examples show

598
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,470
that states recognize the need to ensure

599
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:20,309
data sovereignty and limit its exposure

600
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:22,980
to the control and access by less in our

601
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:25,200
view the concerns raised by ants and

602
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,049
Germany over their data sovereignty are

603
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,049
not confined to those states but

604
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:32,760
describe a universal challenge of prints

605
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:35,490
of the principle of sovereignty in

606
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,850
cyberspace states increasingly face

607
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:41,520
difficult position policy decisions with

608
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:44,309
with regards to deciding how best to

609
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:48,000
balance competing sovereign interests

610
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:50,010
based on this our paper proposes seven

611
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
actions for consideration by states that

612
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,299
have not yet specifically addressed the

613
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,730
data sovereignty issues discussed in

614
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:00,720
this paper actions a B C and D are

615
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,049
likely to be completed sequentially

616
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,169
followed by actions e F and G which

617
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:09,120
could be executed concurrently of course

618
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:11,820
all of these recommendations involve

619
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,320
speculation from us the authors and will

620
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,939
require further debate thank you very

621
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,750
much for participating and joining

622
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,010
virtually to to hear about our paper and

623
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,640
thank you once again to the entire

624
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,280
saikhan 2022

625
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,600
and thank you very much Neal for me the

626
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,460
points raised rigor is somewhat

627
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,100
philosophical or existential questions

628
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,680
on our thoughts on monopolies and

629
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,070
monocultures do you think a more diverse

630
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,980
cloud ecosystem would not only like you

631
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:49,139
rightly pointed out in your in your last

632
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,640
bullet of your last slide sort of

633
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,850
strengthened the sovereign position but

634
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,130
could it also curb the the power

635
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,189
concentration to single jurisdictions

636
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,840
and they appeal to over exert

637
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,810
jurisdiction by those regions

638
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,260
I would assume or imagine that it would

639
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:08,520
introduce more regional perspective and

640
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,590
regional voice but also regional

641
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,810
competency into this discussion you use

642
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,670
a good point there it's it's not

643
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:21,080
something ticularly studied but for sure

644
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:23,850
it it raises concern and and potential

645
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,049
limitations of space like pockets of

646
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,049
Internet if you would call it our

647
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,820
pockets of access and we're really

648
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,950
curious to see how states react to this

649
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm curious to see how Canada reacts to

650
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:39,299
this personally looking at how you know

651
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,980
the protection of Germany for example in

652
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,840
in their in their side and how they've

653
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,350
reacted it sort of does

654
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,990
create a space of their own but I think

655
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,630
it's I think it's a somewhat welcomed

656
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:55,020
idea of creating sense of sovereignty

657
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:57,270
for the data side I I am quite concerned

658
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,520
about data stored in the cloud and how

659
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,080
other nations may or may not have access

660
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,500
to that and especially governments

661
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,690
making use of such cloud capacities

662
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,050
making it much more complex so curious

663
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:12,330
to see how how nations react as well I

664
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,500
would be intrigued to I would be

665
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,690
intrigued you carry on this conversation

666
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,910
but I don't want to be stealing wait

667
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,860
time from our next speaker so thank you

668
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,509
very much again Neil I hope we will have

669
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,990
more time for questions I see that

670
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,790
coming from the audience as well so

671
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,830
finally and importantly and dr. Tina

672
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,550
Park who is a co-founder and executive

688
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,890
broad perspective to this discussion dr.

Park will present her paper about the

690
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:13,400
responsibility to protect and cyberspace

691
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,900
sovereignty as a responsibility

692
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,619
co-authored with her colleague Michael

693
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,049
Switzer

694
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:27,390
so dr. poke you are very welcome to take

695
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:29,869

696
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,308
too I'm here to microphone thank you

697
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,200
hello everyone and thank you Katherine

698
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:36,900
for that kind introduction I'd like to

699
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,930
begin by welcoming you all out for this

700
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,460
virtual conversation and also our

701
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,828
colleagues at the center of excellence

702
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,339
in Pelin who have worked so hard to put

703
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:49,819
this virtual book lunch together next

704
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,819
slide please

705
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,349
so our presentation today will be

706
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,529
divided into four key parts I'll begin

707
00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:00,750
by explaining what is r2p responsibility

708
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:02,730
to protect and move on to the framework

709
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,980
of analysis that we've used for this

710
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,380
particular chapter and discuss some

711
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,319
intersections between RTP and the cyber

712
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:16,460
domain and make some suggestions moving

713
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:18,288
forward so what is RTP you may wonder

714
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,420
responsibility to protect is a

715
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:23,579
humanitarian principle coined in 2001

716
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,410
actually under the leadership of the

717
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,510
King government and this board

718
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,730
International Commission on intervention

719
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,339
and state sovereignty produced a massive

720
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,650
report that you see on screen called the

721
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:38,069
responsibility to protect it was then I

722
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:41,220
revised and later adopted by 150

723
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:44,549
countries at the 2005 UN World Summit

724
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,500
and essentially RTP states that when a

725
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:49,369
sovereign states are unable or unwilling

726
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,440
to people fill their responsibilities to

727
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:54,019
but their own populations from mass

728
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,180
atrocity crimes the international

729
00:37:54,019 --> 00:38:00,140
community has a responsibility to do so

730
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:03,410
so to give you a very very easy examples

731
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:06,170
to relate to would be an incident like

732
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,089
the Rwandan genocide or the Holocaust

733
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,630
where the international community

734
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:13,700
literally just became bystanders - awful

735
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:17,869
crimes that were being committed in

736
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,999
different countries so RTP really comes

737
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:22,999
out of that historical context in the

738
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:25,669
post-cold war era in the outbreak of new

739
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:28,160
conflicts that we saw in the 1990s and

740
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,349
around that time humanitarian

741
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,359
intervention became a new buzzword for

742
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,400
the international community yet there

743
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,859
were controversies when it took place

744
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,039
and we saw for instance in Somalia

745
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:42,140
Bosnia and Kosovo where there were

746
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,119
different sorts of issues about

747
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,538
intervention and then when it failed to

748
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,339
take place namely Rwanda and the problem

749
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:51,769
became the militarization of

750
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:53,299
interventions using UN peacekeeping

751
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:55,098
troops as well as the issue of

752
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:59,450
selectivity you know when do you decide

753
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:01,999
to go into a conflict abroad next

754
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,308
cyclist and why is our two piece so

755
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:06,319
significant it's absolutely significant

756
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,390
because it marks an incredible shift

757
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:11,269
that both normatively and conceptually

758
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,808
from the Australian a notion of absolute

759
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:16,129
sovereignty into sovereignty as a

760
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,920
responsibility and the version that was

761
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:22,160
adopted in 2005 was limited to four

762
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,410
specific crimes namely genocide ethnic

763
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,779
cleansing war crimes and crimes against

764
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,359
humanity it is absolutely important for

765
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:31,519
us to recognize that art depicts very

766
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,769
clearly limited to these four crimes

767
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,868
because in the earlier stage there were

768
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:38,450
concerns about things like natural

769
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:40,249
disaster you know if country X has any

770
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,288
climate change related issues for

771
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:45,649
instance showing intervene and under the

772
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:48,799
frame of r2p the answer is no there is

773
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,380
also conceptual focus on populations and

774
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:53,680
the responsibilities of the state we

775
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,390
recognize individuals as the main

776
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,368
recipients of this r2p doctrine and

777
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,680
there is a very strong emphasis on

778
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,250
prevention so often when you hear about

779
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,779
our

780
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,090
seeing the meeting it's of a military

781
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,680
intervention like we saw in Libya but

782
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,470
the answer is actually that it's the

783
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,750
last resort and we always want to focus

784
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,830
on the prevention pillar of our 2p and

785
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:18,950
the r2p as it was enacted in 2005 was

786
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:21,290
very important because in Martha such a

787
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,299
widespread consensus with the

788
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,640
international community to recognize

789
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,859
that sovereignty is not absolute and

790
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,720
that was 70 concerts and set of

791
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:35,630
responsibilities next slide please

792
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:39,080
and what have we done we start to pee at

793
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:41,570
the UN levels instead well at the UN has

794
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,310
created a special office along with the

795
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,900
UN office and the prevention of genocide

796
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:51,200
and r2p advisor at the UN levels to

797
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:54,109
continue the dialogue and the UN former

798
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,060
UN Secretary General Ban ki-moon started

799
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:58,549
issuing reports which I had the honor of

800
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,560
contributing and every year there was a

801
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:05,270
report on how we can implement

802
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,720
r2p in our national governments and in

803
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:11,599
you know regional and international

804
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:15,200
organizations and the implementation of

805
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,660
it became the sort of main focus of the

806
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,000
Arctic community and a key takeaway from

807
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:23,180
this development is the three pillar

808
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,220
approach that Pangea moon came up with

809
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,589
when it comes to implementing r2p next

810
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,890
slide please

811
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:36,380
RTP has three key pillars the first one

812
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,290
is the state's responsibility to protect

813
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,020
populations in secular one on assisting

814
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:44,089
States in capacity-building and stage

815
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,920
pillar three our international

816
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:48,290
community's responsibility to use

817
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,510
various tools and take collective action

818
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,420
it's very important to recognize that

819
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,010
these pillars are to be applied

820
00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:02,990
simultaneously as needed rather than in

821
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:05,030
any sort of sequence next slide and now

822
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,080
we turn to some of the real-life cases

823
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:10,160
of r2p

824
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,670
in 2007 there was a crisis which broke

825
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,640
out in Kenya

826
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,740
then at the time kofi annan led a

827
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,140
diplomatic mission to resolve this

828
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,169
crisis with the participation of the

829
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,569
private sector and this has become one

830
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:27,420
of the success stories of our TP because

831
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,619
it marked a very important of commission

832
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,619
where the public sector and private

833
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,619
sector effectively prevented the crisis

834
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:40,250
from getting out of control and it also

835
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:40,250
showed the power of diplomacy next slide

836
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,099
yeah the success stories didn't last

837
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,920
very long because we also had a case

838
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,950
like Libyan intervention back in 2011

839
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,220
where the UN Security Council agreed to

840
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:59,520
intervene in arc with the r2p language

841
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,290
in Libya but it was a very controversial

842
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,180
again because of the regime change

843
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:10,740
involving a Gaddafi so after Libya a lot

844
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,598
of questions of course came out on the

845
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,089
selective nature of intervention and

846
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:19,579
what do you do or how do you exit after

847
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:23,240
intervening in a crisis next slide

848
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:25,920
there's also the case of RTP and Syria

849
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,779
when we and look at what's been

850
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,240
happening in Syria it's absolutely

851
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,450
appalling what we've seen since 2011

852
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,490
over a 500,000 people have been killed

853
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,169
and some eleven point eight million

854
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,959
people have become refugees or

855
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,819
internally displaced people yeah we

856
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,150
continue to see a deadlock at the

857
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:48,839
Security Council level with the p5 and

858
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:50,609
in in the sort of aftermath of Libya we

859
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,220
are always worried about unintended

860
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:55,380
consequences of intervention and really

861
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:59,939
and the geopolitical interests that

862
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:04,140
often overshadow humanitarian needs next

863
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,599
slide in Syria we see all sorts of

864
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,520
crimes being committed that are illegal

865
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,890
and banned under international law and

866
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,809
that includes crimes against humanity

867
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,308
being committed against civilians as

868
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:17,400
well as the use of cluster bombs

869
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:21,119
chemical and biological weapons and

870
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,080
really women and children who are the

871
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,720
targets of these conflicts

872
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,000
as well as incredible millions and

873
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,939
millions of people as refugees and IDPs

874
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,190
and what's been happening in Syria

875
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,990
really shocks our conscious when we look

876
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,210
at the existing tenets of law under

877
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,790
international humanitarian law human

878
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,100
rights law international criminal law as

879
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,110
well it's just I mean the universal

880
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:51,299
values of human rights that we believe

881
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:52,410
in next slides so where are we today

882
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,720
with r2p

883
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,330
there are a lot of controversy

884
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,540
surrounding the Libyan intervention even

885
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:03,480
to this day and the UN is now focusing

886
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,120
on a prevention and using early warning

887
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,710
mechanisms and technology if we could to

888
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:15,480
prevent crises from breaking out next

889
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:18,390
slide so that's where our discussion

890
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,390
really begins and on screen you see a

891
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:23,490
photo from the Rohingya and then the

892
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:28,589
crisis we're seeing in Myanmar next

893
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:31,140
slide where Facebook was used to incite

894
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,810
hate against the vulnerable population

895
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,240
so our central premise here is that mass

896
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:39,270
atrocity crimes do not happen overnight

897
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,000
and we can build capacities to prevent

898
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:44,490
that respond more effectively and as the

899
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,580
case of Facebook and Myanmar

900
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:50,009
demonstrates we do have such potential

901
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,750
in the cyber domain and our central

902
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,000
question then becomes how can we use

903
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:59,310
technology to prevent and respond to r2p

904
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,800
crimes and our frame of careful analysis

905
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,549
really derives from the UN's a framework

906
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,280
of analysis for preventing mass atrocity

907
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:11,070
crimes so through our book chapter we

908
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,930
explored how our cyber domain relates to

909
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,570
r2p in terms of challenges and

910
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:19,109
opportunities and how can we implement

911
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:24,020
it in cyber domain is analyzed into

912
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:29,340
three broad categories for our analysis

913
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:31,380
next slide and broadly speaking we

914
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,510
grouped them together based on their

915
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,820
intended effect rather than particular

916
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:38,140
technologies so the first category is

917
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,619
the cyber material sabotage

918
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,538
Jeannie was an actor to damage another

919
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:46,900
capacity to function then a cyber

920
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:49,690
information collector and manipulation

921
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,569
so this enables an actor to obtain and

922
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:56,079
manipulate information about population

923
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:57,970
or agency or even an institution but in

924
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,819
a way that may not cause immediate

925
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:03,430
material damage the last category is

926
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:05,859
societal social influence which enables

927
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:08,319
an actor to alter the perceptions

928
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:15,670
beliefs and decision-making of a given

929
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:20,079
population next slide let's move on so

930
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:24,279
our first category is cyber a material

931
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:27,369
sabotage and here we see that a cyber

932
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:29,859
terror attacks on infrastructure for

933
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:32,170
instance by North Korean hackers could

934
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,869
cause a lot of damage to our banking

935
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,029
institutions and our infrastructure

936
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,880
which we can said the resilience and

937
00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:42,549
strength of a society and in which could

938
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,849
then trigger some atrocity crimes we're

939
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:48,309
also very much aware that the hackers in

940
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:52,180
North Korea have generated billions of

941
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:53,829
dollars through hacking a base in the

942
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,879
Western world for instance which were

943
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:59,619
then used to really fund their own

944
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,999
activities so where does the opportunity

945
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:08,440
lie here although it is not possible to

946
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:11,288
attack state as actors we couldn't

947
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,180
certainly use the technology to destroy

948
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:16,299
activities of non-state actors who are

949
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,779
committing these crimes then we get to a

950
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:22,269
cyber information collection and menu

951
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:24,549
manipulation capabilities where there

952
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:27,399
are key challenges arising from

953
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:30,190
surveillance capabilities which allows

954
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,470
actors to track and target populations

955
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:37,799
so think of the Chinese government for

956
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:40,450
instance who collect data on personal

957
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:42,009
details of an individual you know how

958
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,109
tall is this person

959
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:47,330
where does he shop what kind of car does

960
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:49,790
he drive where does he go frequently in

961
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:52,069
neighborhood so this kind of information

962
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,700
could then be used against this

963
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:57,550
particular person especially if he's

964
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:00,290
somebody who is voicing opposition

965
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:03,910
against the regime there's also the

966
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,259
issue of censorship which allows

967
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,629
authoritarian regimes for instance to

968
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,640
hide some of their kinds and a case in

969
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,090
point for instance could be a North

970
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,370
Korea next slide

971
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:18,830
yet there are also opportunities because

972
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:22,009
we could call upon the state to be more

973
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:23,930
accountable and we could also ask for

974
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,760
help from different private sector

975
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:30,350
companies involved in these surveillance

976
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,500
is to use a really better corporate

977
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:35,690
social responsibility we also know that

978
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,600
there are excellent civil society

979
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,310
organizations who are monitoring these

980
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,060
issues and who are willing to cooperate

981
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:45,650
and collaborate with the citizens and

982
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,410
lastly we could also engage in

983
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,810
quantitative analysis of atrocity crime

984
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,060
risks and ensure that whatever the risk

985
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:55,790
factors are present in the society we

986
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:59,710
are notified and have mechanisms for

987
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:03,620
coordinating our response next slide

988
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:06,200
lastly we know that social influence is

989
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,540
really the hot spot after of our

990
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,210
interest because the Facebook and

991
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:13,759
Twitter and even Instagram are now being

992
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:17,810
used to undermine credibility of

993
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,520
institutions inside tape and recruiter

994
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,190
for the purposes of committing mass

995
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,870
atrocity crimes and this incitement of

996
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,690
hatred is something that could be easily

997
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,970
prevented from the corporate level if we

998
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:36,380
are to collaborate more actively with

999
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:38,240
actors like Facebook next slide so where

1000
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,550
do we go from here

1001
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,649
we could certainly engage in

1002
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,470
opportunities when it comes to hate

1003
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:48,710
speech censorship and countering hate

1004
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:51,169
that when we see that online because for

1005
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,880
too long we have just generally ignored

1006
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:55,730
what's happening in the cyber domain

1007
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,740
when it comes to educating human rights

1008
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:00,740
and we're exercising our collective

1009
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,109
responsibility we're calling for more

1010
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:07,069
careful attention on this particular

1011
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:12,200
issue and really [ __ ] to just

1012
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:16,369
incitement if it online next slide so

1013
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:19,879
are kilos first of all we argue that it

1014
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:22,819
is absolutely critical to mainstream r2p

1015
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,720
into the cyber domain or look for the

1016
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:29,569
issues of convergence where human rights

1017
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,348
and the cyber domain could intersect and

1018
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:35,690
and really move forward in mainstreaming

1019
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:39,589
some of the issues and challenges that

1020
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:41,150
we've seen when we discussed RTP second

1021
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:43,009
is investing in public-private

1022
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,079
partnership because a lot of these

1023
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,290
platforms are owned by the private

1024
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,849
sector it's absolutely critical for

1025
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:51,290
national governments and regional and

1026
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:53,089
international organisations to

1027
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,150
collaborate with the private sector in

1028
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:58,490
countering hate messages lastly we also

1029
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,470
recognize that ongoing artificial

1030
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,109
intelligence revolution and the need to

1031
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,259
use AI technology for finding innovative

1032
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:09,890
solutions before we know it we will soon

1033
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:13,299
have robots and others assisting us in

1034
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:17,290
countering such hate crimes online and

1035
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:20,180
ensuring that we retaining in our own

1036
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:22,099
privacy and freedom while also adhering

1037
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,819
to a certain set of guidelines for

1038
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:27,710
activities in the cyber domain so in

1039
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:29,839
conclusion I would once again like to

1040
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,210
thank our colleagues at the Center of

1041
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,490
Excellence and encourage you to get in

1042
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,650
touch if you have any ideas and

1043
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:38,270
suggestions you like to share and I look

1044
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,630
forward to your questions thanks so much

1045
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:44,599
for listening thanks so much for your

1046
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:47,089
thoughtful elaboration Tina I've visited

1047
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,099
the Ronda genocide Memorial in Kigali

1048
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:51,250
twice actually and it struck me how

1049
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:53,270
extensively and how purposefully the

1050
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,309
communications technology of the day was

1051
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:59,089
used in inciting the violence and and

1052
00:52:55,309 --> 00:53:01,579
also carrying out the atrocities so the

1053
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:04,609
use of communications technologies as a

1054
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:07,130
tool in conducting mass atrocity crime

1055
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:08,450
is not a new development in itself but

1056
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,819
it looks like it has made an

1057
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:13,149
amplification by cyberspace do you think

1058
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:15,710
it

1059
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,990
could also become an amplification of

1060
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,650
the tools to prevent if we're states and

1061
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:24,169
industries are willing to probe the

1062
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:25,910
complex inconvenient questions how much

1063
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:30,920
do you actually see that happening if at

1064
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:34,850
all I think it could go either way to be

1065
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:37,940
honest country because as much as we are

1066
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:40,460
concerned about intrusion of privacy and

1067
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,580
state controlling our activities online

1068
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:46,700
the fact of the matter is as we speak

1069
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:49,900
right now matter where you are there is

1070
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:53,839
greater potential for miss abuse and

1071
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:56,240
misuse and abuses of Technology in the

1072
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,020
cyber domain and when you look at the

1073
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,209
wonder what happened over the course of

1074
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:05,270
hundred days when eight hundred thousand

1075
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:07,580
people were killed and the most critical

1076
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:10,190
element error was radio transmissions

1077
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:13,190
advising people where to go and how to

1078
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:15,560
feel the same kind of procedures and

1079
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:18,110
mechanisms now a list through Facebook

1080
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,570
and Twitter and other online channels so

1081
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:22,790
all we are saying is that yes we are

1082
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:25,340
aware of a very fine line between

1083
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:27,680
individual privacy and freedom of

1084
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,960
expression and state intervention in the

1085
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,569
cyber domain but one that comes to the

1086
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,300
fore universally recognized massive

1087
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:37,130
trusting truck a crime such as genocide

1088
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,630
ethnic claims and war crimes and crimes

1089
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:41,060
against humanity

1090
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:44,090
really the types of clients that would

1091
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:47,290
appall are confident then I'm advocating

1092
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:49,700
for some sort of mechanism and a

1093
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:53,180
coordinated response where we could shut

1094
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:56,140
that down as we saw in Yammer or even in

1095
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:59,029
the Philippines where hate message and

1096
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:01,460
incitement of hate was just rampant and

1097
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:06,710
we didn't take any action to stop it on

1098
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:08,000
time well thank you again for your your

1099
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:10,130
presentation and thank you all of you

1100
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,600
for your for your presentations and your

1101
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,730
papers we do have some questions from

1102
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,290
the audience and I'm first turning to

1103
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:19,370
live Ennis if the questions first of all

1104
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:21,830
thanking you for your excellent

1105
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:23,569
presentation and the question is do you

1106
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:25,970
think that the approach to GDP are we

1107
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:33,589
change because of the COBE 19

1108
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:39,140
oh thank you we can see that happening

1109
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:45,560
not just just because now for example in

1110
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:49,400
in owing people the new application that

1111
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:51,589
was if we act on the system on their

1112
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,800
phones on their mobile devices to be

1113
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:57,980
able to track where they m to enable

1114
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,660
them when we feel if you if you come in

1115
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:03,109
contact with someone that has been

1116
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:07,310
infected then you notified and know that

1117
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:10,819
this is already privacy violation but

1118
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:13,700
you can see that unprecedented but you

1119
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:16,160
can you would be able to appreciate the

1120
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:20,899
fact that an unprecedented times cause

1121
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:24,200
for unprecedented measures so gdpr has

1122
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:29,000
actually been affected by by the by

1123
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:32,060
depend a me and this regulations would

1124
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,510
have to be changed because it was not

1125
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:38,060
actually people there was no thoughts

1126
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,819
like constants for situations like this

1127
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:43,130
right but the situations like this I'm

1128
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:44,810
also cause for maybe changes and

1129
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:47,839
modifications that needs to be

1130
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:56,270
considered when processing personal

1131
00:56:47,839 --> 00:57:00,560
information I agree with it would

1132
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:03,670
actually change the views on GDP a thank

1133
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,619
you so and there's a question for Neil

1134
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:09,560
regarding the whether it makes sense at

1135
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:12,530
this point for Canada to invest in her

1136
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,119
own sovereign cloud services as a means

1137
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:17,569
of physical safe internet that

1138
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:22,310
technology can provide so what's your

1139
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:24,319
take on this that's a dangerous question

1140
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:27,259
for a Canadian to answer I'm not here to

1141
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:29,829
answer on behalf of the crown but it is

1142
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:33,119
a wonderful question in the sense that

1143
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:35,180
should they or shouldn't they and

1144
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,220
and what would be those impacts

1145
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,230
cultivating sovereign CSPs isn't

1146
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:42,799
something that I'm opposed to I think

1147
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:46,170
it's a fantastic idea

1148
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,940
it's just whether we can we don't frame

1149
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,529
some of the costs that are implications

1150
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:52,349
or the cosmic location of that is not

1151
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:53,999
just a technological question or a legal

1152
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:56,609
question it's also a political question

1153
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:58,140
there and and those three spheres have

1154
00:57:56,609 --> 00:58:01,288
to be considered much like the three

1155
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:05,249
sort of the Russian dolls we discussed

1156
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:07,490
earlier so do I think they should

1157
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:11,549
I certainly think it's a it's a great

1158
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:13,680
consideration for investment in Canada

1159
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:16,559
in itself much like what term he's doing

1160
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:21,868
with the guy and I hope that you know

1161
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:23,999
maybe maybe it is considered all right

1162
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:26,369
thanks very much and and Tina I'm

1163
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:28,410
finally turning to you with a with a

1164
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:30,539
question of where whether the may live

1165
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,819
reactive or state assisting role of the

1166
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,980
private sector as set out in the UN

1167
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,569
World Summit outcome whether that is

1168
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:40,339
sufficient today given the global weight

1169
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:44,308
of today's will even the big five or the

1170
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:46,710
big tech players or the Gotham and their

1171
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:48,420
insight into the developments which is

1172
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:51,119
probably superior that to that of the

1173
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:53,009
states today do you think they were

1174
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,079
their own will ignorant the role of the

1175
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:59,009
private sector increase shoot it what's

1176
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:01,079
your what's your perspective that's an

1177
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:04,259
excellent question country and I am so

1178
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,299
glad that some practice because today we

1179
00:59:04,259 --> 00:59:09,210
are certainly seeing limitations of

1180
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:11,788
relying upon state as the main actor for

1181
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:14,099
preventing and respond to mass atrocity

1182
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:17,400
crimes especially when we need to get a

1183
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:20,039
certain deadlock at the t5 level at the

1184
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,369
UN Security Council and even if the UN

1185
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:25,529
Security Council were to agree upon

1186
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:27,749
intervention it's very unclear who is

1187
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:29,819
funding certain activities who is taking

1188
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:32,160
leadership and how do we exit gracefully

1189
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:34,880
after intervention and who really

1190
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,440
decides and calls the shot when there is

1191
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,869
crisis happening elsewhere in the world

1192
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,359
and I do believe that the way we could

1193
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:43,799
break through this kind of deadlock that

1194
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,630
we're seeing at the international level

1195
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:46,910
is

1196
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,310
really empower individuals and private

1197
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:53,629
sector actors as well as civil society

1198
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:56,120
and and others to ensure that our pledge

1199
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,490
of never again and our pledge of

1200
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,140
upholding collective responsibility to

1201
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:03,649
protect people who cannot speak for

1202
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:05,660
themselves is really enshrined in

1203
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:08,750
everything we do at the international

1204
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:11,509
level I think time has come for us to

1205
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:14,540
really turn to the tools offered in the

1206
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:16,700
cyber domain and also recognize that

1207
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:19,040
individuals too can make a difference

1208
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:22,970
and you know you think of journalists

1209
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:26,450
who are shooting a mass atrocity crisis

1210
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:28,970
in Africa you think of individuals

1211
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:32,390
reporting about it somewhere in Asia you

1212
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:34,939
also think of how much impact a private

1213
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:37,190
sector organizations like Microsoft and

1214
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,080
Facebook could have when states are

1215
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:41,060
unwilling to intervene so I think what

1216
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,460
we do need is certainly a political

1217
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,549
commitment to the r2p principle because

1218
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:48,800
it does mark such a breakthrough when it

1219
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:50,990
comes to sovereignty responsibilities

1220
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,760
but at the same time we do have to

1221
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:56,240
remember that we can't just rely on

1222
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,130
state you fix all these that a crisis I

1223
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,830
and in fact the responsibility falls

1224
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:04,460
upon all of us to ensure that values

1225
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:07,819
that are so dear to Negro and its allies

1226
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:11,180
and partners are upheld and that we

1227
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:13,640
actually put resources to ensure that

1228
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:18,620
our values continue to remain relevant

1229
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:20,230
in our future thank you all again Thank
