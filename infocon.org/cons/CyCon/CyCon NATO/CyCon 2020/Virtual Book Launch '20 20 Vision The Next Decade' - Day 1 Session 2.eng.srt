1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,840
welcome back ladies and gentlemen and

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,930
let's get started with the second and

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,349
final session of the strategy and policy

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:28,310
day I am honored to present our next

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:31,130
moderator dr. James shires who is an

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,290
assistant professor at the Institute of

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,260
security and global affairs at the

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,140
University of Leyden and holds a DPhil

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,920
in international relations from the

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,310
University of Oxford please James the

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,310
floor is yours

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,570
hi Ron

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,480
is great to be here and I'm very excited

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,570
to be introducing our next panel hi to

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,190
everyone online dialing in very glad you

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,790
could be with us this promises to be a

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,298
really fantastic hours entertainment but

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,820
also in depth cutting-edge academic

19
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,430
discussion our panelists are the best be

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,270
weeded possibly hope to have on this

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,460
sort of cool starting with je le J he's

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,770
a senior research scholar at Columbia

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,080
University he's got masses of private

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,380
sector and public sector experience and

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:29,090
he's also a senior fellow at Atlantic

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,339
Council he's a really great book on

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,260
cyber conflict one of the classics in

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,620
the domain called as fierce domain and

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,540
he's almost liberals right so he's right

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,240
at the center of research on cyber

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,979
conflict and without any further ado

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
it's straight - with our first

33
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,820
presentation we'll then go on to the

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,369
next speakers who will talk for 10 to 15

35
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,970
minutes and as before I'll bring up

36
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:56,750
written questions throughout are they

37
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,840
finished J floor is yours absolutely

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,659
fabulous thank you James that great

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,210
introduction good morning to those of

40
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,799
you in my content good afternoon to

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,500
those of you on our host continent good

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,250
evening to those joining in from Asia

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,430
really thrilled to be here I first went

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,400
to saikhan in 2009 and got to hear

45
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,049
Martin libecki at that event and have

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,749
been going pretty much steadily ever

47
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,960
since 2009

48
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:26,240
inside

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,220
a pointed we won't be seeing all each

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,110
other and Tallinn but so glad that we

51
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,560
can be seeing each other over the

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,900
internet the top that I have done and

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,350
represent are the paper that I did I am

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,770
representing my two co-authors JD work

55
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,700
and Neil Jenkins today and we wanted to

56
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,920
look at a significant problem in

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,450
cybersecurity practice that we felt has

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,089
been under examined through scholarship

59
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,220
we say again and again or you see again

60
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,490
and again in theories and strategies

61
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,300
that we must defend earth must impose

62
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,760
costs on the attackers that we need to

63
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,010
have more disruptions against the

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,429
adversaries so that we can cause

65
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,090
friction on this is central to the new

66
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,100
US strategy of persistent engagement you

67
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,370
see it frequently through botnet

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,720
takedowns you see it even through naming

69
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,240
and shaming um

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,950
for example whereas for example the

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,630
Dutch went and released photos of GRU

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,250
hacking teams when they were in the

73
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,870
Netherlands but there hadn't been a

74
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,710
significant way of looking at the impact

75
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,050
of those operations and so our paper was

76
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,550
called defenders disrupting adversaries

77
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,020
and what we did in this we wanted we

78
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,330
trying to go for three things in this

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,270
paper and not necessarily achieving them

80
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,580
all but at least starting to approach

81
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,490
this in a more structured and

82
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,640
disciplined way so first we have a

83
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:07,880
framework where we said how can we

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,970
better talk about in a repeatable and

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:16,608
transparent manner what we mean when we

86
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:19,488
say counter disruptive counter cyber

87
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:22,840
operations not keep using that phrase

88
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:26,919
disruptive counter cyber operations

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,359
second we include four case studies

90
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,990
using that framework of some of the

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,419
better-known incidents of disruptive

92
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,660
counter cyber operations and last and I

93
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:41,539
think perhaps most important

94
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:45,190
we have the first data set of I believe

95
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,650
it's a hundred and three different times

96
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,770
when the defenders disrupted adversaries

97
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,739
in different ways we haven't fully coded

98
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,840
that data set to the framework but we

99
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,470
wanted to get to get it out there so

100
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,419
that other researchers can work on it

101
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,600
and again we think this isn't especially

102
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:09,020
timely now that the United States is

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,320
saying that such operations are going to

104
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:17,359
form the center of the strategy to cause

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,789
friction so first let's look at what we

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,010
mean by that phrase disruptive counter

107
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,419
cyber operations again are the thing

108
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,349
that we think is most important in this

109
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,090
paper is starting to give ourselves this

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,830
transparent and repeatable framework so

111
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,169
that we're using words in a similar

112
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,510
manner and so that when we disagree we

113
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:39,820
can at least be disagreeing on the meat

114
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:43,250
of the issue and not frame so we say

115
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,010
disrupt a counter cyber operation are a

116
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,320
positive steps for defeating a specific

117
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,909
cyber adversary usually taken by

118
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,479
defenders in response to a specific

119
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:56,240
attack or campaign often directly

120
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,219
disrupt an adversaries technology the

121
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,710
main action is typically either outside

122
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,470
of the defenders own network or based on

123
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,539
specific intelligence about how that

124
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,380
adversary operates now that's less a

125
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:11,740
definition than a description and in the

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,960
paper we go through each element of that

127
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,150
description to try and pull it apart in

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,400
general we're trying to say it has to be

129
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,340
a positive action by the defender it

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,500
can't be just just passive it should be

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,810
directed at a specific adversary or

132
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,750
specific adversary operation for example

133
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,260
if you find out like just pushing a new

134
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,210
indicator to your to your firewalled um

135
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,099
that you've been told is helpful

136
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,320
well we consider that more passive

137
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:43,250
defense you're doing that for general

138
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,800
protection versus if you say we have an

139
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,710
election coming up we know the GRU tends

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,910
to use these kinds of attacks and

141
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,210
therefore these indicator

142
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,250
are specifically useful because we have

143
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,270
to defeat this adversary um

144
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:04,320
we're treating as more likely to be to

145
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,010
be in scope so after that we get into

146
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,530
our specific framework now what we're

147
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,840
trying to mention measure the dependent

148
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,950
variable is the effect in duration of

149
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,080
the disruption and you will see when you

150
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,940
check out the paper on on the saikhan

151
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,010
website that we keep these very very

152
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,070
simple it's gonna say generic but I'll

153
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:32,460
say I'm very simple measurement as many

154
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:36,000
of us know is it very very difficult um

155
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,250
when you're trying to look at all things

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,860
cyber so we try and keep it as

157
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,840
simplified as we can for example effect

158
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,840
we're just saying minor significant

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,640
decisive duration days to weeks weeks to

160
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,159
months months to years and the like and

161
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,979
the independent variables we look at

162
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,580
across different areas and let me just

163
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,840
say as a introducing the dependent

164
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,510
variable saying right look we're looking

165
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,520
to effect and duration one of the things

166
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,060
that was really stuck particularly in my

167
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,870
head as we looked at this research was

168
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,510
many of you will have seen Oh last year

169
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,050
2019 there's an adversary group called

170
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:23,690
oil rig apt Ulta went by apt 34 over

171
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:27,240
Hilux kitten that was just absolutely

172
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,960
dismantled online almost everything

173
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,020
about this Iranian group cut revealed

174
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,530
online their operations of persona their

175
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,159
malware and this really drove me to say

176
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:46,790
boy if they are able to bounce back

177
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:50,520
relatively quickly having been so

178
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,199
substantially disassembled online then

179
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,090
that tells us something very very

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,580
important about persistent engagement

181
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,880
and about disruptive counter cyber

182
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,510
operations if a group is it that badly

183
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,100
and is able to bounce back it gives us

184
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,630
incredible

185
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:12,800
important lessons likewise work um

186
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:15,439
contrariwise if apt 34 oil-rig elix

187
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,258
kitten essentially said you know what we

188
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,620
just better pack it in um this one-off

189
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,870
event was so bad um that let's just

190
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,449
disband the group and and and farm the

191
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,600
resources out to other places again that

192
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:32,689
teaches us something very very important

193
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,680
um Ned Moran of Microsoft had come out a

194
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,139
couple days ago

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,239
I'm sorry couple weeks ago and said it

196
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:42,529
looks like it was actually relatively

197
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,329
brief that they were down so we think

198
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,399
this is a very very important question

199
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,489
we hope our framework is very useful for

200
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,759
trying to help ask this in a more

201
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,470
structured way okay so if the dependent

202
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,029
variables are the effects in the

203
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,560
duration on how badly and how long an

204
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,209
adversary is disrupted on the

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,369
independent variables we say well what

206
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,560
does the type of disruption right you

207
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,389
can categorize it by the functional

208
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,609
object which is targeted or by the

209
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:12,740
action like are you st. calling traffic

210
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,569
during season control the adversary c2

211
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,839
Network we look at the the frequency of

212
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:23,329
the disruptive activity what happened to

213
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,449
oil rig apt three or four helix can was

214
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:29,680
essentially a one-off right they get hit

215
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:32,389
really really badly I think I hit once

216
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,040
that's very different from what Cyber

217
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:36,560
Command is looking for right Cyber

218
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,910
Command is looking for a more sustained

219
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,589
operation the one our case studies looks

220
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,029
at the configure working group which was

221
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:50,050
going after the configure malware a

222
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:52,910
decade ago that was sustained constantly

223
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,800
over the course of 18 months this

224
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,589
constant back back and forth

225
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,000
um the framework also looks at the

226
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,970
potential reasons for delay in returning

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,490
to operations for example in many cases

228
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,170
it's just technical right your your

229
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,170
infrastructure or c2 gets burned and it

230
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,670
just takes you a while to rebuild it um

231
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,589
I was talking to one of the very

232
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,829
experienced and well-known cyber threat

233
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,990
intelligence analysts who looked at

234
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:23,899
there was a big

235
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:26,450
takedown of announcement of adversaries

236
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,250
that were in home routers and he said

237
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,660
boy you know if the adversary had wanted

238
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,149
to they could have reestablished

239
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,949
themselves immediately but they decided

240
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,890
not to right there's no technical

241
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,440
reasons it was a behavioral or

242
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,750
bureaucratic when we also look at you

243
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,209
know there's political or geopolitical

244
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,500
right political maybe if we just say you

245
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,920
know what that groups not worth it

246
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,270
anymore they're they're out of favor now

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,339
to you political if they if they

248
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,310
adversary fears the backlash for

249
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:57,140
operating in that way again we think

250
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,329
it's very important to look at the the

251
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,819
geopolitical context of the disruption

252
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,000
as we went through the data said it was

253
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,279
quite clear on that you had different

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,220
responses whether we were in a situation

255
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,890
of peace tension crisis or or outright

256
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,490
war on the last we looked at the type of

257
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,800
adversary on both the disrupted actor

258
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,200
and the disrupt in act so that we

259
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,109
because we think that will take they can

260
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,180
be important a lot of these so for the

261
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,310
different cases I'm I won't get into too

262
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,560
many of them we looked at Code Red

263
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,670
many of you that my many of you might

264
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,880
not know code read it was back into 2001

265
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,349
and in July 2001 was actually the

266
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,890
incident that really helped make my name

267
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,390
I was when I was much younger and

268
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,470
working at a banks computer emergency

269
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,990
response team and so we say that was a

270
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,260
and we look at code rate in particular

271
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,360
because there was a there was a white

272
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,959
worm that was associated with it that is

273
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,779
someone had coded a piece of malware

274
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,239
that went and tried to inoculate systems

275
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,010
against code red so you not only had

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,700
could read spreading but you had someone

277
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,439
on that was writing their own software

278
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,390
that would that would patch the hole on

279
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,890
we looked at the configure disruption

280
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,520
there's another case study which I which

281
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,819
I've already mentioned great great case

282
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:27,709
study and very well documented including

283
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:31,830
by the the book worm which is a full

284
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:35,250
book length expose of

285
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,350
exactly how the the defenders responded

286
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,710
overtime we looked at the GAMEOVER Zeus

287
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:43,020
takedown clearly botnet takedowns or one

288
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,770
of the one of the most compelling

289
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,329
aspects of disruptive counter cyber

290
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,150
operations and one of the ones that we

291
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,070
have some of the best examples up unless

292
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,020
we look at the recall china-related

293
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,310
disclosures but this is everything from

294
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:04,890
the apt one paper which came out some

295
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:06,989
years ago and so that we can examine

296
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,970
across these case studies and using the

297
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:16,110
framework um those case studies are nice

298
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:19,730
examples but what we really hope is that

299
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:22,830
we're able the US and other add other

300
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,650
researchers are able to use the data set

301
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,110
here and right now the data set is just

302
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,420
in the PDF version I'll work with I'm

303
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,050
especially JD work my co-author that did

304
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,110
the most on this aspect of it to get the

305
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,199
data set up somewhere either Colombia or

306
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,110
Marine Corps University in a more useful

307
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,140
format for for scholars it's got a

308
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,400
hundred and three rows of different

309
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:52,530
disruptive counter cyber operations

310
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:54,959
going back to 1987 most of the cases are

311
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,900
within the last oh call them five six

312
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,790
years but as far as we know this is the

313
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,670
first real published data set on this it

314
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,770
is certainly incomplete certainly we

315
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,130
need to do more work on either ourselves

316
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:10,380
or with other researchers and scholars

317
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:13,830
to build out these data sets to not just

318
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,689
have them as a row with some sources but

319
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,860
to build them out into a more complete

320
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,990
dataset and we look forward to working

321
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,970
with many of you for that I will point

322
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,620
out that my some of my students at

323
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,470
Columbia University's School of

324
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,790
International Public Affairs did a

325
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,840
related set of work for their capstone

326
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,459
project i'm overseen by neil pollard

327
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,140
that we're looking specifically at the

328
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,910
naming and shaming aspect of what

329
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,189
happens when an adversary has been named

330
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,380
or themed i mean we hope over over the

331
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,600
coming months be putting these different

332
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,569
aspects of the research

333
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,230
gathering in one place of course we've

334
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:53,880
got some some findings listed and areas

335
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,100
for further research that you can look

336
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,560
at the paper on that and let me turn it

337
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,060
back to Matt let me turn back to Janet

338
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,709
thanks very much and I can't wait to

339
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,119
hear from the rest of the panelists and

340
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:07,859
the questions okay thanks so much but

341
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,779
don't worry to be honest the moderators

342
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,100
are pretty interchangeable so there's

343
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:18,060
not too much for probably fantastic bill

344
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,529
research and Jay does two things really

345
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,050
well which is really hard to do in the

346
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,240
same paper and is the purpose as well

347
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,670
the first is to take us back in time

348
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,589
right because a good history and says

349
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,719
look this was not something that's just

350
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,420
happened over the last year or few years

351
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,180
disrupted his life operations have been

352
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,729
happening for a long time he encourages

353
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,920
researchers it's a real impatient to go

354
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,870
back look for these historic cases see

355
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,040
what we can learn from them on the other

356
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,829
hand he also says this is a strategic

357
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,110
change as we know the strategy of

358
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:51,719
engagement and defend forward has

359
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,870
prioritized these far above the previous

360
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,079
place in the hierarchy of strategic

361
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,610
options in the US so he makes both those

362
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,430
points which are not easy to do together

363
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,530
our next speaker takes the strategic

364
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,579
question of a system engagement even

365
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,289
further he asks what can a I add to this

366
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,359
what are the elements of the system

367
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,760
engagement and new strategic questions

368
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,649
raised by artificial intelligence is a

369
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,199
part of a person to do this because he's

370
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,870
a really broad range of research topics

371
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,990
in this area I first encountered his

372
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:28,229
work with a article on bonus woman

373
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:32,549
dualism cybersecurity research very

374
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:35,549
aptly and in my opinion far too late

375
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,070
bringing lightness back into computer

376
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:42,809
science and cybersecurity for research

377
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:45,270
so without any further pontificating on

378
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,980
my part I can tell you over to what he's

379
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,690
an assistant professor at Virginia

380
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,330
Commonwealth University and he teaches

381
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,510
across the whole world is purity policy

382
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,210
and political science and conflict

383
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,460
analysis and he's got a wide range of

384
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,950
published work books and many

385
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,050
and I really heard you to check them out

386
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,520
as well as the current paper which we'll

387
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:12,950
talk about now Chris it's all yours

388
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,840
thank you can you hear me yeah great

389
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,150
cool well thank you very much and thanks

390
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,370
as well just right off the bat to both

391
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,670
sets of my co-panelists for right such

392
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,379
interesting papers both of them do

393
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,690
different but very very critical things

394
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,960
one of which of course is the production

395
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,640
of a dataset J and your colleagues that

396
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
is something that is in short supply and

397
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
the academic side of the cyber conflict

398
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,780
Studies field and I'm looking forward to

399
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,280
hearing from cure his in Kim's paper is

400
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,870
as fascinating I think we've all kind of

401
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
been asked that compelling question you

402
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,280
know what if 2016 the political

403
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,899
interference in the US elections which

404
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,030
is the paradigm case that people hold up

405
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,590
what if that was a I enabled right it's

406
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,090
kind of the what if 9/11

407
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,040
you know the terrorists were cyber savvy

408
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,870
you got a similar kind of compelling

409
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,960
question so I'm I'm really excited to be

410
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,239
on this panel so in the paper I

411
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,250
published in the Proceedings of this

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,640
year's icon which can go on the website

413
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,050
find it's called problems of poison I'm

414
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,440
specifically looking at the intersection

415
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,450
of cyber operations and developments and

416
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,430
artificial intelligence methods so this

417
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,590
is part of a pretty broad project for me

418
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,890
but I think the scope of this paper is

419
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,659
of paramount significance as we begin to

420
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,300
think more clearly about the impact of

421
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,610
AI systems on cyber and that's because

422
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,680
this paper I wrote attempts with you

423
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,810
know policymakers and strategic planners

424
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,480
in mind specifically to try to offer

425
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:39,149
some categorical breakdowns of what AI

426
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,370
will do for offensive cyber and then

427
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,260
toluca strategic implications there off

428
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,360
for national strategy and particularly

429
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,100
with the new persistent engagement

430
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,760
approach that's been adopted here in the

431
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,290
US and mind so I was particularly

432
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,690
thrilled to see the several papers this

433
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,170
year of proceedings Luke at AI from

434
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,910
variety of perspectives as most people

435
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,280
as many of the people listening to this

436
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,110
almost certainly know AI is you know not

437
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,070
exclusively something of the future or

438
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,800
even the near future

439
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,629
AI as this you know basket of

440
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,090
technologies the link advances in

441
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,029
machine learning and reasoning robotics

442
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,599
automated preset

443
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,309
etc AI has been used in applications

444
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,009
across many sectors of Industry and

445
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,418
society over you know the past couple of

446
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,819
decades particularly over the past few

447
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,739
years and at this point the scientific

448
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:31,479
and industrial field of AI machine

449
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:33,129
learning research is immense that said

450
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,839
at least within the academic and

451
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,579
practitioner communities interested in

452
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,948
how a I might transform national

453
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:41,049
security the research program is

454
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:43,689
certainly not non-existent but it's just

455
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:45,699
not picking up a little bit of speed and

456
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:47,649
thus far you know when I was preparing

457
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:49,659
to submit something for psych on this

458
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,428
year I was looking at this project which

459
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,469
it was partly underway at the time I

460
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,299
noticed the you know remarkably little

461
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:57,699
had been done to apply theory and

462
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,649
attempt to assess how a I might actually

463
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:01,029
transform the you know the character of

464
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,728
the strategic environment in which

465
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:06,549
states have to act to secure their

466
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:11,139
national interests so I think I'm the

467
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:13,089
first of the AI papers you know it's

468
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:15,248
like on this year so let me just do that

469
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:16,418
our very brief what is AI and in the

470
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:18,009
interest of time I want to leave the

471
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,809
more fleshed out technical discussions

472
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:22,959
to the panelists are going to come over

473
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,629
the next couple of days but broadly I

474
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:28,989
think about AI as a field defined by the

475
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:31,478
goal of moving beyond the mere

476
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:34,149
programmability of contemporary computer

477
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:36,699
systems to build complex thinking

478
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:39,279
constructs that are capable of concept

479
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:41,969
formation abstract reasoning environment

480
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,489
recognition and and specifically

481
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:47,559
self-improvement and since the days of

482
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:49,509
you know Norbert whiner and Marvin

483
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,059
Minsky and von Neumann others we've seen

484
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,339
a vast range of these kinds of

485
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,019
constructs applied in pretty narrow

486
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:57,759
turns admittedly but across pretty much

487
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:00,849
all areas of modern society in some

488
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,639
fashion you know in terms of how AI is

489
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:05,559
applied I argue in the paper that the

490
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:07,448
technologies of AI might most simply be

491
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,178
thought of as existing across three main

492
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:12,069
categories so movement sensing and

493
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:14,379
perception and then machine reasoning

494
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:16,959
and learning the last of which of course

495
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:18,728
machine learning being by far the most

496
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:21,399
revolutionary area within these

497
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:22,779
categories so machine learning just very

498
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,879
briefly so where is you know

499
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,330
conventional computing generically

500
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:28,639
involves you know putting data

501
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,559
into just generically say an algorithm

502
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,590
that then outputs some functional result

503
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,809
machine learning involves more in

504
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,299
putting both data and let's say a

505
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,010
desired result to a learner algorithm

506
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,408
you know a neural network of some one

507
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,080
kind or another that infers and then it

508
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:47,240
outputs yet another algorithm tailored

509
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,799
to allow for intelligent engagement with

510
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,120
the subject data and so what we're

511
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,769
talking about with AI here is a an

512
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,719
incredibly powerful technology

513
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:58,970
specifically because it doesn't try to

514
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,889
solve you know computational challenges

515
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,690
by piling on the processing power or

516
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:04,189
what-have-you it's trying to overcome

517
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,169
challenges by simplifying or

518
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,899
sidestepping these challenges by a

519
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,940
process of ongoing reprogramming so

520
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,649
cyber ops when it comes to cyber

521
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,840
operations that the conventional wisdom

522
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:16,340
out there is that AI you know

523
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,350
straightforwardly is going to stand to

524
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,590
make both defensive and offensive tools

525
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,850
more powerful plain and simple that's it

526
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,760
there's already a pretty large technical

527
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:29,230
body of work on what this kind of

528
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,850
upgrading of cyber by AI might look like

529
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,269
there's a there's a I think it's called

530
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,668
deep locker IBM actually created a

531
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:42,110
example piece of malware that was pretty

532
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:44,480
fascinating it posed as a an Internet

533
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,789
video you know voice over Internet

534
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,769
Protocol application and then waited

535
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:51,049
until it could visually and audibly

536
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,730
recognize its next target before jumping

537
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,230
to them so there's some pretty

538
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,710
interesting examples out there of what

539
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,240
this might look like with offensive

540
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,679
cyber I think you'd be fair to say with

541
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,389
just a couple of exceptions that we

542
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,940
probably want to be thinking about this

543
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:07,158
upgrading of cyber by AI along four

544
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,159
lines three of which are pretty

545
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,500
interconnected so the first one a I

546
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,929
pretends this I think a dramatically

547
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,059
improved ability for attackers to probe

548
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:20,149
and to understand the attack surface of

549
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:23,000
a target at some scale and that comes in

550
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:25,729
two two flavors basically on the one

551
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,010
hand at the the functional level smarter

552
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,690
malware you know has already been

553
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,789
demonstrated to be able to infer from

554
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,440
incoming data and assign probability

555
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:35,570
values to the next possible set of

556
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,330
target machines we should also be

557
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,799
thinking in from an Operations planning

558
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,809
perspective though

559
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,460
for instance maybe thinking about the

560
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:45,350
wealth of stolen data that populates

561
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,450
criminal spaces you know given the

562
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,789
manner in which you get criminal models

563
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,830
of operation often closely mirroring you

564
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,559
know global digital platform capitalism

565
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,240
models upgrading of analytic

566
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,668
capabilities on the part of criminals

567
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,649
essentially tends to increase the value

568
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,600
of stolen assets for a variety of

569
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:04,639
malicious purposes and it also probably

570
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,299
increases the incentive towards further

571
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,640
mass data theft back to the operational

572
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:13,158
level though the second area of AI

573
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,890
upgrading I Argand paper of cyber

574
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,600
offensive methods is just the inevitable

575
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,360
ability of malware to autonomously

576
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,668
select from a toolkit of operations from

577
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,678
for further spread it's fairly

578
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,440
straightforward it's already a reality

579
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,570
to some degree but relatedly we should

580
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,789
also be worried about AI program malware

581
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,039
that LNF will inevitably be able to

582
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,169
select its own strategies in addition to

583
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,690
just simple toolkit selection perhaps

584
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,610
you know avoiding some patterns of

585
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,380
approach to intrusion when given

586
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,270
defensive behavior is detected you know

587
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,120
going low and slow in order to avoid

588
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,940
compromise that kind of thing I think

589
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,309
the real added value of AI I will say

590
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,630
here is a perspective leveling of the

591
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:56,389
playing field where we're talking about

592
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,850
less well resourced actors finding

593
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,490
themselves more relatively capable

594
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,100
visa vie sophisticated state and

595
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,990
criminal actors that can already do all

596
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,539
of the above in a relatively

597
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,309
sophisticated fashion and then finally

598
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,990
of course defenders face the challenge

599
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,850
of malware that's going to be able to

600
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,059
compartmentalize itself into you know

601
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,678
different mindsets essentially

602
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,240
compartmentalizing the lessons a program

603
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,620
learns and then applying them

604
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,270
differently across different

605
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:28,639
circumstances but you know developments

606
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,620
in the offense are going to be matched

607
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,390
in many cases by the increasing

608
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,959
sophistication of defensive efforts I

609
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,640
just don't think it's I think it's a bit

610
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,529
disingenuous basically to characterize

611
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,590
the implications of AI upgrading for

612
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:44,750
cyber ops as just a tit for tat kind of

613
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,730
gradual escalation of improvements for

614
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,799
defenders and attackers because with AI

615
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,260
we also seriously have to worry about

616
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,240
subversion about you know cyber AI

617
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,280
attacks the target

618
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,690
legitimate functionality all the learner

619
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,330
techniques that get baked into all

620
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,830
manner of system and broad strokes you

621
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,949
know these kind of attacks are gonna

622
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:06,590
come in two forms input attacks the kind

623
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,530
of things that try to mislead AI systems

624
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,330
and cause them to intentionally

625
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,590
misclassify activity and then secondly

626
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,780
and this is where the title of the paper

627
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,699
comes from ever it's the look to kind of

628
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,190
compromise how the AI system itself

629
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,570
works right to poison the intelligence

630
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,040
system so that its model of the

631
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:27,530
environment just doesn't accurately

632
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,850
represent reality so there's a few other

633
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,490
things I can say there and the interest

634
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,709
of time let me kind of just jump to the

635
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:38,330
final stages of the paper I wrote here

636
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,010
talk specifically about persistent

637
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,270
engagement

638
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,750
there are obviously distinct

639
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,970
implications of cyber AI attacks and the

640
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,980
AI upgrading of cyber offices we can

641
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,430
eventually think of them for the

642
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,410
strategy of cyber conflicts in general

643
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,120
you know as smarter tools exist the can

644
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,920
more reliably avoid detection take

645
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,360
lateral reps to target scale effects

646
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,390
more suddenly and quickly than is the

647
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,860
norm today adversaries are obviously

648
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,660
potentially at least likely to exhibit

649
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,090
increased willingness to continue

650
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,980
operation under circumstances they might

651
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,820
not have previously and of course AI

652
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,200
adds new dimensions to the traditional

653
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,679
attribution perception problems we have

654
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,240
in cyberspace but with persistent

655
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,730
engagements specifically I think there's

656
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,290
some more to be said that's of

657
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,340
particular relevance given that we're

658
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,070
kind of finding our way with the

659
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,290
strategy right now so with persistent

660
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,540
engagement the idea is simply that

661
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,190
forward operation is going to allow the

662
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,320
United States other countries if they

663
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,030
adopt the strategy to both see attacks

664
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,280
before they occur and then to produce

665
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:43,300
friction that increases cost of

666
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,950
antagonism for adversary's so one

667
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,470
immediate concern I think with AI is

668
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,750
that it pretends kind of a narrowing of

669
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,400
the space within which adversaries are

670
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,410
probably going to take cost-benefit

671
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,360
calculations and then come to the belief

672
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,190
that the benefits of further action are

673
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,810
outweighed by the cost that might be

674
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,930
imposed in the domain by forward

675
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,270
offenders so especially given that you

676
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,890
know stakes of defection from agreed

677
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,170
calm conditions of competence

678
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,090
they're not typically very high in

679
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,590
political terms of cyber conflict at

680
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,299
least we think I know actually then a

681
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,559
reference a great article that one of my

682
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,330
panelists Jay Healy wrote in the journal

683
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,860
cybersecurity recently on that front

684
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,350
but particularly given that you know

685
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,090
political costs of defection from these

686
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,830
conditions the strategy outlines are

687
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,980
probably not particularly high then this

688
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,449
contraction of the space where in

689
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,940
persuasion is argued to be possible

690
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,400
ostensibly makes meaningful signaling

691
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,040
even more difficult you know case by

692
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,630
case and I think this is particularly

693
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,389
the case as well given that there's a

694
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,250
fundamental limitation contained in the

695
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,890
in the strategy of persistent engagement

696
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,870
in the contestation is essentially the

697
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,100
only method of communication involved

698
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,739
right

699
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,809
AI exacerbates the challenges that this

700
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,520
poses I think in particular a major

701
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,860
challenges that you know failed friction

702
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,200
will lead to these aggression spirals in

703
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,540
which both sides continue to escalate in

704
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,840
search of costly digital territory well

705
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,940
AI adds dimensionality to that concern

706
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,860
you know simplistically AI is likely to

707
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,200
lower the costs of reconstruction of

708
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,240
digital assets across the board and with

709
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,040
AI aggression spirals might actually be

710
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,470
somewhat attractive to adversary's at

711
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,178
least under control conditions or what

712
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,160
they believe are control conditions as

713
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:24,500
they're looking for opportunities to

714
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,450
Train defensive platforms and defenders

715
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,130
themselves to showcase strategies of

716
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,520
aggression that or might be intended to

717
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:34,880
mislead peer competitors and so on um

718
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,290
and I also adds a little bit further

719
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,080
dimensionality to the question of what

720
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:42,678
acceptable adversary behavior looks like

721
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,330
in the domain one problem is obviously

722
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,190
the centrality of cyberspace for all

723
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,870
manner of AI attacks right if you want

724
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,669
to subvert an AI model linked to

725
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,620
something beyond the conventional scope

726
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:53,120
of cyber conflict you're likely still

727
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,939
attacking in the fifth domain I'm sure

728
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,379
you might you know attack via you know

729
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,270
physical media insertion but you're

730
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,000
likely gonna attack via cyberspace and

731
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,639
so particularly if subversive attacks

732
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,830
that have increasingly real meaning for

733
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,140
strategic knowledge capabilities are

734
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,780
imperative for competitors heavily

735
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,740
invested in the use of AI then we're

736
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,210
left with this question of what

737
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,110
conventional metrics as we currently

738
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,879
have them can possibly be used to gauge

739
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,070
aggression

740
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:24,519
and I'll leave this point aside by

741
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:27,070
confess particularly salient in given

742
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,940
the P the P key strategy holds espionage

743
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,990
apart as acceptable behavior let me just

744
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,940
end with this I think a final

745
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,559
implication for AI for current

746
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,529
approaches to cyber conflict is the

747
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,809
manner in which you know efforts to

748
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:43,809
secure cyberspace might degrade the

749
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:44,620
reality of an open and reliable and

750
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,259
secure

751
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,239
you know interoperable internet cyber

752
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:51,309
strategy in the West and in western

753
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,990
states you know whether it's PE or

754
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,850
something else tend to naturally rely on

755
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,129
a great deal of trust amongst allies

756
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,590
civil society private sector partners

757
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:01,259
and with AI you know the promise and

758
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,759
problem of poisoning the battlespace

759
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,769
suggests a potentially massive wrinkle

760
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,639
for broader and Western efforts to head

761
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:12,009
a liberal world order let me leave that

762
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:15,928
there again let me just simply say that

763
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:18,909
I don't think the AI itself inevitably

764
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:21,039
means advantages for attackers over

765
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:22,809
defenders or vice versa but I do think

766
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,360
that adversarial learning techniques

767
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:27,610
certainly add complexity to an already

768
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,100
complex set of operational conditions in

769
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,860
cyberspace and there are reasons we

770
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,360
might think that there will be an uptick

771
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,939
in offensive behavior along several

772
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,289
lines you know as we go forward and with

773
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:44,009
that let me let me pass it back over to

774
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:44,009
you James and and cut myself off there

775
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:52,000
thanks so much it's such a rich paper

776
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,950
and you did a great job of doing justice

777
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,629
to it in that very short time but I

778
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,809
really encourage everyone who's watching

779
00:32:55,629 --> 00:33:00,668
to check it out get into the detail what

780
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:05,110
I think it does really well is really

781
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:07,509
have a nuanced idea of how a cyber

782
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,008
operations in different ways the

783
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:13,179
different threat group and the different

784
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:14,980
offenders defenders some will benefit

785
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:15,850
more than others some are already doing

786
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,830
this kind of thing

787
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:21,219
and it changes the cost/benefit thoughts

788
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,980
investment a rural environment to go to

789
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,409
our last paper maybe if the connection

790
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,450
between Chris's paper was persistent

791
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:31,520
engagement and questions of strategy the

792
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,280
connection between Chris's paper and

793
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,770
newspaper is in this idea of AI and the

794
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,570
difficult questions that raises about

795
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,920
the adoption of new systems and a

796
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,350
potential for self a version of those

797
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,650
systems and how those defenders and

798
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:50,300
offenders and offensive actors can both

799
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:52,940
use new techniques for intrusion and

800
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,950
influence but they can also be

801
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,760
undermined by new techniques here is the

802
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,150
stalwart in the field he's been

803
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,850
researching this for many years and has

804
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,650
produced many of the finest works on

805
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,520
cyber conflict that I've known AM relied

806
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:12,290
on throughout and he's a fellow at

807
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,590
Chatham House the director had a

808
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:18,380
conflict studies he had a great focus on

809
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,870
especially Russian actions in this

810
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,940
domain as well but I'll leave

811
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,830
Kyoto is paying more as paper and

812
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,520
introduce you to his work in more detail

813
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:30,110
so clear I would you James thanks very

814
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,030
much for that intro it's great to join

815
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,380
this all-star cast and actually this

816
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,960
panel has been set up really well

817
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,130
because it allows me to to take some of

818
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,230
the principles that Christopher

819
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,060
introduced and then apply them to one of

820
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,370
those specific domain streams that you

821
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,409
just mentioned of online confrontation

822
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,299
and in this case it is malign influence

823
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,090
subversion and destabilization through

824
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,980
disinformation now the paper in the

825
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,770
Proceedings was written jointly by me

826
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,330
and Kim Hartmann Kim is a computer

827
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,460
scientist and I'm a professional

828
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,620
pessimist about malign influence so when

829
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,840
we work together we tend to end up with

830
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,310
fairly dystopian results in this

831
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,890
particular case we wanted to look at

832
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,660
whether machine learning and AI what

833
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,279
transform the techniques and

834
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,770
capabilities and reach and impact

835
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,590
especially of disinformation and

836
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,120
information warfare overall and we think

837
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,220
that yes the the effect could be

838
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,470
transformative because up until this

839
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,390
point online malign influence the

840
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,939
disinformation campaigns have primarily

841
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,220
been operated and directed manually or

842
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,890
with the assistance of relatively crude

843
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,990
and simple BOTS because the design the

844
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,990
production dissemination of malignant

845
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:38,060
material has been processed by humans

846
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:40,279
but the trend of utilizing AI methods to

847
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,710
compose manipulated or fake material

848
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,270
that we observed during 2019 shows that

849
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,530
it's possible to automate

850
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,360
the processes that our need to

851
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,880
successfully operate this information

852
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,430
campaigns because if we think back over

853
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,720
that last year we saw rapid developments

854
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,480
in the use of machine learning

855
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,000
techniques to assist and amplify malign

856
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,430
influence efforts early in the year

857
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,380
Katie Jones on LinkedIn was the first

858
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,540
publicly identified instance of a deep

859
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,640
fake face used in a social media

860
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,350
campaign by the end of the year by

861
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,690
December this technique had gone

862
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,610
mainstream it was mass use in a campaign

863
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,810
to influence US politics across Facebook

864
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,300
that really brought this to more

865
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,400
widespread attention so what we see is

866
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,050
in the disinformation arms race the

867
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,930
capabilities that are available to

868
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,550
malign actors are developing and

869
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,910
proliferating at a hugely unprecedented

870
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,800
rate already as Christopher just

871
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,750
referred to malign influence campaigns

872
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,850
which leverage cyber capabilities have

873
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,530
caused significant political upheaval in

874
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:38,870
the United States and elsewhere but the

875
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,570
next generation of campaigns could be

876
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,920
considerably more damaging by adopting

877
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,410
machine learning for far greater

878
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,970
automation and scaling plus there'll be

879
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,290
more players in the field because

880
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,240
machine learning is no longer an

881
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,550
exquisite technology that's available

882
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,160
only to actors with enormous resources

883
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,260
it's been democratized and commodified

884
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,580
it's no longer interests nation states

885
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,320
that can access it because it's

886
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,140
commercially available or in some cases

887
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,320
at the lower levels for free so

888
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,850
campaigns will no longer depend on

889
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,190
labor-intensive human interaction with

890
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,140
their targets if we think back to the

891
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,620
2010s a successful disinformation

892
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,000
campaign needed humans at every stage

893
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,160
the concept had to be developed and the

894
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,020
material needed to be signed and drafted

895
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,540
and generator then spread through social

896
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,730
media platforms and that dissemination

897
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,529
required the utilization of profiles

898
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,840
which needed to be created in advance of

899
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,300
the campaign often manually then those

900
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,710
profiles needed to be serviced by humans

901
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,110
in order to build those social networks

902
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,540
generate followers and establish their

903
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,920
credibility but the introduction of

904
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,660
machine learning and potentially

905
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,700
artificial intelligence overall will

906
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,649
vastly enhance those capabilities for

907
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,080
automating the reaching of mass

908
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,000
audiences with tailored and plausible

909
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,330
content and that is going to render

910
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,910
malicious actors even more powerful the

911
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:57,590
bots and processes on most social media

912
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,129
platforms have become relatively easy to

913
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,660
develop

914
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,430
because they allow developers to

915
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,700
interact with the platform through

916
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:07,009
developer api's and since control panels

917
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,009
for automated postings on social media

918
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:10,970
are amateur and widely and cheaply

919
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:13,579
available and broadly accepted

920
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,078
technology it can't be that far off the

921
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:17,210
development of command and control

922
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,519
panels with disinformation operations

923
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,200
should be expected combining those with

924
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,578
parallel developments in machine

925
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,368
learning makes it likely that they are

926
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:27,289
going to control intelligent BOTS which

927
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,789
are capable of generating artificial

928
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:31,009
content semi-automatically

929
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,480
and the benefits are obvious for malign

930
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,700
actors it's a potentially unlimited

931
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,740
number of accounts across multiple

932
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,779
social media platforms that can be

933
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,450
orchestrated by one individual through

934
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:43,190
one single application spreading content

935
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,200
generated by artificial intelligence

936
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:50,960
pursuing one single and coordinated goal

937
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,460
of course plausibility won't be perfect

938
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,839
when it is machines that are trying to

939
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,690
convince humans but then plausibility

940
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,670
isn't often a criterion of success now

941
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,970
at the present moment we are studying a

942
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,490
malicious profile on LinkedIn which is

943
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:06,078
so wildly implausible that nobody that

944
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,939
examines it for more than a couple of

945
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,700
seconds will think it's a real human and

946
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,359
yet it has reeled in targets from

947
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,379
Atlantic Council Chatham House Rand

948
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,480
quite a few from Rand in fact

949
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,759
hilariously for us rands chief

950
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,769
information security officer has fallen

951
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,180
for this blatantly fake profile and

952
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:24,769
we're just trying to figure out how

953
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,919
exactly that connection is going to be

954
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:29,209
leveraged but also people who want to be

955
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,339
convinced will embrace the most

956
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,500
transparent fake current political

957
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:36,619
developments show that masses of people

958
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,420
can be impervious to evidence when they

959
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:41,240
want to practice self-deception in order

960
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,309
to keep the faith so machine learning a

961
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,140
day I may be increasing implausibility

962
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:47,359
they'll never be perfect but what they

963
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,390
are perfect for is scalability they're

964
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,490
ideally suited to that to scaling up

965
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:55,250
across massive numbers processes which

966
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,439
previously were labor-intensive that

967
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,539
also applies to some level of deep fakes

968
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,759
to creating entirely new artificial

969
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,529
individuals because the challenge is

970
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:04,640
simpler if you're creating somebody new

971
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:06,859
you just have to make content

972
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,470
convincingly realistic as opposed to

973
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:12,080
convincingly like a real person

974
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,459
so generating a chimera that is capable

975
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,470
of convincing viewers that they're

976
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,599
interacting with a real individual is

977
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,060
very easy now to scale and to replicate

978
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,280
with campaigns at close to zero cost

979
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,259
which could be aimed simply at inducing

980
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,000
the most careless or gullible individual

981
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,520
out of a target set to click on the link

982
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,010
or astroturfing

983
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,720
through mass fraudulently generating

984
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,130
messages and profiles which are designed

985
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,470
to give the impression of widespread

986
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,570
support for an idea to generate this

987
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,669
impression of political consensus in

988
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,690
order that elected leaders in

989
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:46,010
democracies are swayed into new policies

990
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,380
but even the production of deceptive

991
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,410
text by output by machine learning

992
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,490
systems is potentially highly dangerous

993
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,859
in the early part of the last decade

994
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,660
Russia found that automated systems were

995
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:58,430
inadequate to influence debate on

996
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,859
domestic or international fora and

997
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,419
social media and human intervention in

998
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:05,000
the form of professional trolls was

999
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,950
required but now with the invented

1000
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,080
development of intelligent fake text

1001
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,910
trolls could finally face replacement by

1002
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,799
automated systems for all but the most

1003
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,649
sophisticated of interactions with real

1004
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,420
humans and astroturfing with text

1005
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,060
becomes vastly easier when it's not

1006
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,369
necessary to manually craft each message

1007
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,560
or even each seed from which messages

1008
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:26,540
are developed and the result of this

1009
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,910
automation can be once again a massive

1010
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,160
scaling up of operations generating an

1011
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,868
entire fake public to influence

1012
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,180
political decisions potentially to the

1013
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:39,140
point where the fake public drowns out

1014
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,520
the voices of real human individuals the

1015
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,950
pace of development is absolutely

1016
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,509
staggering so what do we see in the

1017
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,419
paper Kim and I when we look into the

1018
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:49,609
near future near ubiquitous deep fakes

1019
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,530
in the form of video audio or still

1020
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:53,619
images accessibility of deep fake

1021
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:56,030
production continues to increase

1022
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:57,349
developments in human-computer interface

1023
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,490
science especially in the field of

1024
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,440
emotional modeling which might

1025
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,109
potentially allow deep fakes to generate

1026
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,240
real-time lifelike responses to live

1027
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,380
interactions it's that intelligent

1028
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,868
engagement that Christopher was

1029
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,720
referring to but with humans as opposed

1030
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:13,760
to with data or even more easily than

1031
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,069
that the alteration of video to include

1032
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,550
simulated inappropriate emotional

1033
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,599
reactions to discredit public figures

1034
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,530
especially as the changes may might be

1035
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,020
extremely

1036
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,970
simple and subtle and hard to detect far

1037
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,070
harder than a straightforward overall

1038
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,839
deep fake a simple example could be a

1039
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,940
politician discussing a military

1040
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,350
operation that claimed civilian victims

1041
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,280
but with his altered to show

1042
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:39,589
indifference or even approval and a I

1043
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,750
generated text allowing bots to adapt

1044
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,200
their approaches dependent on human

1045
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,640
reactions and auto-generate narratives

1046
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,379
facilitating instant disinformation to

1047
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,990
have developed responses to developing

1048
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,970
situations because an intelligent

1049
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,189
information warfare campaign should be

1050
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,589
able to identify the rising interest in

1051
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:00,260
a relevant topic or event and generate a

1052
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,880
coordinated automatic response to

1053
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,290
leverage that interest and those

1054
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,810
response patterns could include

1055
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:08,360
producing counter arguments or fake news

1056
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:10,580
or trolling or simple cheap propaganda

1057
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,340
bagillion it's on a mass scale and it is

1058
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,840
tailored to individual recipients but

1059
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,330
then it would also respond in

1060
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,610
interactions taking cues from how human

1061
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,740
targets react to the information and

1062
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,500
adjusting strategies in real-time to

1063
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,240
maximize their effect it could also

1064
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,300
change what this information is actually

1065
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,129
used for current online counterfactual

1066
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,050
disinformation efforts particularly by

1067
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,520
Russia tend to focus on trying to

1068
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,770
convince people that something has not

1069
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,110
happened a particular event has not

1070
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,759
taken place Russian troops are not where

1071
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:44,720
they in fact are they have not done what

1072
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:47,210
the in fact have AI could facilitate the

1073
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,399
opposite convincing masses of people and

1074
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,920
Western politicians that something has

1075
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,900
happened when it in fact did not it

1076
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,300
could make this vastly easier than has

1077
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,730
been the case to date and in addition

1078
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,710
the capability to convincingly reproduce

1079
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,350
the voice of known individuals could

1080
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,360
revolutionize principles of social

1081
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,490
engineering we've already seen fraud

1082
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,280
undertaken by replicating the voice of

1083
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,140
chief executive officers of companies

1084
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,550
how much further will it be before we

1085
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,080
hear the same thing applied to

1086
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,990
replicating the voices of commanding

1087
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,340
officers of military units there are

1088
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,200
implications for individuals and

1089
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,270
companies as well as for countries as a

1090
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,640
whole because private citizens face

1091
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:27,650
several different layers of risk and are

1092
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,390
facing this kind of technology high

1093
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,390
visibility individuals might be

1094
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,589
exploited and targeted in order to

1095
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,129
deceive others or to attack their

1096
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,720
reputation but less prominent

1097
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,150
people are also at risk although of a

1098
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,100
different form that's big cause as well

1099
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,590
as high-profile national security

1100
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,630
implications there's also potential here

1101
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,790
for simple fraud in use against

1102
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,980
individuals and corporations especially

1103
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,840
for example where financial services

1104
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,850
providers and manufacturers of connected

1105
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,190
devices rely increasingly on voice and

1106
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,500
face recognition to authenticate their

1107
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,540
customers in an environment where both

1108
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,670
voices and faces can be not just

1109
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,800
imitated but replicated that risks

1110
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,390
becoming no more secure than the text

1111
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,380
based authentication passwords they were

1112
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,910
supposed to replace we will continue to

1113
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,100
hear dramatic predictions of the

1114
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,569
consequences of abusive AI for political

1115
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,520
purposes some of those are justified and

1116
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,680
some of them are a little overwrought

1117
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,930
but there's another parallel process we

1118
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,790
need to bear in mind that is

1119
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:26,490
normalization of this technology driven

1120
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,470
by the increasing and widely accepted

1121
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,419
prevalence of virtual individuals

1122
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,370
especially for marketing purposes and

1123
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,680
I'm going to leave you with an open

1124
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,230
question there's a side effect of this

1125
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,660
with unpredictable social consequences

1126
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,150
and that is the continuing erosion of

1127
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,920
confidence in whether any online

1128
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,680
interaction that you have as a real

1129
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,780
person is in fact with another real

1130
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,390
person as opposed to a bot an

1131
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,430
intelligent agent a virtual individual

1132
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,710
and the question I would like to throw

1133
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,720
them in to everybody is does this

1134
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,000
predict major social change it is a

1135
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,160
problem or will it simply become an

1136
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,900
acceptable part of our online existence

1137
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,029
in the same way as so many other

1138
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,610
seemingly dramatic changes have been

1139
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:11,630
normalized in the past

1140
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,630
thank you very much James back to you

1141
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,180
thank you that's a fantastic

1142
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,830
investigation of just some of the

1143
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,830
problems that we face in terms of

1144
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:25,170
influence and artificial intelligence in

1145
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:28,640
especially modern democratic societies

1146
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:32,090
what care does really well in my view is

1147
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,190
show that these sort of state-sponsored

1148
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,800
inference operations are part of a much

1149
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,350
broader social question are sufficient

1150
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,230
elegance deep face in terms of the voice

1151
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:46,490
and images has implications of across

1152
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,640
Society from gendered relations from

1153
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,029
demo

1154
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,680
pratik structures and also economic

1155
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:55,050
consequences as well and one of the

1156
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,509
questions is whether the types of

1157
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,890
platform governments and social

1158
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,350
government solutions that can be applied

1159
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,390
across these different areas will also

1160
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,420
work for influence operations conducted

1161
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:08,160
by hostile States I'm going to move on

1162
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:13,050
to there are first of our questions now

1163
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,700
and it goes directly to Jay and so first

1164
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:17,220
up in their papers almost there first up

1165
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,379
in the questions the question is how are

1166
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,299
the attribution requirements for

1167
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,030
disruptive counter cyber operations

1168
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:29,970
different to other forms of cost

1169
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:31,890
imposition and thanks to the other

1170
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,319
panelists for the great comments it

1171
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,540
really depends on what kind of disrupter

1172
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,840
can't counter cyber operations were

1173
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,820
talking about um in many cases right

1174
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:45,860
link look at configure right here was

1175
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:48,600
one of the longest continual active

1176
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:52,170
counter cyber operations that we had

1177
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:55,319
lasting for what a year and a half and

1178
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,930
they never had an idea of who they whom

1179
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,480
they were countering um you know it was

1180
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:02,669
only it was only much later that we had

1181
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,330
a rest they were they're actively

1182
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:09,210
engaged I mean trying to stop

1183
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:12,080
um the malware and the adversaries

1184
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:14,960
behind the malware with zero sense of

1185
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:18,960
attribution of who was responsible in

1186
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,420
many of the cases that we're looking at

1187
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,270
you're countering or the defenders were

1188
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:29,790
countering the malware the command and

1189
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:33,509
control software itself rather than

1190
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:36,029
trying to go after unknown adversary in

1191
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:39,510
other cases for example and indictments

1192
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:41,460
that we include quite a few of them in

1193
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,850
the paper well they're obviously you

1194
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,520
have to have it down to persona involved

1195
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,750
and even better than just persona the

1196
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,830
organizational affiliation of those

1197
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:54,960
people so that way you cannot just

1198
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:58,259
person but you can tie it more directly

1199
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,820
to the government involved so and that's

1200
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,860
what we hope are the kinds of things

1201
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,080
that can come out of this paper is look

1202
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:06,510
where you have to have attribution for

1203
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:12,840
it and where it is where it is just a

1204
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:14,820
nice applause fantastic and this

1205
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,560
question of attribution and how far as

1206
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,870
necessary should always you put in the

1207
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,190
context of saying there are many kinds

1208
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:22,200
of attribution right there that we

1209
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,060
should perform the legal for political

1210
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,299
purposes and also technical attribution

1211
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,790
so we can get very deep into that topic

1212
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,650
very quickly I want to move on to Kris

1213
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:36,630
and ask you a question about the

1214
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:40,620
possibility for upgrading tected

1215
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:42,450
defensive actions in terms of the use of

1216
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,100
artificial intelligence if we think that

1217
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:47,250
are sufficient owner systems can be

1218
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,589
subverted can be poisoned is there a

1219
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:53,160
possibility for deceptive operations

1220
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:55,350
within defenders networks to try and

1221
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,060
poison attackers up artificial tation

1222
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:02,460
systems or is that something you don't

1223
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:03,840
see as a realistic possibility thanks

1224
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,430
and thanks for the question it's a

1225
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,550
really good one I do see it as a

1226
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,509
possibility you know as I say in the

1227
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,570
paper

1228
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:14,040
I think adopting some kind of basic

1229
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,590
assumption of a tit-for-tat gradual

1230
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,350
escalation of sophistication on both the

1231
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:22,860
offense and the defense is somewhat

1232
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:26,009
reasonable when it comes to when it

1233
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:27,360
comes to the AI upgrading off cyber but

1234
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,070
there are there are problems and the

1235
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,120
reason I chose to focus in the strategic

1236
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:36,690
level here is you have these problems of

1237
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:39,660
adversarial learning the metaphor of the

1238
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:41,430
the generative adversarial network which

1239
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,830
is at the heart of the deep fakes that

1240
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,029
are discussed and cures paper are really

1241
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:48,180
good kind of metaphor for what I'm

1242
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:49,800
talking about here as you know one side

1243
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:55,350
gets better the other side inevitably

1244
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:57,420
tries to to to compromise the the

1245
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,799
upgrading that is just they try they try

1246
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,890
to balance essentially against the

1247
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,470
offender or the defender effort but you

1248
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:07,200
know the real issue I see here is the

1249
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:10,649
kind of poisoning of the game itself if

1250
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,770
you have this situation where a game is

1251
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,450
being played between two sides but much

1252
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:18,330
of the play begins to focus

1253
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:20,490
on poisoning the basic rule set then you

1254
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:25,590
have an odd situation where actors are

1255
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:28,649
no longer necessarily you know safe in

1256
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:30,840
committing to the parameters all

1257
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,910
strategic engagement that they have that

1258
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:37,050
they initially have laid out before them

1259
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:38,580
I think an interesting thing with AI and

1260
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,260
particularly with these kind of cyber AI

1261
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,799
attacks not just you know cyber

1262
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:46,620
operations upgraded by with machine

1263
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,120
learning but actual attacks include

1264
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,920
attacks but particularly poisoning

1265
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,410
attacks themselves you potentially have

1266
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:57,290
this scenario where much low intensity

1267
00:51:52,410 --> 00:52:00,080
engagement becomes prospectively

1268
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:02,910
much more threatening to the core

1269
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,770
functional capabilities of the national

1270
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,259
security enterprise way beyond what is

1271
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,490
currently the case and so you get this

1272
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,380
situation there where I think

1273
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:13,620
strategists may be forced to either by

1274
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,600
demonstration or by explicit declaration

1275
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,410
attempt to begin to offer tighter

1276
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:21,180
definitions of what activities are

1277
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,890
acceptable on the part of the adversary

1278
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,299
and I certainly think a part of that in

1279
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:28,080
the next decade is that we'll see is

1280
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,840
strategists trying to figure out how

1281
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,480
they can demonstrate what is acceptable

1282
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,070
in a way that parses apart espionage

1283
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,570
which under the the current version of

1284
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,500
the strategy is kind of held apart as

1285
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:43,290
okay from poisoning operations that kind

1286
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,790
of thing and all this I personally think

1287
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,290
all this seems pretty likely right

1288
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,990
because the logic of persistent

1289
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:51,509
engagement emerges in trusting an

1290
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:53,850
invisible you know hand of market

1291
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:56,940
correction which works to produce

1292
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:59,819
behavioral equilibrium the strategy

1293
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,760
would surely fail though if again trust

1294
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:04,380
in the integrity of the hand flags you

1295
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,970
know actors again have to understand the

1296
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,490
limits of the game they're playing and

1297
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,799
the threat of a subverted rusa is you're

1298
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,169
gonna motivate assertive action to

1299
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,150
stabilize the battlespace and so it's

1300
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,770
again it's not necessarily a question of

1301
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,510
can the defenders counter the attackers

1302
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,310
with their own sophistication of

1303
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,790
defensive efforts absolutely they can

1304
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:28,470
it's it's a strategic question about the

1305
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:29,270
nature of the game being played I'm not

1306
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,509
so fantastic

1307
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:35,930
one meddlings very closely to keep a

1308
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:38,270
paper in terms of overall trust in the

1309
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,490
environment whether it's a conflict or

1310
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:43,070
international space of operations

1311
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:45,319
conducted by different actors or more

1312
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:48,710
broadly the information environment that

1313
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,960
we interact with as societies in the

1314
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:53,960
modern age so for kir the next question

1315
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,540
is really on this distinction between

1316
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,390
inside and outside in terms of

1317
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,700
information operations and artificial

1318
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,319
intelligence and a broad influence we

1319
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,480
see a lot of information influence

1320
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,540
operations on a moment pick up on and

1321
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,420
exploit existing social divisions how

1322
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,960
will this or did and also we see actors

1323
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,970
inside societies inside countries use

1324
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,250
the same techniques as those outside

1325
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,839
them as well for influence how does this

1326
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,880
sort of domestic and foreign

1327
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,160
interference relationship work for

1328
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:38,420
artificial intelligence enable

1329
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:40,549
difference okay we can't hear classic

1330
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,170
mistake thank you one of the underlying

1331
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:44,000
principles is common to all of the

1332
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:46,550
different issues that that's just opened

1333
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,770
up is that some things don't change the

1334
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,140
pace of technological development in the

1335
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:53,770
arms race in technical terms might be

1336
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:56,240
breathtaking but a lot of this relies on

1337
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:57,920
unchanging principles whether it's

1338
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,450
deterrence as Christopher did was just a

1339
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,160
losing - it's not just the technical

1340
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,740
side of it but also the the interaction

1341
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:06,410
between the two sides or in the case of

1342
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,629
disinformation and malign influence it's

1343
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,009
human nature it's human susceptibility

1344
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,430
so that they play on and as you just

1345
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,220
mentioned

1346
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:14,450
riding already existing social tensions

1347
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,029
as opposed to inventing them from

1348
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:19,189
scratch it's going to be vastly more

1349
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,870
complicated environment in fact it

1350
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,120
already is a vastly more complicated

1351
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,680
environment because not only have the

1352
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,600
tools for waging this kind of warfare

1353
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,160
been democratized but also there are

1354
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,980
more actors that are willing to engage

1355
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,649
in them so if we think of the the toxic

1356
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,180
super spreaders of disinformation as you

1357
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,530
just alluded to it is not just

1358
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,680
nation-states that are seeking to

1359
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,390
subvert and erode and undermine social

1360
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,419
cohesion and the liberal democracies in

1361
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:44,580
order to

1362
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,320
it's actually elected political figures

1363
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,420
in those countries themselves that are

1364
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,730
weaponizing the same techniques against

1365
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,740
their own population with no visible

1366
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,500
signs of restraint so why would they not

1367
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,779
adopt and embrace new tools as they

1368
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,690
become available put it all together and

1369
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,330
you get a vastly more messy and complex

1370
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,160
environment within which not just

1371
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:07,259
individuals but those who seek to defend

1372
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,120
democratic principles have to thread

1373
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,220
their way through and find out just what

1374
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,529
exactly is really happening of what to

1375
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,240
do about it put it all together and in

1376
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,610
fact you have a situation where there

1377
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,520
are layers upon layers of complexity

1378
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:23,580
when divining that that last points that

1379
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,630
that I made who are you talking to are

1380
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,210
they telling the truth

1381
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,400
where is the truth how can you find it

1382
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,440
it's going to be income enormous ly more

1383
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,500
challenging and of course a case in

1384
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,120
point that that proves the proves the

1385
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,260
point if you like is what's happening at

1386
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,049
the moment with online radicalization

1387
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,900
with the pandemic where people retreat

1388
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,400
more to online worlds and are deprived

1389
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,990
of that interaction with real

1390
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,030
individuals deprived of that social

1391
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,620
interaction that's often provides a

1392
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,200
reality check when they're being fed

1393
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:54,450
false information online the pace of

1394
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,890
radicalization and the pace at which all

1395
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,529
of these disinformation can see it

1396
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:00,720
moving forward is vastly accelerated I

1397
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:02,970
think that is a harbinger of what we may

1398
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,370
be facing in the not-too-distant future

1399
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,680
pandemic or no pandemic when there are

1400
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:09,750
so many different influences leveraging

1401
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,980
so many different technologies to look

1402
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,440
make it look as though there is a

1403
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,030
convincing consensus in an online

1404
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,880
environment in favor of one particular

1405
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,770
position so I did mention at the

1406
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,990
beginning our research tends to lead to

1407
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:32,640
dystopian conclusions I would very much

1408
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:34,950
like somebody to prove me wrong question

1409
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:38,370
back to Jay and it's going to go back on

1410
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:41,370
the tactical level you mentioned a bit

1411
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:43,560
about counter spy operations and that

1412
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:45,660
you see these disruptive operations

1413
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,710
taking - what is leaks into the public

1414
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,839
domain though Rick

1415
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,760
whether these are actors that are named

1416
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,110
they chained and the probably know there

1417
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,910
are activities and the other one is

1418
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,440
actually trying to target infrastructure

1419
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,710
and really spotting them doing what they

1420
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,210
do

1421
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:00,180
you see these two really different

1422
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:04,250
courses of action or they more the same

1423
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,250
you know with the same strategic effect

1424
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,300
they're not brother and sister but

1425
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,480
they're but they're certainly cousins

1426
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:19,680
and so what we're trying to do in the

1427
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:23,430
paper is to associate all of these

1428
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:25,080
together so that we can take the parts

1429
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,868
of them that are similar right of trying

1430
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,940
to take active measures on your own to

1431
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:33,089
influence the adversary's behavior or

1432
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,260
disrupt their operations um and even

1433
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,460
there you can see part of the difference

1434
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,430
right if some of these are named

1435
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,650
behavior some of them aimed at Susan

1436
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,940
making it's aimed at trying to change

1437
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,589
things that's happening in the

1438
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,349
adversary's head well that's very

1439
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:47,820
different from a bot yeah you have you

1440
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:49,560
don't care necessarily who your

1441
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,630
adversary is or what's going on in their

1442
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:55,049
head you're trying to directly stop the

1443
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:58,589
technology one is more policy one is

1444
00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:00,750
more operations but that is absolutely

1445
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:02,009
okay we can we can take what these

1446
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:08,119
things have in common

1447
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:12,240
so that defenders can look across the

1448
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:13,890
have a larger tool box to say okay we

1449
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,890
might not have for the last question

1450
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:19,950
really strong attribution we have to

1451
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:22,770
take these tools and put them to one

1452
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:25,910
side for now yet we still have this rich

1453
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:28,440
set of other tools which we can rely on

1454
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,180
um if you know your adversary is doing

1455
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,210
something but you can't be quite sure

1456
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,129
exactly what well then that one set of

1457
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,910
tools you can't use you have to depend

1458
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:40,500
on on these others that are relying on

1459
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:43,259
that are looking to influence what's

1460
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,970
happening in their in their minds some

1461
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:48,000
of this work had been done before like

1462
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:50,459
the pyramid of pain or other areas we're

1463
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:55,470
trying to you need it a little bit more

1464
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:58,200
especially for scholars that's fantastic

1465
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:00,868
and with that I have to draw to a close

1466
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:03,629
I really like to thank our phenomenal

1467
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:06,180
panelists Jay Healy Chris Pronger and

1468
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:07,890
care jobs I really encourage you to read

1469
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,069
the papers there's so much in them that

1470
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,959
we couldn't cover down

1471
01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:14,249
but thanks and a virtual round of

1472
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:14,249
applause to everyone involved

1473
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:22,149
thank you and from Tallinn thank you to

1474
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:24,549
the moderator professor shires and the

1475
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:26,079
panelists for providing us with this

1476
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:28,869
highly interesting and thought-provoking

1477
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,089
session to round off our strategy policy

1478
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:33,880
day of the virtual book launch of the

1479
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:35,890
second Proceedings also of course thanks

1480
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,179
to the audience for listening in we hope

1481
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:40,719
that the sessions in the following days

1482
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:43,449
will be equally interesting I too would

1483
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,729
like to express my thanks and we hope to

1484
01:00:43,449 --> 01:00:48,849
see you again tomorrow for the legal

1485
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:52,209
sessions at 1600 Eastern European Time

1486
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:55,499
so stay tuned and have a nice day or

1487
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:55,499
have a nice evening

1488
