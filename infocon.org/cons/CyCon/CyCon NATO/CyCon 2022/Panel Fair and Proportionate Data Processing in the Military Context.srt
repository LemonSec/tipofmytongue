1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,920
okay so can i just start by actually

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,560
acknowledging the unsung heroes of these

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,919
cycon events which is the ccds coe staff

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
including ann and i'd appreciate if we

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
can all clap

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,120
it is in the context of that book that

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
i've had a privilege of actually working

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
with hand very cl and very close closely

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,720
and it is in that context i can affirm

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,039
that she's a brilliant person and it's

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,560
been a delight to work with her on the

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
book and and um and so i wanted to say

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
that at one point or another i'll also

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,079
tell you that in person uh later um okay

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,800
so as was said we're here to talk about

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
fair and proportionate data processing

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,440
in the context of military operations

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
and i think i didn't choose the title

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
the title was chosen by ccdcoe i think

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
the title is intentionally provocative

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
and aimed to be triggering it's

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
triggering for me at least

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
because of those two words fair and

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
proportionate

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
anyone who's interested in data

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
protection would know that the word fair

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,960
usually evokes the fips those set of

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
fair information processing also

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
including security processing standards

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
that was developed by the nist in the

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
united states whereas proportionate for

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
most of us would evoke european

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
standards namely the european court of

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
human rights standards around the

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
collection of intelligence in the

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,479
context of the right to privacy under

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
the european convention or say the gdpr

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
the general data protection regulations

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,960
proportionality obligations and so we

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
have here the intersectionality of data

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
protection norms from two sides of the

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
continent and i think that that is a

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
good segue into what will be the context

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
of our discussions which is the way

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
militaries who are engaging in heavily

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
in data intensive practices might be

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,479
bound by certain of these norms

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
um that would be the scope of all i'll

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
say today okay because the real reason

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
you're here is to listen to these three

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
brilliant individuals who will each

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,840
share a presentation with you um and

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
we'll go in the order uh and i'll

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
introduce them one by one as we go along

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
starting with sebastian um

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
so sebastian simata is um uh

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
seconded by the german armed forces to

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
the nato ccdcoe as a law researcher he

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
studied law at university of munster

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,800
germany and tartu estonia before joining

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
the german armed forces as a litigator

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
in 2015 he worked as a legal advisor at

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
the german aerospace center at the

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
center at the ccdcoe center he focuses

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,400
on the application of the international

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
law to the cyber operations as well as

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,480
questions of data

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
and information sharing in the military

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,959
context all right so the way we're going

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,239
to do it is that each of them is going

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
to talk for about 15 minutes on a topic

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
that they've prepared that will leave a

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
sufficient time for q a with the

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
audience i'm not going to abuse my

75

rights as a moderator i'll leave it to

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
questions that you have as their

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,159
presenters are speaking will have a lot

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,480
of time to go over that so sebastian you

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
have the floor his presentation is

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,159
titled european data protection

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,599
legislation and its role in

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,480
multinational military operations

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
assaf thank you very much for the kind

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
introduction um

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
thank you the audience for bringing for

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
being here listening to us

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
so the title of my presentation

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,640
is

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
derived from topics and projects i'm

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
working on in my capacity as a legal

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
researcher at the center

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,920
and

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
so before i say anything anymore the

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,840
disclaimer is of course what i'm telling

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
you is my own opinion it's not the

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
opinion of

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
nato the german government or german

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
armed forces for whatever

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,760
so once we get that out um next slide

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
please

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
i think you use the

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
check

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,599
all right

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,159
so why european perspective so data

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
protection has emerged as a

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
consideration for many activities done

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
in the military context throughout the

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,599
recent years

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
well-known publicized example is the

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,439
biometric enrollment

112
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,760
during the afghanistan campaign all the

113
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
way back to isaf

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,480
um

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,360
but also like the identification of

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
targets right when we're talking about

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
targeting combatants that is something

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
that has been coming to our attention

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
more recently

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
um and but in this context when we talk

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
about this kind of campaigns which are

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,440
usually multinational no matter under

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
which security regime they are conducted

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
the exchange of data is of course also

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,919
of the utmost importance and it goes

126
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,639
even beyond sharing in theater when you

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
want to share this data collected in the

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
military frame

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
with civilian authorities right

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
so um

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
me and my co-authors from netherlands we

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
wrote a paper on this topic and um

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
we came to the conclusion especially

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
when we look at the ukrainian russian

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
situation conflict

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
that this is

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
a timely topic

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
so um

139
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
so i'm talking about the legal context

140
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
the paper we wrote is called military

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,639
data information sharing a european

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
perspective

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
and why is that why focusing on european

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,199
union law well on the one hand

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
we found the international legal regimes

146
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
in place outside of the european union

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
as well as state practices not very

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
mature not very concrete creed nothing

149
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
to really work with and at the same time

150
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
we face the fact that the european union

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,840
emerged as a military actor more and

152
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,000
more in recent years we see naval

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
operation conducted in the mediterranean

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
european training missions conducted in

155
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
africa and all of this is conducted

156
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
basically under the auspices of the csdp

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
the common security and defense policy

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
so at the same time looking at european

159
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
union law we see this as kind of a

160
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
benchmark for data protection

161
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
legislation and

162
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
we see these kind of legislation having

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
an impact all over the world influencing

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
uh organizations and state as they

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
create their own

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,039
legal regimes

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
so

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,919
as with most things we should ask

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
ourselves what's in it for nato right

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,240
why would we focus here at the nato

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
cccue on european law well for one thing

172
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
um nato consists

173
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
roughly to two-thirds out of states

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
which are also part of the european

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
union right so it's not only an internal

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
topic that you should be aware about the

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
legal regimes of your member states but

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,960
also

179
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
nato and european union are their

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
strategic goal is further cooperation

181
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
right so it's definitely important to

182
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
know how far we can what kind of legal

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
constraints are there in cooperation and

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
intelligence sharing so so much i would

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
say for so what right um creating a

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
better understanding of data protection

187
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
consideration will greatly enhance what

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,840
we call legal interoperability within

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,319
nato but also in concert with other

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
international organizations

191
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
so

192
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
diving into the legal landscape of the

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
european union first thing we have to

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
focus upon is the primary legal layer

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
the european union prior

196
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
primary law which conducts which is

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,759
basically the foundation of the european

198
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,520
union right and the key provision here

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
is article 16 of the treaty of the

200
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
functioning of the european union uh

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
article provides that everyone has the

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
right to the protection of personal data

203
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,479
concerning them

204
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
and this primary law source is supported

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
by article 8 for example of the european

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
charter of fundamental right which

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
formulates a similar guarantee

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
so these kind of provisions are pretty

209
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
well known and explored but what we

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
focused on during our paper when we were

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
researching it is a provision that is

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
actually not so um quite not quite as

213
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,000
popular as those when it's article 39 of

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,280
the treaty on european union and

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
this is an article specifically

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
providing um that

217
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
legal basis for the enactment of

218
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,680
secondary law provisions for data

219
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
protection within the domain of the cdsp

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
the eu common security and defense

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
policy uh specific calling for the

222
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
enactment of a decision which is a

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
secondary law instrument provided for in

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
article 288 of the treaty of the

225
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
functioning of the european union

226
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
and so therefore we came to the

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
conclusion that if we have pri a strong

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
primary law foundation with regard to

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,919
data protection

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
we need of course secondary law to

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
implement this um to operationalize it

232
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
for everyday life

233
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
so looking at the secondary law of

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
provision of course eu regulation 2016

235
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
679 the general data protection

236
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,039
regulation very well known the gdpr

237
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,958
which is the

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
some of whom would call it the gold

239
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,958
standard of data protection regimes

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
laying down rules relating to the

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
protection of natural persons with

242
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
regard to the processing of personal

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,519
data and also the free movement of data

244
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,480
this

245
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
protect this regulation is

246
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,279
supported by eu regulation 2018 1725

247
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
addressing the protection of natural

248
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
person with regard to the processing of

249
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
personal data by the european union

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
institutions bodies offices and agency

251
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
henced up the institutional gdpr by my

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
colleague here

253
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,000
so i'm sure we're going to hear more

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
about this but

255
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,519
taking these two very important

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,800
instrument into account for

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
implementation of data protection in the

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
european level we came to the conclusion

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
or it was very easy to find that there

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
is a gap in secondary law right there

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
are there is no no secondary law

262
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
instrument

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,600
for um data protection within the csdp

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
domain

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
so consequences of this is of course

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
that we cannot just normally and easily

267
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
turn to the gdpr or the institutional

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
gdpr because as eduardo said yesterday

269
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
during the book launch of course the

270
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
scope of limitation is limited of both

271
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
uh both of these

272
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
regulations they explicitly exclude

273
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
their application to things which are

274
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
outside of union law which is defined

275
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
for example as

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
national security what that compromises

277
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
would be for example intelligence of um

278
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
intelligence activities but also

279
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
most likely military operations and they

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
also exclude themselves from

281
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
being applied to the csdp because

282
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
they're referencing to chapter 2 title 5

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,560
of the teu making clear that

284
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,279
there is a special regime to be found

285
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,160
but

286
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,240
seeing that with this decision-making

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
decision

288
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
missing for the csdp and at the same

289
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
time the understanding that the

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
fundamental european law provides that

291
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
data protection needs to be ensured all

292
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
over the place and all over uh the legal

293
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,360
topics um

294
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
we were focusing our attention to

295
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
national solutions and one of the

296
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
solutions that i was pre what i was able

297
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
to find because my own country produced

298
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,480
it

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,120
was um that we were aware of this

300
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
limited scope of application and

301
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
therefore legally extended the gdpr to

302
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
military operations using a provision in

303
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
our national data protection

304
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,360
law

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
paragraph one subsection eight

306
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
effectively making the gdpr applicable

307
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
to the military

308
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
so the reasons for this was that we did

309
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
not want

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
holes in our national data protected

311
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,399
protection landscape

312
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
and i believe that also we came to the

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
conclusion looking at the provisions of

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
the gdpr and its underlying principles

315
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,440
that

316
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
is actually not a

317
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
super bad fit for for the military for

318
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
military affairs

319
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
so

320
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
um

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
so what we can deduct from this is at

322
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,959
some point that nations consider

323
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,240
there are some nations in europe

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
considering gdpr's provisions at least

325
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
useful or at least operationable for

326
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
military purposes and that one of the

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
opportunities one of the reasons to

328
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
achieve one of the ways to achieve this

329
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,959
would be analogous application or just

330
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
national law expansions

331
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
and

332
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,560
with this in mind i would like to

333
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,279
focus on biometric data procession

334
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,000
processing which was one of the

335
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
showcases we provided in our paper

336
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,800
with regard to data protection so

337
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
biometric data processing has been

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,480
identified as a key challenge for data

339
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,839
protection regime

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
and i believe it's at the crossroad of

341
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
technical legal operational aspects

342
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
convergence within military operations

343
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,639
not to mention that it has been

344
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
repeatedly mentioned here throughout

345
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
this conference

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
it has not only has a historical value i

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
mentioned already the afghanistan

348
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
campaign where it was used for

349
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
biometrically enrolling

350
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
afghan citizens to

351
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
organize base access for locally

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
employed personnel but also

353
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
in the ukrainian russian conflict we saw

354
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,639
this

355
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
as we there was clear news coverage that

356
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
ukraine um

357
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
uh has been using facial recognition to

358
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,920
identify dead russian soldiers and use

359
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
this information then for their

360
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,079
purposes whatever they may be

361
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
so how to address biometric data

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
processing in a military context right

363
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
so looking at the legal looking at the

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,639
gdpr we find ourselves looking at

365
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,480
article 9 which

366
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
employs a very interesting

367
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
structure because the first paragraph of

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
article 9 actually prohibits the

369
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
processing of amongst other things

370
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
biometric data which is of course due to

371
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
its sensitivity yet the second

372
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,360
sub-paragraph is an exception for that

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,839
rule pertaining to reasons of

374
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,079
substantial public interest

375
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959
and that being said um

376
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,600
i believe because of this structure

377
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
prohibition and exception this exception

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,240
has to be understood narrowly right

379
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,279
um

380
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,639
so

381
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
a decision on csdp data processing could

382
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
possibly

383
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
create a different kind of reasoning for

384
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,760
this topic yet if we are right now

385
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
looking at a german situation we build

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
actually up on this provision and

387
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
provided

388
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
in paragraph 22 of our national data

389
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
protection act a possibility to

390
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
process biometric data for imperative

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,560
reasons of defense effectively opening

392
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,519
the door

393
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,920
for our nations to doing this

394
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,199
so

395
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,440
what we can conclude from this small

396
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
part is the fact that um

397
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
the european union landscape provides

398
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
instruments for addressing these kind of

399
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,760
data protection topics but we need to um

400
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
utilize this in a way that is actually

401
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,399
applicable and therefore achieve a

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
balance between data protection and

403
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
military necessity

404
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
and

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
so that leaves me with my last slide the

406
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,880
way forward and um

407
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
i would say biometric data processing is

408
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
a great example to see the challenges

409
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,560
that are posed by data protection in a

410
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,959
military context uh being it european

411
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
union or nato and what we definitely

412
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
know this different legal standards will

413
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
always hamper the effectiveness of a

414
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
military operation uh can even like uh

415
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
put the success in doubt so therefore um

416
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,079
working towards

417
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,399
solutions thinking of ideas how to

418
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
overcome this obstacle things of

419
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
paramount important for

420
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,079
the conflicts to come right

421
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
um in the meantime i believe mitigating

422
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
raising awareness which this conference

423
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
here is a great opportunity because the

424
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
topic was very heavily featured here

425
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,120
showcasing possibilities that some

426
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
nations also the netherlands if i if i'm

427
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,639
not mistaken um applied to gdpr to their

428
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
military shows that i think there is

429
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,199
something to work with and throughout

430
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,000
the

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
um conference what i always heard was

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
the argument that we should never try to

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
reinvent the wheel for all our problems

434
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,959
but maybe look at the solutions we have

435
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,399
at hand right

436
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,920
and if everything falls we can always

437
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,079
resort to an analogous application and

438
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
see how far this brings us

439
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
but um

440
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,399
not to over obviously my welcome here in

441
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
my time frame uh let me conclude with

442
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,360
couple of recommendations um

443
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
i'm a i'm a german lawyer so i believe

444
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
in written laws so striving towards

445
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
legal harmonization i guess especially

446
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,880
the european level it would be very

447
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
great idea to enact this kind of

448
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
directive and it would even give us the

449
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
benefit of tailor-mading data protection

450
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
regime for military operations of the

451
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
european union looking at article 9

452
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,759
again right it's absolutely imaginable

453
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,519
that for a special

454
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,399
data protection regime we could say for

455
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
the csdp that hey biometric data

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
processing

457
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,560
is

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
um allowed in general provided uh legal

459
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
safeguards are met which can be

460
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,320
laid down also as well and that would

461
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,440
greatly enhance um the possibility to

462
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
conduct this mission successfully and

463
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,759
lastly because that is also one of the

464
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
things that i'm heavily involved with at

465
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
the ccdcoe i believe we already

466
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
despite all the uncertainty and all the

467
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
questions we discovered during this

468
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
conference i think we need to train our

469
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
operatives in this i need to think we

470
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
need to integrate data protection

471
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
questions into our military exercises um

472
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,480
and i can assure you the ones i'm

473
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
responsible for will feature this

474
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
heavily in the future and provide

475
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,520
training for our officers or experts to

476
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
be familiar with this

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,039
and

478
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,079
with this i would conclude my

479
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
presentation

480
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,480
thank you so much

481
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
i i truly think that germany is in the

482
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
forefront of setting some of these

483
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
standards in ways that very few other

484
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
militaries have even started the

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
conversations that you just heard uh

486
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,840
sebastian share with you today

487
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,320

professions deb is also one of the more

523
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
of the core experts for the manual on

524

uses of outer space the milamos project

526
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,720
i'm sure most of you know about she's

527
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,240
currently researching innovative

528
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
polycentric regulatory models for info

529
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
sharing stuff i'm going to sit down no

530
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
that's it that's it i'm done that was

531
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
the end

532
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
it did a lot more than me

533
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,080
and four kids

534
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
so thank you staff i really appreciate

535
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,919
it

536
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,799
so

537
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,120
on september 24 23 2016 ardeet farizi a

538
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
hacker from kosovo was sentenced by the

539
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
us eastern district court in virginia to

540
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
20 years in prison for his hacking

541
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
activities and acts of terrorism

542
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,440
what friezy had done according to his

543
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
indictment was to supply his isis

544
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
handlers including one of the leaders of

545
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
the isis hacking division and cyber

546
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
khalifa i hope i have that right his

547
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
name was junaid hussein with the

548
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
personal data of more than 1 300 active

549
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
active u.s military personnel and

550
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
government personnel and their family

551
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
members

552
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,520
this is what it looked like

553
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
names addresses photos and other

554
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
personal details were shared and they

555
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
were published no less on the us central

556
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
command's twitter feed which had been

557
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
specifically hacked by the isis hacking

558
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,480
division to publish these kill lists and

559
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,919
they were so called and you can read for

560
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
yourselves they're a little bit fuzzy

561
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
because these are old pictures but

562
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
american soldiers we're coming watch

563
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,880
your back we won't stop we know

564
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,039
everything about you your wives and

565
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
husbands they forgot and children

566
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
so this is perhaps an extreme example of

567
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
the problem we'll be discussing over the

568
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
next few minutes but it's not the only

569
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,880
one so

570
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
in 2018

571
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,280
some of you may be familiar many of you

572
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
may be familiar with the fact that the

573
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,679
pentagon reviewed gps policies after

574
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,120
soldiers strava data for military for a

575
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
non-military app

576
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,760
for

577
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
tracking physical workouts uh were

578
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
exposed and leaked broadly and which

579
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,559
enabled uh gps location uh of

580
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
thousands tens of thousands i think of

581
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
us military folks and then the leak

582
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
spreadsheet exposes details of uk

583
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,039
special focus soldiers these are leaks

584
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,559
that are not uh

585
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,760
infrequent

586
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
uh many of them are not transparent so

587
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
just sharing a few that uh we we know

588
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
about

589
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
so the question that i'm going to try to

590
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
answer in these next few minutes

591
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
is why the sharing of competence

592
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
personal data

593
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
combatants i have that right combatants

594
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,760
i think

595
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
um

596
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
which is which is

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
sort of the opposite side of the picture

598
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
a lot of the times we look at uh

599
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
practical protection of victims personal

600
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
data or uh third parties we're looking

601
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,720
at the military personnel themselves and

602
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,600
why that

603
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
which includes sensitive biometrics as

604
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
you've shared within military coalitions

605
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,200
for necessary operational and

606
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,039
administrative purposes why is that

607
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,520
becoming increasingly critical as an

608
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,840
issue of legal interoperability in

609
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,679
military coalitions

610
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,600
so the examples that we cited that i

611
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
cited are not leaks from military

612
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
coalitions obviously

613
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
they're from third party providers but

614
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
the issue is the same

615
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
coalitions

616
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
share personal data i'm sorry coalition

617
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,880
share personal data of competence all

618
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,679
the time so the need to explore how

619
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,120
domestic data regulation arrangements

620
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
which you've shared with us

621
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
specifically

622
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
how those domestic data protection

623
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,480
arrangements might be coordinated and

624
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
that's really the basis of this analysis

625
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
so the best analogy that i could find

626
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
during the research for this book

627
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,559
chapter

628
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,600
was a bit out of my league but i learned

629
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,919
a lot about how ihl practice on on a

630
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
nation-by-nation basis is coordinated in

631
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
military coalitions on a regular basis

632
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
and this legal interoperability exercise

633
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
is really really critical for military

634
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,159
operations

635
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
one example that i wanted to share

636
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,919
is nato's international security

637
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
assistance force the isaf coalition

638
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
operations in afghanistan

639
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,159
where you participated

640
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,120
i learned over lunch

641
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
he neither confirms nor denies

642
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
at the height of coalition operations

643
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
more than 130 000 troops from 51

644
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
countries participated in extended and

645
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
varied operations on the basis of u.n

646
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
security council so conflicts of ihl

647
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
interpretation

648
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,360
among the member countries

649
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,679
included a wide variety of issues that

650
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,360
needed to be bridged and needed to be

651
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,919
turned into

652
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,960
practical interoperability mechanisms so

653
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
that the coalition could move ahead with

654
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,919
its work and again we're still in the

655
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
ihl context so

656
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,039
issues such as the nature of the

657
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,480
conflict itself

658
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
the rules of engagement rules applicable

659
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
to the the detention of competence and

660
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
non-confidence targeting criteria

661
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,919
so

662
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,279
issues like this are subject to

663
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
coalition members i learned red flagging

664
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,600
and national caveats

665
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
for the use of the military forces it

666
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
has to be that way

667
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,559
summing up this tension between domestic

668
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
domestic domestic provisions of ihl

669
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,400
interpretation and ihl doctrine david

670
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
goddard wrote in 2017.

671
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
stay with me through the quote

672
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
individual states may be responsible for

673
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
in-law for some though not necessarily

674
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
all of the activities conducted under

675
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,440
the auspices of a coalition of which

676
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
they're apart

677
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
as a result each coalition member has a

678
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,440
particular interest in satisfying to its

679
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,799
own standards

680
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,279
uh what the lawfulness of the conduct of

681
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,039
its troops are in military operations

682
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
so the emphasis is as follows the

683
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
challenge ultimately concerns the need

684
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,240
for states

685
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
to protect their own legal interests

686
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
while minimizing the impact on the

687
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,760
overall effectiveness of the military

688
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,600
coalition's operation so

689
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
focusing on the protection of these

690
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,159
types of legal interests

691
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,640
moving and moving from the

692
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,799
interoperability model or paradigm from

693
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,840
ihl into data protection

694
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
this is what was really explored in the

695
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
in the research that i did

696
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
how does this paradigm of ihl help us to

697
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,159
understand the need for data protection

698
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
interoperability well let's give it a

699
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,640
shot first of all let's put aside

700
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
bullet

701
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
2.3

702
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
which is the cyber security issue it's a

703
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,440
critical issue obviously any data

704
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
sharing that's done uh by on the part of

705
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
members of coalitions obviously has to

706
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
be

707
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,640
on an information the information

708
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,919
sharing platform that's used it

709
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
obviously has to be

710
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
tightest possible cyber security

711
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
controls that's a whole other

712
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,039
presentation and a whole other issue we

713
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
do need to know just to mention this is

714
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,159
part of the discussion it'd be great to

715
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
have questions about this later that

716
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
gdpr and other

717
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
selected

718
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
national rules national regulations on

719
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,919
data protection sorry

720
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,760
do incorporate technical measures for

721
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
cyber security so the nist which assaf

722
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,919
already

723
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
mentioned

724
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
the toms in the gdpr

725
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,120
um

726
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,159
these are all that is the iso 2700 and

727
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,919
2701 these are cyber security measures

728
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,000
that are sort of the underpinnings of

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
data protection

730
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,679
in some regulations more

731
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,480
more declared and in some less we're

732
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,919
putting that aside for a moment it's a

733
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
whole other topic it's a critical one

734
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,720
but we don't have

735
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,520
the time to go into it at the moment

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
what i found so interesting about what's

737
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
left of the issues to discuss is that

738
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
they're not exactly ihl in fact

739
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,679
as we discussed yesterday in the book

740
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
launch probably not ihl at all at least

741
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,240
not in its present form

742
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
not really international law

743
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,880
not quite domestic law but somewhere at

744
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
the nexus of all of these and that's

745
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
what was so intriguing to me so what's

746
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
the problem

747
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,960
here we have a sort of stylized version

748
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
of how coalitions share information

749
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,200
or

750
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
more what types of information they're

751
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
going to share mostly operational

752
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,679
but just sort of turn in your mind the

753
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,679
personal data that's included in all

754
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,159
these particular types of military

755
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,799
operational data and administrative data

756
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,960
and hr data that are shared on a regular

757
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,600
basis by any military cooperation

758
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,360
military coalition that wants to get its

759
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,640
job done

760
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,440
okay

761
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,279
taking the nato case

762
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,679
as an example which was

763
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
the case the main case study of the

764
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
article

765
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
just sharing the tip of the iceberg here

766
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,399
within a nato coalition

767
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,799
typically on a regular basis look at the

768
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,200
quantity of data protection regimes that

769
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
we have

770
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
in place on a day-by-day basis on an

771
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
hour-by-hour basis so we've heard a lot

772
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,880
about the european regime

773
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
uh it's obviously a leading one and for

774
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
most of the coalition members in nato

775
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
but we've got canada we've got the u.s

776
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,720
we've got um

777
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
uh i think we have the maldives i'm not

778
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
remembering the other two flags uh

779
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
others may be able to help me and we

780
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,039
have the u.s which as we all know does

781
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,720
not have a federal data protection law

782
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,520
yet

783
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,600
lots of bills running around in congress

784
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
for that but we do have hipaa okay so

785
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
even thinking at the initial level of

786
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
how we do legal interoperability of

787
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
these regimes alone

788
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,679
and leaving aside the fact that on

789
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,360
specific nato operations there's going

790
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,440
to be more and more and more and more

791
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
countries that are participating and are

792
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,399
going to be needing to share personal

793
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,399
data on a regular basis how do we even

794
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,199
think about this

795
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
and more than how do we once we start

796
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
thinking about it how is it a

797
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,360
substantive legal issue and this i admit

798
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,120
maybe a bit of a stretch because i'm

799
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,399
going to sort of

800
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,880
give the promo for one of my conclusions

801
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
in my own mind anyway is that we really

802
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,799
have

803
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,240
a good

804
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
techno solution

805
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,320
or practical solution to a legal problem

806
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
and i'll get to that at the end so just

807
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,880
giving you a little bit of something to

808
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
think about

809
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
why is it important to have legal

810
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,720
interoper to have interoperability of

811
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
data protection regimes so look at some

812
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,279
of these issues weapons use

813
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
some countries may have as part of their

814
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
operational doctrine limitation on use

815
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
of certain weapons by people with

816
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
certain health issues physical issues

817
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,279
physical health issues mental health

818
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,480
issues that data needs to be accessible

819
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,919
for the purposes of that particular

820
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,960
country as an example

821
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
geolocation of competence on leave

822
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
does that belong to the military should

823
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,840
it belong to the military how do we deal

824
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
with that where do we store that

825
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
information what do we do with it and

826
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
how do we resolve the conflicting

827
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
approaches of different countries and

828
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,840
finally as in so many other contexts

829
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,960
covet 19 brought us the prime example of

830
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,760
where this is really a problematic issue

831
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
so cover it and this one

832
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
what covid has

833
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
required military coalitions to do as a

834
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,159
matter of course

835
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,520
is to receive

836
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
sensitive personal information under all

837
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
of the data protection regimes that we

838
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
know about

839
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
about the health of forces that need to

840
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
be deployed

841
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,480
so if contingent country contingents of

842
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,760
country a have been swept by coven 19

843
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,240
infections they can't be deployed

844
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
okay that kind of information

845
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
is critical on a day-to-day basis in

846
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
military coalitions how do we how does

847
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
nato look at that so

848
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,440
i read i'd be very happy to have any of

849
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
the nato folks in the

850
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
in the room enlightened on this point i

851
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,000
read every single nato document that was

852
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
published on

853
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
that possibly approached this issue and

854
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,760
i did find a little bit of a hint that

855
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
indicated where nato is on the on the

856
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,360
topic and

857
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
it was not very encouraging because read

858
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,919
the bottom lines

859
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,799
the struggle to engage in this legal

860
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,399
interoperability was very much

861
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,399
acknowledged by nato under its joint

862
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,000
doctrine for medical communications and

863
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
information systems terrific but no

864
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,480
solution has been uh achieved so far at

865
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
least not uh a solution that was shared

866
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
publicly so currently the creation of an

867
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,240
all-nato approach to how to do this

868
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
legal interoperability of data

869
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
protection regimes

870
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,519
is in process

871
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,279
again if anyone knows different in the

872
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
room i'd be absolutely thrilled to find

873
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,960
out how that's working so uh but but at

874
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
least it's been pinpointed in this issue

875
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,120
goes back us off to

876
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
bring these topics up in order for us to

877
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,559
start thinking about how to deal with

878
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,399
them

879
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,719
um

880
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,559
the detailed analysis of the gdpr and

881
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
institutional gdpr i'm going to leave

882
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,080
aside you can read about it in the

883
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,320
article but it does leave it's really a

884
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
re-emphasis of your point that there is

885
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
a little bit of an opening under the

886
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,000
institutional gdpr i know you and i have

887
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
a difference of opinion about how wide

888
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,120
that opening is we can talk about it a

889
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,279
little bit later uh i want to get to

890
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,679
some of the final points

891
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,440
where does this complexity lead us and

892
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
where to and when boots hit the ground i

893
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,600
love that metaphor so metaphorically and

894
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
physically

895
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,679
so

896
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,279
countries need to look much more

897
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,679
carefully at their own data protection

898
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
regimes in order to understand how their

899
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,000
militaries are compelled and you've

900
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
given some examples of at least an

901
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
example of at least one country that's

902
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
actually looked at this

903
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
what do countries want to bring into

904
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,840
their own understanding in terms of

905
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
active military

906
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,679
activities

907
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,080
as in terms of the data that militaries

908
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,840
want excuse me that needs to be

909
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
protected even in military context so

910
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
that's task number one

911
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
and the law will determine that there

912
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,399
may be carve-outs but it's a legal issue

913
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,399
get the domestic lost rate and then the

914
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,880
next task is to start having these

915
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
conversations in the context of the

916
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,799
military coalitions

917
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,880
and that i would close the circle and

918
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,399
bring us back to the ihl

919
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
interoperability discussions those are

920
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,159
issues for red flags and national

921
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,000
caveats okay same same

922
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,279
for the how

923
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,080
uh i want to get back to the issue of

924
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,960
really quickly to a really interesting

925
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
technical solution

926
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,279
that helps i think to solve this

927
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,519
this this legal problem

928
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,720
and it was kind of a surprise to

929
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,399
discover this any of you who work in the

930
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,640
data privacy field eduardo you may talk

931
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,279
about this later knows that regtech is a

932
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,519
big is a big deal regulat

933
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
the regulation regulations of technology

934
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,240
so platforms that allow for

935
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,279
uh in the private sector for companies

936
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,679
to figure out which data subjects enjoy

937
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,679
which which rights under which

938
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,840
regulation so a company called arch

939
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
archdis i've spoken to them i have no

940
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
stock in the company so i'm not this is

941
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,559
not an advertiser for them they've done

942
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,080
this for

943
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,919
multinational coalition operations they

944
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,840
have a product on the shelf that

945
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,760
actually does this

946
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,880
for

947
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,559
data protection laws

948
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,159
and it was a fascinating conversation

949
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,760
with the two sales reps i called them

950
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,919
and i said look i'm not in the market to

951
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,440
purchase but can you tell me about what

952
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,240
you do and it was spot on it was really

953
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,480
a tool that uh they put in a lot of

954
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
effort obviously the cyber security

955
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,320
issues come in sort of from how you're

956
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
going to protect this this platform but

957
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,399
the reg tick exists so it's an

958
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,159
interesting you would ask us to look a

959
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,279
little bit at the private sector

960
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,279
contributions the private sector is

961
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,719
already doing this

962
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
let's see how we can sort of bridge

963
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,359
those gaps

964
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,960
concluding points challenges and trends

965
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
and i'm gonna i'm four seconds to go i

966
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
want to leave you with what really keeps

967
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,800
me up at night

968
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
so you can read through the slide um

969
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,239
which does the summary

970
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,239
where i'm

971
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,800
really restless and really concerned

972
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,760
is with these these the two sort of top

973
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,119
top bullets

974
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,239
um

975
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,918
big things are happening with digital

976
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,760
identities of all of us

977
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,159
and the military is not exempted from

978
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,719
these dramatic changes in how

979
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
we are constructed as human beings in

980
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
the digital space

981
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
and anyone who believes still that there

982
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,040
are any boundaries between our civilian

983
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
identities and our military identities

984
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,440
and our commercial identities has it all

985
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,480
wrong in my in my respectful view

986
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
how are we going to start to think and

987
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
cope with in terms of military in the

988
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,119
context of military coalitions with the

989
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
absolute merger of digital identities of

990
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
soldiers

991
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,079
a support uh support

992
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
individuals who provide support and

993
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
their families and what do we do with

994
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,920
this wealth of information about their

995
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
identities once it's all on a shared

996
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,880
platform for the for military coalitions

997
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
and finally what really

998
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
what's really keeping me awake and then

999
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,320
i'll finish with this is

1000
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,079
that

1001
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,320
increasingly as weapons become more and

1002
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
more digitized

1003
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
and the capability of a tracking what's

1004
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,359
done with a particular weapon and what

1005
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,720
it does in the hands of a particular

1006
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,440
individual may very quickly bring us to

1007
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,680
a point where we not only know

1008
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,760
which competent has used weapon x to

1009
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,400
inflict damage why

1010
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
but who on the other side of the lines

1011
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,680
or the person or people that have been

1012
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
killed by that person or injured by that

1013
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
person including collateral damage

1014
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
victims once that's all digitized and

1015
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
i'm not sure it's too far away

1016
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
how do we manage that piece of digital

1017
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,240
privacy so i'll leave you with that

1018
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
thank you

1019
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,359
what i think is particularly fascinating

1020
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,359
in deb's book chapter and the

1021
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,599
presentation today highlighted that is

1022
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,440
um the fact that you chose to focus on

1023
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
military personnel um i think that

1024
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,800
it is unfathomable for a military to say

1025
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,640
just because you chose to serve in some

1026
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,200
countries churches are mandated to serve

1027
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,119
you somehow lose what is constitutional

1028
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,800
protections or entitled to lower

1029
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,359
protections and so that automatically

1030
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,040
generates these obligations that might

1031
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,200
be at play in these contexts and the

1032
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
fact that there's a product on the

1033
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
market suggests that there's clients

1034
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,680
also and so to the extent that anyone in

1035
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,839
this room was thinking that this is kind

1036
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,599
of future oriented pie in the sky

1037
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,400
discussions it really isn't it's live

1038
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,800
and well in the work of militaries and

1039
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,560
with that we're going to move to our

1040
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,359
final speaker for today which is eduardo

1041
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,480
ostrand

1042
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,960
global co-head of hogan laval's privacy

1043
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,040
and cyber security practice eduardo is

1044
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
widely recognized as one of the world's

1045
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,760
leading privacy and data protection

1046
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,079
lawyers and thought leaders with over 25

1047
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,760
years of experience at broadway advises

1048
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
multinationals and governments around

1049
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,880
the world on the adoption of privacy and

1050
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
cyber security strategies

1051
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,400
edwardo's presentation is titled

1052
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,599
applying data protection impact

1053
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,839
assessments in a military context why

1054
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,119
and how

1055
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,200
thank you very much and good afternoon

1056
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,160
everybody

1057
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,880
so

1058
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
in a sense i as i was listening to your

1059
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,560
presentations i felt that we were

1060
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
running this panel a bit like like a

1061
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,400
military operation from the point of

1062
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,599
view of

1063
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,480
i think we we heard a very strategic

1064
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
approach to to the legal framework

1065
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,119
and then we focus on the very specific

1066
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,000
issue of the interoperability of laws in

1067
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,640
the context of the sharing of data

1068
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,440
and

1069
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
i want to go

1070
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,800
narrower into

1071
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,720
a particular tool

1072
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,040
exploring a particular tool

1073
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
that i think

1074
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,119
would be and will be increasingly

1075
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,160
relevant

1076
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,720
in the context of achieving

1077
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,079
what

1078
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,400
the main question of the panel was about

1079
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
fair and proportionate

1080
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
use of data in the context of military

1081
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
operations

1082
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
and that is the role

1083
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,560
of data protection impact assessments

1084
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
and you may or may not have heard

1085
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
that term before

1086
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
but

1087
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,079
my my mission here is to show you why

1088
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
this is relevant and how we can help you

1089
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
in achieving this

1090
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,839
compatibility

1091
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,280
of

1092
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
your mission and the use of personal

1093
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,040
data

1094
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
and the starting point like this the

1095
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
starting point of most things is to

1096
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,000
explain why this is relevant

1097
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,839
and

1098
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,800
i also thought that it would be

1099
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,839
easy for for all of us involved to start

1100
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,359
with something that perhaps you are more

1101
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,160
familiar than even i am in this context

1102
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,000
which is the this concept of

1103
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,359
international

1104
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,240
humanitarian law the body of law that

1105
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,079
regulates

1106
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,880
the

1107
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,839
conduct of armed conflict and it is at

1108
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,079
the root of that

1109
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,119
that we start our our mission here and

1110
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,400
our action

1111
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,280
because within within that body of law

1112
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,800
and of course which

1113
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,599
originates from from the

1114
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
conventions from the geneva conventions

1115
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
there is

1116
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,280
one particular piece of legislation and

1117
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,839
one particular provision

1118
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,400
within the first additional protocol

1119
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,760
which is

1120
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,920
article 36

1121
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
of that first additional protocol and

1122
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
you may or may not have read that

1123
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,400
but what it says

1124
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,839
is that

1125
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,720
in the context of

1126
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
armed conflict

1127
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
there is an obligation

1128
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,640
to determine at the outset so before

1129
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,319
anything else happens

1130
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,560
whether

1131
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,880
the employment and by the employment we

1132
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,000
mean

1133
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,599
the development

1134
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,720
the the the actual use

1135
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,880
the way in which

1136
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
a particular

1137
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
new weapon

1138
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,200
can actually be used

1139
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,800
and to what extent

1140
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,839
that

1141
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,480
may actually be prohibited

1142
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,359
by that body of international law

1143
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,359
and that is an obligation that already

1144
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,000
applies and has been been in operation

1145
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
for a number of decades

1146
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
so when you look at that obligation and

1147
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,319
how you

1148
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,440
operate operationalize it as you also

1149
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
refer to

1150
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,599
the question is so what is prohibited by

1151
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,040
international law we see so many things

1152
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,839
that are happening in in today's today's

1153
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,400
conflict that you would think well isn't

1154
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
that prohibited by international law

1155
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,440
isn't that

1156
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,200
that sort of action we're watching it

1157
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,520
live on tv isn't that

1158
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,119
prohibited

1159
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,000
and

1160
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,160
in that context

1161
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
again you may be more familiar with

1162
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,640
these terms and these ideas that

1163
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,880
something that is prohibited

1164
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,359
is this idea of having a weapon for

1165
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,000
example that infringes the principles of

1166
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
humanity

1167
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,040
and the dictates of public conscience

1168
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,560
but that's quite woolly

1169
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,079
in the whole scheme of things that's

1170
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,440
very sort of

1171
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,040
um

1172
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,680
abstract if we go a little bit

1173
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,640
deeper

1174
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,440
what we really

1175
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,359
encounter very

1176
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,800
almost immediately

1177
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,240
is that

1178
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,760
in that deployment of weapons and in

1179
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
seeking that

1180
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,920
illegality if you want or

1181
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,240
confirming the legality

1182
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,079
one of the important aspects

1183
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,079
is actually

1184
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,720
the rights of individuals our our rights

1185
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,400
as human beings

1186
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,200
and there is a whole body of law

1187
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,079
that is goes in parallel with the

1188
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,560
international humanitarian law which is

1189
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,520
the international human rights law

1190
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
which of course

1191
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,880
includes amongst other things the right

1192
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,359
to privacy

1193
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,319
and

1194
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,040
this seems to suggest

1195
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
that in applying that article 36 that

1196
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
idea

1197
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,319
that one has to

1198
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,920
verify and analyze and determine whether

1199
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,079
what we may be developing or what we may

1200
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,920
be employing

1201
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,440
is prohibited

1202
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,400
one of the factors to take into account

1203
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
in the law today

1204
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,119
is to what extent that may infringe

1205
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
human rights including the right to

1206
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,118
privacy

1207
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,400
here is where my friend the gdpr fits

1208
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,599
saying this is

1209
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
my more familiar territory

1210
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,760
we've heard about the gdpr and how

1211
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
it came about

1212
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
modernizing a few years ago the existing

1213
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,480
framework of data protection law in

1214
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
europe

1215
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
it's been in operation for exactly four

1216
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
years

1217
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,200
and it's still developing but there is

1218
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,440
an element there's some articles one of

1219
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,200
the new

1220
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,640
aspects

1221
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,760
that was

1222
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,319
created by the gdpr

1223
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,160
which is in article 35

1224
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,720
of the 99 articles of the gdpr article

1225
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,400
35 is the is a key one in this context

1226
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
because

1227
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
even though there's no relation to the

1228
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,280
first additional protocol it does

1229
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,079
have

1230
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,400
a degree of similarity

1231
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,000
because what it requires

1232
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,800
is

1233
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,560
to undertake an assessment

1234
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
of the impact of the use of data so

1235
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
we're not talking of naturally a weapon

1236
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,400
but the use of personal data

1237
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,200
but

1238
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,839
especially when new technology has been

1239
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,560
developed and is being employed

1240
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,440
and

1241
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
to assess

1242
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,480
whether

1243
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,319
that impact is likely to have an adverse

1244
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,960
impact a high risk

1245
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,560
to what is called the rights and

1246
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,079
freedoms of the individual again

1247
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,560
including the right to privacy

1248
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,599
this is where the concept of a data

1249
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,200
protection impact assessment

1250
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,880
can be very helpful in relation to the

1251
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
article 36

1252
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,839
of the first additional

1253
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,079
protocol so we go from from something

1254
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,000
that was created in 1977

1255
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,960
to something that has now

1256
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,400
been

1257
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,560
devised in the context of the most

1258
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
modern and ambitious perhaps data

1259
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
protection framework in the world

1260
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,280
and how one relates to the other and

1261
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,440
this is why

1262
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,880
the deployment of

1263
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,119
a data protection impact assessment may

1264
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,920
actually be very useful

1265
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,560
when assessing compliance with

1266
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,839
international humanitarian law

1267
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,800
the question is how do we do that

1268
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,160
how do we do

1269
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,240
a data protection impact assessment as i

1270
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,079
said it's new

1271
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,680
it was four years ago there was no

1272
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,800
law in the world

1273
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,800
that had this type of tool

1274
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,599
at our disposal not only

1275
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,880
in a way that

1276
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,640
we could use it but in a way that it is

1277
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,839
compulsory to deploy it in the context

1278
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,119
of the use of personal data so how to do

1279
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,800
a data protection impact assessment

1280
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,960
shouldn't be too complicated

1281
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,520
it's even it's even doable let's put it

1282
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,079
this way in the battlefield

1283
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,440
and

1284
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,040
the way it works is that of course you

1285
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,640
need to understand

1286
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,599
what type of uses of personal

1287
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
information a particular

1288
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
weapon for example

1289
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,920
may involve

1290
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,200
and there is

1291
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,920
a degree of information gathering if you

1292
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,200
want

1293
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,839
where you need to analyze the facts so

1294
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,079
let's let's just use a practical example

1295
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,400
here to to make to to to bring it i

1296
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,200
guess

1297
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,480
closer to home let's imagine

1298
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
for the sake of it

1299
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,359
that we are

1300
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,839
devising or designing

1301
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,400
a new drone

1302
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,560
and that this run

1303
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,440
is going to have the ability

1304
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,240
to use biometric information which you

1305
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,520
refer to

1306
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,960
specifically

1307
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,920
facial

1308
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,240
recognition technology

1309
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
and in addition to that

1310
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,760
it's going to have

1311
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
the capability using let's say

1312
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,839
artificial intelligence to make

1313
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,400
decisions as to how to deploy the

1314
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,960
capabilities of that drone so the drone

1315
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,160
is going to be flying around looking at

1316
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,359
a particular

1317
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,880
population and maybe just maybe

1318
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,560
identify a particular target

1319
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,680
so how would that work how would that

1320
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,720
new weapon comply with this article 36

1321
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
was the idea that how is this is this

1322
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,480
going to comply

1323
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,720
and amongst all the other

1324
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,680
issues that one would need to look into

1325
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,440
you would need to look into

1326
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,160
the extent which the use of information

1327
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,000
the application of facial recognition

1328
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,280
technology in that particular context

1329
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,599
is indeed lawful

1330
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,800
so

1331
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,359
here's what an assessment

1332
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,359
of that technology would look like you

1333
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,920
would look at a number of factors a

1334
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,000
number of principles if you want that

1335
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,359
are covered by

1336
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,680
the gdpr by european data protection law

1337
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,839
but these are principles that in fact go

1338
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,480
into your point about interoperability

1339
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,920
most

1340
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,720
legal frameworks around the world

1341
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,160
that have been developing data

1342
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,960
protection law over the past 30 years

1343
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,920
will have in common

1344
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,240
so let's look at those factors and how

1345
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,280
our imaginary drone may comply with it

1346
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,000
transparency this is a really tricky one

1347
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
transparency is a lot it's about telling

1348
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,119
people

1349
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,040
what you do with your data it's easy if

1350
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,960
you're selling online and you put a

1351
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,359
privacy policy on on a website if you

1352
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,440
are flying a drone that is has lethal

1353
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,119
capabilities how are you going to

1354
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,760
explain to people what that does

1355
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,160
so there's a degree of

1356
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,880
uh complexity there involved but when we

1357
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,640
need to understand

1358
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
to what extent there is information out

1359
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,960
there about the capabilities of this

1360
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
weapon

1361
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,800
legitimacy is all about making sure that

1362
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,760
the actual use of data

1363
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,480
is in itself lawful and of course we're

1364
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,400
now talking of the laws of war

1365
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,079
and whatever derogations apply

1366
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,960
will also apply in this context but this

1367
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,119
is still part of the assessment that is

1368
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,200
undertaken

1369
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,760
purpose limitation what is the purpose

1370
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,359
of this

1371
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,599
not just the weapon what is the purpose

1372
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,880
of the facial recognition capability are

1373
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,440
we creating a database

1374
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,200
so that we can then

1375
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,599
share with our partners or are we just

1376
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,160
deploying that in order to

1377
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,839
take out a target

1378
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,079
what what is the purpose and it should

1379
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,599
be specified at the outset

1380
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,040
data minimization again a very tricky

1381
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
one to implement in practice we live in

1382
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,079
the world of big data

1383
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,960
the the more data that we have the

1384
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,359
better at the same time we have a

1385
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,000
principle which again is uni is pretty

1386
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,160
much universal to all data protection

1387
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
laws around the world saying well you

1388
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,480
should only be collecting the data that

1389
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,720
you need for that specified purpose that

1390
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,520
you you you have identified

1391
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,119
how do we know

1392
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,480
what is sufficient and what is too much

1393
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,559
well this assessment we will look into

1394
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,720
that

1395
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,200
accuracy well i guess this is the one

1396
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
that

1397
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,119
the the operational

1398
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,280
function is very much aligned with the

1399
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,280
legal assessment because we want to get

1400
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,760
it right we want to make sure that with

1401
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,599
the target we are

1402
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,440
chasing is the right target of course

1403
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,359
storage limitation all this data that is

1404
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,559
generated

1405
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,319
all this information all these

1406
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,359
by some megabytes of data

1407
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,359
where is it going to go

1408
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,280
where is it going to be kept for how

1409
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,880
long

1410
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
what is the exposure of this information

1411
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,760
will it end up on on the internet like

1412
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,800
in the case that you were talking about

1413
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,240
so

1414
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,960
retention and how and again the the

1415
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,040
period of retention the method of

1416
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,480
retention

1417
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,720
is essential

1418
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,400
rights

1419
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,280
well

1420
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,800
how do we deal with rights in this

1421
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
context

1422
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,640
a right that we have under data

1423
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,200
protection law is to understand

1424
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,720
what information is being collected

1425
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,240
about us

1426
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,040
and to have a say

1427
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,920
how does that impact in the context

1428
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,760
of a weapon

1429
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,800
again the limitations there of of the

1430
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,760
law of war will have a

1431
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,920
an important role to play but is

1432
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,280
something that we need to take into

1433
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,559
account

1434
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,800
particularly if the data that is being

1435
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,079
collected

1436
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,240
is data of civilians for example that

1437
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,079
are not involved at all

1438
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,119
in the military operations

1439
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,599
data security well

1440
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,000
this is cyclone so i guess i don't we

1441
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,440
don't have to say much about that but

1442
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,079
the importance of ensuring that all this

1443
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,760
information that is used and is

1444
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,599
collected is

1445
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,000
appropriately secure

1446
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,680
should have

1447
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,200
no

1448
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,640
uh sort of or deserve no no explanation

1449
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,119
and finally the one of the most

1450
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,480
interesting things i've learned at this

1451
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,040
conference over the past couple of days

1452
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,680
is the fact is that the the

1453
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,040
emphasis on international cooperation

1454
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,480
and

1455
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,720
it's interesting to see that again at

1456
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,040
the panel for example this morning about

1457
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,720
the uh the war in in ukraine how one of

1458
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,200
the key messages i i took

1459
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,400
from from that was the importance of

1460
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
international cooperation partnership

1461
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,839
well if the data is going to flow across

1462
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,040
borders

1463
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,520
sure that is necessary but how do we

1464
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,319
protect it against

1465
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,200
regimes that

1466
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,559
may not be allied or

1467
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,880
maybe neutral but are they involved in

1468
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,200
some way are they on our side are they

1469
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,480
on the other side

1470
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,280
so the international data flows are a

1471
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,079
key aspect so i finish by saying that

1472
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,240
this is a tool that already exists it's

1473
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,760
a tool that can be let's say adapted

1474
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,160
to the theater of war

1475
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,720
and it's a it's a tool

1476
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,520
that

1477
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,280
if used

1478
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,480
sensibly

1479
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,400
and practically

1480
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,720
it will be very useful probably to all

1481
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,839
of you thank you very much

1482
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,520
thank you so much eduardo i i think um

1483
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,760
i it was yesterday um where the

1484
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,520
president of estonia spoke and one of

1485
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,200
the examples the president of estonia

1486
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,160
gave was the move of data uh of

1487
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,920
ukrainian data to the cloud which

1488
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,599
required changes in ukrainian

1489
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,040
legislation

1490
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,440
and was done quite in a haste

1491
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,280
in part because of this of the security

1492
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,720
concerns relating to the russian

1493
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,599
invasion i think that is a perfect case

1494
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,440
study for thinking through data impact

1495
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,160
assessments and how we might be able to

1496
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,800
engage them especially when we have

1497
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
shorter time constraints compared to say

1498
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,440
a full article 36 review it also brings

1499
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,200
a lot of questions for me about

1500
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,839
what is subject to an article 36 review

1501
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,680
in the first place in particular how do

1502
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,079
we define means and methods of warfare

1503
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,319
and how much as militaries engage in

1504
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
various ai activities and ai

1505
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,079
applications how much should be

1506
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,400
subjected to these sorts of reviews that

1507
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,240
could potentially incorporate some of

1508
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,520
these practices

1509
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,000
very very very interesting stuff i wrote

1510
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,200
a bunch of questions for each of our

1511
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,960
panelists but i'm not going to ask it

1512
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,200
until i see that there are no hands here

1513
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,040
so my hope is that there's a ton because

1514
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,520
this has been so interesting so we're

1515
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,200
going to take any question from the

1516
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,920
audience just raise your hand um we're

1517
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,000
gonna oh there's a bunch great love it

1518
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,760
so uh we're gonna do two at a time so in

1519
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,000
hello um

1520
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
is it switched on yeah now it is so i'll

1521
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,400
make use of my organizers privilege and

1522
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,839
i have a personal mic so

1523
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,559
whenever i wish

1524
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,440
this question mainly goes to eduardo and

1525
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,559
i agree with you on so many levels and

1526
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,799
have published a paper expressing

1527
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,720
similar but not quite the same ideas

1528
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,760
myself some two years ago i guess

1529
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,079
and i ran against some heavy practical

1530
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,000
issues

1531
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,359
namely

1532
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,960
in your view who and when should be

1533
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,079
responsible for integrating

1534
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,400
data protection impact assessments into

1535
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,119
weapons review and how should it be done

1536
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,359
uh in the procurement phase in the

1537
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,200
development phase of a specific

1538
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,520
technology is the company who develops

1539
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,799
these capabilities responsible is the

1540
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,200
military organization

1541
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
deploying them or

1542
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,960
buying them your views thank you so

1543
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,000
to we're going to just take two

1544
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,880
questions

1545
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,559
just to give more opportunities for it

1546
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,680
so we're going to move straight to

1547
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,240
dollars shortly

1548
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,839
hi thank you very much for all of this i

1549
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,520
have an interest in this so lieutenant

1550
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,280
colonel daria eastlake from the office

1551
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,200
of the judge advocate general for the

1552
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,839
canadian armed forces so that'll kind of

1553
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,640
already give you your my slant probably

1554
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,680
um so obviously not a member of the eu

1555
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,280
coming from canada

1556
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,480
i i'm going to read with interest if

1557
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
you're writing this out because i i go

1558
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,760
step by step by step and i think i'm

1559
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,119
just flagging

1560
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,280
a few observations to begin with because

1561
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,040
i'm not going to make assumptions that

1562
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,480
article 36

1563
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,160
is this is even going to apply um

1564
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,160
and part of it is also when i look at

1565
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,319
you know obviously who are parties to

1566
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,799
article 36 within additional protocol

1567
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,119
one of course not the united states and

1568
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,640
not israel

1569
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,520
but depending on how they view customary

1570
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,200
international law so that's a first

1571
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,520
aspect second of all it's our

1572
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,760
obligations as

1573
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,920
we interpret the state the applicable

1574
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,839
state interprets international law

1575
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,000
that's applicable to them

1576
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,839
so that's another area that i'm going to

1577
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,440
flag

1578
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,200
and then as i kind of continue through

1579
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,799
that

1580
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,280
you're also at this intersection of ihl

1581
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,760
and and then international human rights

1582
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,040
law

1583
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,960
which i think is always fascinating and

1584
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,559
contentious

1585
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,480
and then even in there

1586
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
international human rights law versus

1587
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,200
national human rights and we get into

1588
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,079
jurisdiction questions so if i was to

1589
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,680
put on a professor hat i think you know

1590
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,760
i would be looking at all of these

1591
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,480
potentially as stumbling blocks which

1592
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,960
are going to offer off ramps

1593
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,720
um and that's not what you're trying to

1594
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,760
achieve

1595
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,000
for buy-in so i guess my question to you

1596
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,119
is if i if i park it and say

1597
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,520
forget the law

1598
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,760
can you not approach this from a policy

1599
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,040
decision

1600
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,359
where um

1601
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,839
states or militaries or other

1602
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,319
organizations did you consider that from

1603
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,079
a policy perspective just from a

1604
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,839
cautious perspective that they might

1605
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,880
just want to take that similar approach

1606
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,480
with those principles without feeling

1607
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,839
that they're legally bound to do so um

1608
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:26,319
so i put that uh over to you thank you

1609
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,079
okay so i'll let me address those those

1610
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,760
two things in a sense they are related i

1611
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,640
think the the two questions

1612
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
first of all let me uh

1613
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,760
uh if i can use some of the terminology

1614
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,799
of

1615
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,960
of european data protection law and and

1616
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,680
the gdpr that may help understand the

1617
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,480
who and and how

1618
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,280
some of you maybe all of you know that

1619
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,720
european data protection law

1620
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,280
creates obligations that apply to two

1621
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,359
types of players let's say

1622
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,520
we have what we call controllers and we

1623
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,680
have what we call processors and the

1624
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,680
very simple way of understanding this

1625
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,240
the controller is the one that is

1626
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,960
actually making decisions about the data

1627
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,440
so this is the data that i'm collecting

1628
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,400
for this purpose and therefore i control

1629
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,000
the data and then the processor is in a

1630
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,720
very very um sort of simple way the

1631
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,760
service provider the the sometimes the

1632
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,960
vendor sometimes the third party that is

1633
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,799
let's say helping

1634
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,920
that controller achieve its purpose

1635
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
data protection impact assessments and i

1636
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
think this is also very relevant in the

1637
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,040
context of article 36

1638
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,079
would apply to the controller

1639
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,000
it is the controller

1640
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,079
that is subject to the law the question

1641
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,079
is what if

1642
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,200
there is

1643
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
a controller let's say

1644
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,920
the military of a given country

1645
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,119
that is

1646
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,799
asking

1647
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,160
a vendor

1648
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,240
to develop

1649
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,480
a particular weapon who's

1650
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,319
and i think that

1651
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,880
the in my my interpretation of the law

1652
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,839
would be

1653
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,599
that in principle

1654
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,599
the law applies to the controller so

1655
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,880
again

1656
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,760
the the government of that country that

1657
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,720
is intending to use the data and they

1658
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,880
are the ones that are effectively going

1659
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,240
to employ and deploy but of course

1660
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,400
the vendor and again we see this in the

1661
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,799
in the not in a military context in

1662
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,480
every single other contract a vendor

1663
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,440
that is

1664
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,040
necessarily

1665
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,079
developing a particular use of data will

1666
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,280
have to bear in mind

1667
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,440
that the functionality of that

1668
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,640
particular again use of data or weapon

1669
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,599
complies with the law so

1670
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,319
the law may apply to one but it is

1671
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,480
actually the developer of that

1672
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,760
particular

1673
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,559
use of data that will imprison in

1674
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,680
practice quite often be subject to it if

1675
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,839
that makes sense

1676
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,240
um if i can address the other question

1677
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,119
about um whether

1678
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,280
uh it's uh sort of uh from

1679
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,280
as a matter of policy the thing about

1680
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,559
policy

1681
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,160
is that

1682
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,920
um

1683
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,400
as i said is subject

1684
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,079
to

1685
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,880
the political aims perhaps of a

1686
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,839
government or a

1687
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,920
group of institutions like the european

1688
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,680
union for example or the european

1689
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,559
commission and therefore is

1690
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,520
more

1691
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,240
uh subject to change

1692
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,480
or is not subject to

1693
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,319
uh influence

1694
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,200
than than the law is the law at the end

1695
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,240
of the day

1696
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,119
is only subject to the true influence of

1697
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,240
the courts

1698
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,280
because i'm a lawyer but i'm not going

1699
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,079
to and i may interpret the law but

1700
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,920
ultimately it will be the it'll be a

1701
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,920
court not even a regulator but the court

1702
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,240
that interprets this is how the law

1703
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,640
actually functions from a policy is

1704
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,720
something that i guess you have a little

1705
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,799
bit more room for of of maneuver if you

1706
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,920
want

1707
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,920
but um the question is uh

1708
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,240
in my view to what extent if the law

1709
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,200
doesn't apply

1710
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,799
whether you may feel or again a

1711
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,280
particular country may feel

1712
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,400
um

1713
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,079
morally bound

1714
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,520
to the to to apply a particular policy

1715
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,079
in order to achieve a purpose

1716
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,799
but

1717
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,680
as a lawyer that's outside my

1718
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,000
outside my roommate

1719
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,319
as best i'm curious specifically about

1720
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,559
this policy point if you could elaborate

1721
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,640
a little more about what drove germany

1722
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,480
in the example you gave

1723
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,079
to extend

1724
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,160
the the gdpr in this context to a

1725
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,359
domestic legislation uh absolutely um

1726
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,520
first i wanted to like support one thing

1727
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,520
with regard to ants regard um the

1728
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,119
question when and how to incorporate

1729
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,200
these kind of considerations into the

1730
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,559
development or the procurements of

1731
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,200
weapons i would say obviously if we can

1732
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,119
if if the state already indicates that

1733
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,319
he will only

1734
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,280
be interested in tools or weapons that

1735
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,319
that

1736
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,599
pay attention to this kind of

1737
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,920
consideration then uh companies will be

1738
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,440
bound to include them at a very first

1739
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,720
stage and that

1740
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,160
is something that is basically not

1741
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,079
happening right now in germany as i see

1742
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,880
because we're developing uh tools

1743
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,599
let's call it tools or weapons and

1744
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,960
we don't um

1745
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,400
companies do not pay attention whether

1746
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,960
or not we would be legally able to use

1747
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,599
um but uh coming back to the point i

1748
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,760
mean we actually to jump from your point

1749
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,839
asaf is the fact that

1750
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,200
we consider this as a pretty important

1751
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,799
right right data protection something

1752
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,960
very important so we decided that we do

1753
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,119
not want to have a regime

1754
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,960
that is consists of different kind of

1755
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,960
loopholes so

1756
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,359
military operations or like the legal

1757
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,440
affairs of the people actually serving

1758
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,520
in the military being them soldiers or

1759
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,200
civilians

1760
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,880
should be governed under one regime

1761
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,559
right and we found these kind of

1762
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,720
considerations in the gdp are all the

1763
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,599
things that eduardo laid out here on on

1764
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,039
his slides

1765
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,079
as universal right so i would always

1766
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,799
always opt for one legal regime covering

1767
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,599
it all providing special subsections for

1768
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,400
certain for different circumstances and

1769
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,039
um so far i have the feeling we fared

1770
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,200
well with this it's not very well known

1771
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,799
i found out in my own country that

1772
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,200
people are quite surprised that we have

1773
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,520
two distinct provisions in our law code

1774
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,240
addressing this um but who knows maybe

1775
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,319
that will uh down the road will maybe

1776
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,960
serve as a role model so

1777
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,839
that anything for you

1778
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,720
i think the question real really quickly

1779
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,558
i think as you're both speaking

1780
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,359
uh a mapping project a mapping mapping

1781
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,760
initiative needs to be done uh i just

1782
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,000
started in a little bit to really see

1783
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,200
beyond germany which countries have

1784
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,599
included these sorts of policy

1785
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,039
mechanisms which are the work around

1786
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,079
right because the law is going to take a

1787
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,480
lot longer so i know that the uk i don't

1788
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,760
know if anybody is here from the uk

1789
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,680
military but i know the uk military has

1790
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,680
a data protection policy on its website

1791
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,559
that's very gdpr-like how far down does

1792
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,319
it go probably not as far down as

1793
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,480
germany but that's one example i also

1794
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,480
checked for israel israel has absolutely

1795
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,599
nothing

1796
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,000
um no it's no surprise there but

1797
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,240
we'll probably need to so i just tipped

1798
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,000
really quick i think that's sort of a

1799
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,799
next step is to really map out where

1800
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,599
militaries are on this uh given

1801
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,200
uh materials that are already available

1802
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,520
any more questions

1803
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,880
the mic is coming around it's going

1804
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,400
around

1805
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,079
so over here in the front sorry

1806
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,319
thank you very much thanks for a

1807
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,480
fascinating panel from a policy

1808
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,960
perspective i can imagine and this is to

1809
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,480
all of you whoever wants to take it i

1810
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
can imagine that it could be in the

1811
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,119
interest of certain states not to

1812
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,359
harmonize legislation because it could

1813
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,680
be to their advantage that they are

1814
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,640
different

1815
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,240
legislation i mean if you think about

1816
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,480
this in terms of

1817
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,880
the use of different legislation when it

1818
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,559
comes to human rights in the war on

1819
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,640
terror for example this various states

1820
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,960
took advantage of this to be able to do

1821
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,079
things that were illegal in their

1822
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,440
country but were illegal in other

1823
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,960
countries right

1824
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,000
so i can imagine a policy reason why

1825
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,160
states would be reticent

1826
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,280
to harmonize this because they could use

1827
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,079
it to their advantage

1828
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,440
now i saw another hand right there

1829
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,359
thanks uh captain nick stark from the

1830
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,839
army cyber institute i really appreciate

1831
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,079
the conversation i can attest that at

1832
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,920
least one other small corner of one

1833
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,680
other military is thinking about this

1834
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,520
problem and the question that i would

1835
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,079
like to ask is

1836
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,839
maybe uh have a deeper conversation

1837
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,720
around what the military context means

1838
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,599
um

1839
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,160
so all the exam i think strava is a

1840
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,760
great example of this

1841
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,920
the military or a military did not

1842
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,119
collect that data absolutely the

1843
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,039
release of that data that decision was

1844
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,440
made entirely legally by a private

1845
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,599
company and yet had operational

1846
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,119
consequences

1847
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,920
as we think about the um

1848
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,520
application or assessments in the

1849
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,599
development of weapons we see this in

1850
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,000
ukraine right now the use of you know

1851
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,280
find my stolen ipod headphones being

1852
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,920
used in a military operational context

1853
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,720
the use of geolocation on tinder

1854
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,200
in a military operational context

1855
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,280
so essentially what is the military

1856
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,039
context when it comes to open source

1857
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,039
data and how do militaries protect

1858
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,440
themselves thanks i'd love to respond to

1859
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,559
that

1860
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,200
oh you're collecting no two are good

1861
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,640
you wanna

1862
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,720
i mean uh addressing your points i would

1863
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,559
say that is a question that comes to

1864
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,640
discipline of the kind of devices i'm

1865
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,640
using when i'm in the military right

1866
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,119
because the examples you brought was the

1867
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,960
usage of private

1868
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,759
tools websites whatever by servicemen

1869
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:18,560
right

1870
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,439
and

1871
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,479
this is what i mentioned about

1872
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,359
like raising awareness training them uh

1873
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,600
not to sit in the class two area uh

1874
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,920
writing what's up all the time or like

1875
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,238
getting rid of these when i'm jogging in

1876
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,399
background something like this yeah

1877
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,719
um

1878
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,279
so just my thoughts about this that this

1879
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,679
is a little bit of a um

1880
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,399
yes super important but um yeah the

1881
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,439
other thing that you have mentioned is

1882
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,040
actually yeah coming back to what mike

1883
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,359
schmidt says the interest uh in in the

1884
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,319
panel before us is the point that uh for

1885
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,238
some countries it might be interesting

1886
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,960
to be like out of this corner well i was

1887
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,319
talking about the european union right

1888
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,080
and i assume that we have a absolute

1889
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,839
shared interest and common understanding

1890
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,839
how we want to conduct all of our

1891
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,040
affairs down to our military operations

1892
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,359
whatever they will be in the future

1893
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,198
so i

1894
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,960
would like to believe that we can

1895
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,238
overcome this attitude

1896
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,238
i would love to get i

1897
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,479
love those comments so interesting

1898
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,198
because first of all that's my again it

1899
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,359
echoes what i what keeps me up at night

1900
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,600
i differ from you sebastian i don't

1901
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,640
think

1902
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,799
there's any way on planet earth to get

1903
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,080
human beings

1904
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,719
to not use their find my ipad app when

1905
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,319
even if they're in the middle of combat

1906
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,439
i it's it's not going to happen so those

1907
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,960
those

1908
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,520
multiple digital identities

1909
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,080
of competence are part of our lives and

1910
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,640
it's this is only going to become

1911
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,319
a more compounded problem as time goes

1912
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,839
on and the resolution the depth the

1913
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,238
depth of that personal data the haptics

1914
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,920
our dnas

1915
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,600
uh it's going to be part of whatever

1916
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,360
identity pods we have in the digital

1917
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,400
world and i think it's real so i i

1918
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,000
i'm in debt to you for bringing that up

1919
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,520
it's a great example

1920
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,640
um

1921
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,560
your first point is i think something

1922
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,719
that is uh worrying but can be dealt

1923
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,320
with that's the issue of military

1924
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,600
suppliers

1925
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,239
and vendors in your language eduardo and

1926
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,000
how the military is going to start

1927
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,360
regulating um

1928
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,280
in the first instance vendors that they

1929
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,199
officially work with so dod already does

1930
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,600
a lot of privacy uh

1931
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,640
and other requirements of their

1932
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,760
i just read 200 000 something suppliers

1933
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,920
on a regular basis a lot

1934
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,159
mark a market market

1935
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,760
determinative

1936
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,719
terminative uh supply situation so

1937
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,000
that's something that's got to be really

1938
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,640
red flagged and and looked at

1939
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,120
what do we do with uh

1940
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,280
third-party suppliers that are fallen

1941
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,560
part of the voluntary human activity of

1942
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,840
of competence and their families by the

1943
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,000
way um huge challenge so i'll leave it

1944
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,679
at that there is i wanted to throw one

1945
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,120
more thing out that connects with what

1946
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,719
you said eduardo evans i'm going to take

1947
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,440
advantage of this so there's a gdpr uh

1948
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,199
provision that's not

1949
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,920
yet a requirement

1950
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,520
on companies but it's called data

1951
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,760
protection by design and by default i

1952
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,000
know you can talk a lot about this so it

1953
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,080
imposes a require not even a requirement

1954
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,320
a suggestion a strong recommendation

1955
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,199
that anyone who's supplying a service or

1956
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,440
a product including military products i

1957
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,159
would assume to anyone in the european

1958
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,400
union needs to think hard again it's not

1959
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,080
quite a requirement

1960
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,159
have in the

1961
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,320
in the production of the

1962
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,840
supply of the service or the production

1963
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,120
of the product

1964
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,600
a sort of the

1965
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,239
pre-ready

1966
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,360
uh regulatory compliance with the gdpr

1967
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,199
how that's going to

1968
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,719
i think the commission has promised to

1969
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,000
develop the

1970
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,440
thinking around that and the enforcement

1971
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,040
around that in the coming years you can

1972
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,400
speak to that probably with a lot more

1973
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,840
depth but maybe that's something to hang

1974
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,360
our hat on

1975
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,360
yeah and just to other uh sort of let's

1976
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,199
say a legal technicality to your

1977
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,440
question which is fascinating is

1978
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,880
um

1979
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,920
so the scope of application of a law

1980
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,320
like the gdpr is determined by two

1981
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,880
things whether an entity is based in the

1982
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,400
eu or the uk for that matter

1983
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,199
or whether the use of data involves

1984
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,760
people in in the eu or the uk for that

1985
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,280
matter but

1986
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,880
so obviously the u.s the you you could

1987
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,679
say the u.s income the u.s any u.s

1988
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,320
company unless it's doing it uh in the

1989
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,120
eu it wouldn't be subject to it

1990
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,440
let's assume for a moment that

1991
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,040
we're talking of

1992
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,000
uh the military forces of an eu member

1993
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,960
state or again the uk

1994
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,040
you could there is an argument that that

1995
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,800
one could make that

1996
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
uh the um

1997
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,480
elements of national security are

1998
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,120
outside the scope of the gdpr okay let's

1999
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,560
not have that debate let's just assume

2000
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,440
for a moment that it does apply

2001
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,040
so in theory

2002
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,440
again under that assumption

2003
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,400
in the context of the use of

2004
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,520
on any type of technology whether it is

2005
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,120
it's not military technology but it's

2006
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,480
civil technology for military purposes

2007
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,440
that

2008
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,159
the army would be required to undertake

2009
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,960
a data protection impact assessment

2010
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,199
but here's the important point a data

2011
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,040
protection impact assessment

2012
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,320
is not

2013
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,199
a

2014
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,159
process to tell you that you cannot do

2015
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,239
something you see what i mean it's a

2016
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,840
it's a process to tell you how you can

2017
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,400
do something in a way that is compliant

2018
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,679
and in applying that uh that that

2019
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,040
approach

2020
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,199
i what i always say to my own team when

2021
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,840
we advise our clients is

2022
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
we need to remember data protection law

2023
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,679
is not in conflict with common sense

2024
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,400
it's not in conflict with

2025
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,280
what is the right thing to do so i think

2026
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,000
one needs to ensure that when applying

2027
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,320
the law no matter how technical

2028
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,239
the issues are you do apply

2029
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,440
particularly in the context of a data

2030
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,440
protection impact assessment through the

2031
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,640
filter of what is the right thing what

2032
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,640
is the right aim and what is

2033
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,640
what common sense common sense dictates

2034
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
um so i have i

2035
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,640
will take some more questions i do want

2036
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,480
to throw in one more thing to think

2037
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,960
about um when i was working for privacy

2038
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,920
international we applied and grant were

2039
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,920
granted a foia request

2040
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,920
that was the first to release some of

2041
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,000
the uk usa agreements around the five

2042
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,360
eyes arrangement

2043
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,760
um and these are arrangements from 950s

2044
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,480
1960s a very old document

2045
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,480
predates gdpr

2046
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,719
and yet some of the language of that

2047
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,480
agreement that i encourage all of you to

2048
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,760
go back to it

2049
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,640
uses data protection language

2050
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,600
about

2051
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,520
the way intelligence sharing is done in

2052
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,440
the context of these operations around

2053
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
originate a rule that is when i share

2054
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,600
information with you i have final say

2055
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,800
when you want to share it with third

2056
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,400
parties um a lot of kind of tidbits of

2057
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,159
kind of early day data protection

2058
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,760
standards have been incorporated into

2059
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,679
the yokoza and the reason why i'm

2060
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,679
interested in that is because as i think

2061
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,120
about where we are now if you had

2062
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,560
suggested or we look at what each

2063
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,719
country does so publicly and so on i

2064
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,560
think that a lot of the answer to the

2065
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,520
puzzle

2066
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,560
is hidden in bilateral so status of

2067
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,000
forces agreements

2068
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,159
and i think that there's a lot to ask

2069
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,600
about that even for an international

2070
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,199
lawyer who's really interested in the

2071
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,080
hardcore secret treaties how they apply

2072
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,800
what their meaning is

2073
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,280
what do we do when the treaty revokes a

2074
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,880
lot of protections that might exist

2075
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,480
under domestic law

2076
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,280
does the treaty is the contract void do

2077
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,280
we avoid it for public policy reasons i

2078
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,960
think there's a lot to think about there

2079
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,159
the intersectionality of contract

2080
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,719
secretaries sofas and in this context

2081
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,080
just a thought that occurred to me in

2082
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,719
the course of our discussions um

2083
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,320
any more questions from the audience

2084
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,840
okay terrific over there

2085
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,760
thank you uh by the pipers i i'm a uh

2086
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,600
on the one hand a lawyer but i'm also a

2087
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,320
military so i'm a bit uh

2088
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,960
two sides to this to this issue

2089
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,480
um

2090
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,080
in the netherlands

2091
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,199
this is a

2092
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,560
huge issue really really a huge issue

2093
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,480
especially in the in the military in the

2094
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,199
armed forces

2095
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,199
and i think and i agree with the captain

2096
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,679
there the military aspect is somewhat

2097
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,880
underexposed here

2098
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,280
you spoke a lot about ihl etc but the

2099
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,679
problem really is

2100
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,520
how do you train

2101
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,679
how do you prepare

2102
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,840
for an operation

2103
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,320
in the context of cyber most cyber

2104
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,880
operations are below the threshold the

2105
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,719
ihl does not apply to that situation

2106
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:55,679
so

2107
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,560
yes when we have the ihl when we have an

2108
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,159
operation

2109
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,840
chapter 7 etc etc then it's all

2110
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,600
fairly clear

2111
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,400
but

2112
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,440
how about training how about preparing

2113
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,040
for

2114
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,679
our situation sebastian is similar to to

2115
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,640
germany we have a specific netherlands

2116
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,400
dutch law

2117
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
the the implementation act

2118
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,760
which says there are two exemptions in

2119
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,280
the gdpr that's fine they don't apply to

2120
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,000
us

2121
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,480
we revoke them so the armed forces

2122
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,040
need to comply with the gdpr

2123
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,199
period

2124
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,239
also

2125
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,120
outside of eu law

2126
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,120
so when the military army goes to mali

2127
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,280
we need to comply in full with gdpr

2128
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,800
there's an exception to the exemption

2129
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,320
where our

2130
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,719
minister may say

2131
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,880
now wait a minute this is a specific

2132
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,679
situation i have the discretionary

2133
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,120
authority to say in this case it's you

2134
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,360
don't have to apply to it and the second

2135
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,840
one is we have a national intelligence

2136
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,400
act if it falls under the intelligence

2137
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,400
act then then it does apply

2138
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,520
so

2139
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,520
the question for me to you is do you

2140
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,840
have any advice

2141
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,600
on how we can

2142
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,960
train

2143
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,080
how we can create a level of readiness

2144
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,800
to prepare for activities during an

2145
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,400
operation

2146
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,520
how to

2147
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,640
i mean

2148
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,600
to process data

2149
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,679
an anecdote if i

2150
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,239
as as a full colonel in the netherlands

2151
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,080
if i type

2152
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,159
what is the name of the president of

2153
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,679
russia

2154
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,600
and i get a name

2155
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
and i process in my computer

2156
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,800
that's against the law

2157
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,320
that's very interesting i think it's

2158
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,000
time for a disclosure that i wrote my

2159
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,920
article with two of your countrymen

2160
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,159
together right so this is how i came up

2161
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,080
to that information but i i think the

2162
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,840
answer is pretty simple even if we are

2163
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,320
operating bill under under the

2164
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,719
threshold of ihl which is most of the

2165
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,360
conflicts uh we have around the world

2166
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,280
then we can just train the people of

2167
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,280
applying general international law human

2168
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,679
rights law as we understand incorporates

2169
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,000
uh provisions for pertaining to data

2170
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,080
protection and the rights to privacy and

2171
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,800
if we talk about tailor-made uh military

2172
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,640
training for example for european union

2173
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,840
missions well most of them anyway uh

2174
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,679
operate under the threshold we just

2175
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,760
mentioned then um that would be even

2176
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,159
better to um either have this kind of

2177
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,320
decision that we are asking for in our

2178
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,080
article or to

2179
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,640
use the um

2180
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,520
the uh reasonings and rationales behind

2181
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,239
a gdpr anyway because as we understood

2182
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,080
as us have mentioned even even

2183
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,159
provisions very very old they have the

2184
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,320
same kind of rationality the kind of

2185
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,120
principles eduardo put out here they're

2186
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,880
let's say like pretty much universal

2187
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,400
even if we look at

2188
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,719
uh deborah said like i don't know i

2189
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,239
forgot the number how many different

2190
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,239
different legal data protection regimes

2191
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,600
they're all more or less similar so i

2192
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
think that's a great starting point to

2193
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,760
start training and exercising and making

2194
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,679
people aware that these things needs to

2195
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,600
need to be considered and this is

2196
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,760
basically what we're trying to do at a

2197
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,440
ccdcoe

2198
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,280
um not shy away from this kind of

2199
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,679
unclear legal questions but put

2200
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:26,880
something out there and that at least

2201
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,639
something to consider right so you heard

2202
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,199
about this when when the when the um

2203
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,760
when the real case comes around so can i

2204
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,120
push back on that

2205
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,910
i'm going to

2206
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:38,320
[Laughter]

2207
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,440
we're sitting in a room in

2208
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,159
smack dab at the middle of gdpr

2209
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,360
home ground

2210
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,159
there's a big world out there and in the

2211
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,719
uh in the immediate context of the tens

2212
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,199
of countries surrounding this room

2213
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,520
um people know what the gdpr is they're

2214
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,199
acquainted with it is in fact the gold

2215
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,120
standard

2216
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,679
outside of that circle it's a whole

2217
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,000
different context and

2218
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,920
even i've even i'm not an expert in

2219
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,600
chinese law by any stretch of the

2220
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,480
imagination but i've read the chinese

2221
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
chinese data protection law which has

2222
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,040
really done a cut and paste of a lot of

2223
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,480
gdpr

2224
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,840
protections that we're familiar with the

2225
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,679
right to have information corrected and

2226
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,679
to know that there's algorithms working

2227
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,639
by the scene so in the chinese english

2228
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,480
translation of the chinese data

2229
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,120
protection law same list

2230
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,760
the legal regime backing

2231
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,159
behind that same list is obviously a

2232
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,560
very very different legal regime

2233
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,199
underlying privacy protections my point

2234
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,040
is just that we need to

2235
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,800
my sense is that we need to be much more

2236
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,880
sensitive and aware of the fact that

2237
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,320
there is not a you know vanilla flavored

2238
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,840
gdpr

2239
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,760
uh i'm advisor of the gdpr i think it's

2240
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,159
elegant regulation

2241
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,280
it's certainly not the global standard

2242
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,280
and as uh

2243
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,360
military operations or even militaries

2244
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,239
or that encounter each other uh on in

2245
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,880
the field of combat need to

2246
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,840
take into account each other's regimes

2247
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,400
i would really um i would really

2248
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,920
encourage us to open our eyes and i'm

2249
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,600
also you know i'm also at fault i think

2250
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
that uh

2251
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,440
just the assumption that these are their

2252
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,360
basics of date international data

2253
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,880
protection that are adopted by national

2254
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,600
laws is not going to get us as far as we

2255
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,520
think it will so that's that would be my

2256
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,360
pushback well i have to say i was not

2257
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,040
planning on training with the chinese

2258
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,800
you know so let's

2259
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,480
i was pertaining to other many other

2260
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,960
countries i don't know why not

2261
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,280
i don't know why not sebastian not

2262
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,000
chinese are not my neighbor

2263
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,199
but the thing is

2264
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,719
definitely looking at some of the

2265
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,320
internal data protection

2266
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,120
regulation putting out there by um

2267
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
international organizations

2268
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,920
they have been modeled after the gdpr

2269
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,520
with the idea hey then at least we can

2270
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,159
get rid of that legal obstacles so

2271
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,400
i guess we we should never prepare for

2272
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,639
the panel beforehand so we have not so

2273
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,320
much for

2274
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,000
no this is the good part but i stand

2275
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,840
with my opinion so let's say like this

2276
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,520
okay

2277
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,199
can i say very briefly i mean the

2278
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,840
question you're asking is a question

2279
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,679
i've been given for nearly 30 years in

2280
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,280
the sense that it's a question of how do

2281
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,600
i comply would i prepare for compliance

2282
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,920
and before the gdpr we had all the other

2283
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,719
laws

2284
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,199
and i think

2285
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,000
irrespective of size irrespective of

2286
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,760
framework in a way

2287
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,719
that

2288
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,440
is a three-step process as i said one is

2289
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,400
to identify the priorities so of all the

2290
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,360
legal obligations that may apply to you

2291
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,199
and the gdpr if you count all the

2292
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,040
possible legal obligations and the under

2293
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,760
the gdp at about 40 or 45. okay of those

2294
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,840
45 what are the top three what are the

2295
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,639
top five and identify the priorities

2296
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:53,920
second step

2297
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,760
have a plan how do you address those

2298
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,760
priorities and that plan is going to

2299
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,080
look like well we need a policy for this

2300
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,320
we need a protocol for that we need to

2301
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,360
uh

2302
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,080
deploy a contract that will cover this a

2303
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,719
security measure for that so that's a

2304
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,440
plan and then the third um thing which i

2305
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,760
think is very much uh you you already

2306
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,880
have it in your head is creating some

2307
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,840
kind of awareness strategy amongst those

2308
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,480
people within your organization that are

2309
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,880
going to be using this information

2310
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,960
because ultimately and this is this will

2311
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,639
be very familiar to all of you involved

2312
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,239
in cyber security the human um

2313
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,159
factor is in a sense the weakest link

2314
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,000
you can have all the perfect policies

2315
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,159
the perfect contract but

2316
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,560
the awareness of the individuals that

2317
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,600
are in contact with that information

2318
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,520
is critical and therefore those three

2319
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,000
elements the priorities the plan and the

2320
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,080
awareness are essentially the building

2321
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,159
blocks of what a compliance program will

2322
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,120
look like

2323
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,360
we are exactly three minutes we'll do a

2324
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,560
really fast

2325
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,239
question there we go

2326
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,840
okay so i should have given the caveat

2327
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,080
earlier not a lawyer i'm coming from the

2328
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,320
technical or operational background so

2329
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,639
i'd like to ask what happens when human

2330
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,159
rights principles are brought into

2331
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,120
tension

2332
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,520
so we've thought about you know securing

2333
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,520
or protecting individual soldiers

2334
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,040
privacy in an operational context and

2335
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,639
an example would be like technically

2336
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,400
interdicting third party tracking on on

2337
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,480
networks that we own and one of the

2338
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,239
pushbacks that we got from lawyers was

2339
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,800
well that implicates free speech access

2340
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,520
to data um these kinds of other

2341
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,719
principles so it's not so easy to say

2342
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,159
that like well

2343
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,880
you know this is all unmitigated good in

2344
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,960
some cases these um principles are

2345
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,560
brought into tension so i was wondering

2346
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,239
if you could uh

2347
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,880
maybe address that or get your thoughts

2348
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,920
thanks

2349
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,280
in two minutes and 20 seconds

2350
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,400
really quick

2351
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,239
you guys need to be in be in touch with

2352
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,239
uh with meta

2353
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,239
and its internal advisory board they've

2354
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,140
got it covered

2355
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,480
[Laughter]

2356
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,840
all these conflicts i know it's

2357
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
incredibly complex and

2358
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,440
good for your lawyers for having noted

2359
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,679
it we don't we don't know yet

2360
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,440
we don't know yet it's

2361
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,559
decisions need to be made

2362
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,239
the one thing i would add though is that

2363
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,440
ihl

2364
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,320
by design was meant in part to engage in

2365
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,560
some of these balancing acts and so

2366
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,320
military necessity

2367
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,440
security operational um necessities

2368
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,760
vis-a-vis humanitarian considerations

2369
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,960
human rights to the extent that they

2370
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,960
apply i think that there's

2371
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,719
partially why we're having the book

2372
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,639
while we're having these discussions

2373
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,400
is because we haven't had all these

2374
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,480
people come together and start a

2375
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,800
conversation together technologies data

2376
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,080
protection officers um ihl professionals

2377
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,080
intelligence professionals and i think

2378
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,760
that what you're seeing is that when we

2379
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,199
come in a room together and start having

2380
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,880
these conversations we often just

2381
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,120
introduce a lot more complexity

2382
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,440
but that's part of the fun in a way

2383
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,080
all right that is my cue to end so we're

2384
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,920
gonna first please join in

2385
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,920
congratulating this amazing panel that

2386
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,239
we just witnessed
