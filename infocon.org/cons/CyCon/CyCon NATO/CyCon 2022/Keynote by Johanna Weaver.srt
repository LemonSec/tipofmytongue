1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:01,599
so

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,560
a russian and an australian walked into

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
an irish bar in new york

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,559
it sounds like the start of a bad joke

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,519
but in actual fact it was my life about

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,519
a year ago

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,600
i had been released from fortress

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
australia where we were in lockdown

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
during covert and been given special

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
permission to travel to new york

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
where i was meeting with ambassador

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
andre krutzky

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,479
putin's special advisor for

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,399
international cooperation on icts

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,040
we would choose we'd chosen to meet at

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
mcsorley's irish bar for those of you

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
who know new york you'll know this

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,239
claims to be one of the oldest longest

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,800
established bars in new york

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,440
and the reason that i chose mcsorley's

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
was because somebody had told me that it

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,399
only served two types of drinks

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,680
light beer

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
and dark beer

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,159
no vodka in sight

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
this was a strategic self-preservation

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,040
decision on my own behalf

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
for those of you who know andre krutzke

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
you'll understand that

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
and we were there to talk about

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
two sets of cyber negotiations

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
we are i arrived first and ensconced

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
myself in a table and andre arrived

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,119
after me

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,000
and insisted that we moved to a table on

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,159
the other side of the room

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
presumably because he assumed that i had

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
arrived early to bug the table as

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
opposed to that i had arrived early

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
because i wanted to try and mix all

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,520
these hot dogs

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
but in any event we moved and we sat

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
underneath a sign that said be good or

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
be gone

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
and we decided that this sign would

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,960
become the most the motto for the

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,560
negotiations that we were about to

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
conclude

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
the two sets of negotiations was the gge

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,159
which was initiated by the united states

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,800
25 governmental experts

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
and the other set of negotiations was

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,879
the open-ended working group initiated

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,160
by russia

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
for 193 countries

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
now for those of you who follow

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
international law and norms closely when

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
it comes to cyberspace you'll recognize

59
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
the gge as being the foundational group

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
that agreed that international law

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
applies to cyberspace back in 2013 and

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,680
then in 2015 agreed 11 norms of

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
responsible state behavior now i know

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
many people have questions about the

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
efficacy of these high level agreements

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
and norms and i'll come to that later in

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
my presentation

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
but for the moment i wanted to emphasize

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
the significance of these two agreements

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
particularly to everybody here in the

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
room today

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,040
like all

73
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,519
multi-multinational multilateral

74
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,920
negotiations it requires grit and hard

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,800
work which sometimes happens over beer

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,159
and hot dogs

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
but it also requires a certain

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
serendipity

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
you need to have the sun the moon and

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
the stars of geopolitics and

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
multilateral negotiations align

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
right at that moment when you're

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
concluding your negotiation

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
and what was quite extraordinary about

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
the two sets of negotiations that we

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
were doing is that we managed to have

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,920
the sun the moon and the stars align

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
twice within two months

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
so with the oewg this was the group that

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
russia had initiated 193 countries

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
and russia had broke the negotiations

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,080
out from the small group format into

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
this large group format

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
now that wasn't because russia suddenly

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
decided it wanted to be inclusive and

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
democratic it was because we feared that

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
russia was trying to rewrite what had

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
been previously negotiated over two

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
decades with

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
within the gge

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,920
to try and rewrite the international

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
rules-based order in cyberspace if you

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,040
like somewhat of a common theme that we

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
are hearing in other domains as well

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
what we achieved within the oewg was not

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
substantive progress

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
but we did whilst negotiating with 193

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,759
countries

109
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,720
managed to reaffirm the two decades

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
worth of agreements that had been made

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
in the small group format

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
and that really was a significant

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
diplomatic feat due in no small part to

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,479
the gentleman

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
who is pictured here ambassador lauber

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,120
the swiss chair of that that process

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
so with the russian process concluded

118
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,000
all eyes then turned to the gge

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
and this is a picture of uh ambassador

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
patriotta who was gaveling in the final

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
report of the gge

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
much to the relief of everybody uh

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
joining virtually or not virtually it

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,759
was a strange set of hybrid negotiations

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
the gge

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,639
we

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,039
we managed to conclude this negotiation

128
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
notwithstanding that the russian process

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
had finished two months earlier there

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
was a lot of angst about whether russia

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
would hold up its end of the bargain and

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,479
also play ball with the us-led gge

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
and in part this was what i was talking

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
about about serendipity so in may and

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,919
june 2021 there was a de taunt in u.s

136
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
and russian relations that frankly if

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
you blinked you would have missed it and

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,160
it's a dayton that i don't think we will

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
see again for a long time given russia's

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
invasion of ukraine

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
but putin and biden were due to meet in

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,919
june and that allowed us to apply

143
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,759
pressure in the gge

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
and we had two significant outcomes in

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,039
the gge the first was

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
substantive guidance on how to implement

147
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
the 11 norms of responsible state

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
behavior so we went from sort of one

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
sentence norms to multiple paragraphs of

150
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
explanation

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
and we also agreed that existing

152
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
international humanitarian law applies

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
to state conduct in cyberspace

154
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
this is the first time that this has

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
been explicitly recognized in a un

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
document

157
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,560
this is one of my favorite photos of the

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
negotiations i call it the gigi brady

159
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
bunch it's the photo that we took

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
immediately after the

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
report was gaveled in

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
the paragraph on international

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
humanitarian law was the last paragraph

164
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,759
to be agreed the report itself was

165
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,919
certainly no fader complete the gge in

166
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,759
2017 had failed after years of

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,639
negotiation

168
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
the paragraph on ihl was particularly

169
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
difficult but we managed to conclude it

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,840
by doing some diplomatic dancing with

171
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
the language

172
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
i think it's interesting here that for

173
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,639
china to get china across the line we

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,599
needed to include explicit recognition

175
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
to say that just because we were

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
referring to international humanitarian

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
law we weren't encouraging the

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
militarization of cyberspace

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
that's what it took to get china across

180
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
the line

181
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
to get russia across the line we needed

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
to put two things into the document

183
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
the first was that russia required us to

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
say that ihl only applies during armed

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
conflict

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
now to all of the lawyers in the room

187
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,199
that's sort of a self-evident truth that

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
ihl only applies during armed conflict

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
i think the fact that russia required

190
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
this to be inserted in the agreement is

191
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,599
telling of russia's concern about its

192
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,160
gray zone activities

193
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
the other thing that russia required to

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,039
have inserted was a sentence saying that

195
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,160
um i we need to have further study on

196
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
the application of how international law

197
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
applies

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
and the point i'd like to emphasize here

199
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
is that just because it requires further

200
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
study does not diminish the fact that we

201
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
have agreed that existing that that

202
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
international humanitarian law applies

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
china has agreed this russia has agreed

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
this the us has agreed this the 25

205
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
experts agreed this and every country at

206
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
the united nations endorsed this in

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,440
december 2021

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,479
now

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
if you know me well enough

210
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
the next question that i get asked is

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
well done johanna great negotiation good

212
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,839
outcome but who

213
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,360
cares because

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
we're talking about something that our

215
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
adversaries won't necessarily abide by

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
themselves

217
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
this is a question that i get all the

218
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,399
time

219
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
why do we agree norms and law if it

220
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,279
constrains our militaries our operators

221
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
if it's not constraining our adversaries

222
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
and i would say to this that is a

223
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,279
fundamental misunderstanding of the way

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
un negotiations work when i negotiate at

225
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
the un i don't negotiate and then turn

226
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
around and say hey guys at the

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
australian defense force with the

228
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
australian signals directorate guess

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
what i just agreed that international

230
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
humanitarian law applies to cyberspace

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
now you guys need to apply it

232
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
that's not how negotiations work

233
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
the way that every negotiation that has

234
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
articulated responsible state behavior

235
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,080
in cyberspace is the exact opposite

236
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
we take something that our countries are

237
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
already doing

238
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,560
and we say we want this to be the

239
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,120
international standard we want to embed

240
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
this in the international rules-based

241
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,640
order

242
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
and so

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
when we say international humanitarian

244
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
law applies

245
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,720
the australian

246
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
adf already applies

247
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
international humanitarian law to our

248
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
cyber operations

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
this is not an additional constraint

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
and so the message that i'd like to make

251
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
for everybody here

252
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
sorry the second point on this that i'd

253
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
like to make is around

254
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
the the question of well if the rules

255
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
are made but then the rules are

256
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
broken what's the point of them

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
we've seen russia violate the u.n

258
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
charter by invading ukraine

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
we have seen russia violate the geneva

260
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
conventions by targeting

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
indiscriminately civilians in maripol

262
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,680
and elsewhere in ukraine

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
but just because russia is breaching the

264
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,760
u.n charter is breaching the geneva

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
conventions

266
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
does not negate the value

267
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
of the un charter and the geneva

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
conventions

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
the reason we agree these rules is

270
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
because we agree a standard to hold

271
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
countries accountable to

272
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
and so just as there is condemnation and

273
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
consequences for russia's behavior

274
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,399
in the physical domain in ukraine

275
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,600
i urge everybody here especially the

276
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,839
lawyers in the room but also the

277
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,120
operators

278
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
when we're talking about what what

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
russia is doing in ukraine

280
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,079
please also be asking the question does

281
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,399
this violate international humanitarian

282
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,279
law

283
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
i know there are many people who would

284
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,079
say we haven't yet reached that

285
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,880
threshold when we've been talking at the

286
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
examples that were given by the keynote

287
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
speakers before me would indicate that

288
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,240
perhaps there are some instances that do

289
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,800
regardless of if it does or doesn't the

290
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,959
point is we now need to be asking the

291
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,560
question

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
because as australian lieutenant general

293
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
morrison once said the standard that you

294
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
walk past is the standard that you

295
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,839
accept

296
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
and we have now accepted the standard

297
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
that international humanitarian law

298
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
applies in cyberspace

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
the message is simple

300
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
missiles or malware

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
international humanitarian law applies

302
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
and i call on everyone in this room to

303
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,120
help us to uphold that

304
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
and this really leads me to the second

305
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,200
part of my speech

306
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
and this is

307
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,279
the the response by nato

308
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,000
to the russian invasion in ukraine has

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
largely been framed

310
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,720
as a

311
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,200
response to defending the international

312
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
rules-based order

313
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,200
about values and democracy

314
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
now i have spent 10 years of my career

315
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
as a diplomat which i am no longer i've

316
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,320
joined academia but i spent 10 years of

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
my career avoiding talking about the

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,079
international rules-based order values

319
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,440
and democracy

320
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,720
in rooms full of military types or cyber

321
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,279
operators because if i did i knew that

322
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
you would inevitably have a series of

323
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
eye rolls

324
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
and so i'd just like to pause briefly

325
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,959
for a moment

326
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
and acknowledge the significance that we

327
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,200
now have military commanders

328
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
standing up talking about the defense of

329
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
the international rules-based order

330
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,439
and democracy and freedom

331
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,720
in the 10 years that i've been working

332
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
in this space i have learned some hard

333
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,000
lessons about the way that we talk about

334
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
the international rules based order

335
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
largely by engaging with countries

336
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,560
outside of the nato sphere of influence

337
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
i've learned this through trial and

338
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
error that there are certain things that

339
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,760
we say

340
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
that really annoy the countries that are

341
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
on the uh that are not within our

342
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
like-minded group of countries

343
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
and so i offer the following five hard

344
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,320
truths for us and i offer them because

345
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
as domestic national policymakers are

346
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,639
starting to talk about the international

347
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
rules based order more as our militaries

348
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,240
are starting to talk about it more

349
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
we don't have time for people to make

350
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,399
the same mistakes that diplomats have

351
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
been making for the last five to ten

352
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
years and so i offer them in the hope

353
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
that you can take them on board and

354
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
leapfrog

355
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,920
the first hard truth

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
is so evident that i almost didn't put

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
it in but then i put it back in

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
and that is

359
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
that if we had to renegotiate the

360
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
current re the current rules-based

361
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
international order

362
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,000
we couldn't negotiate it

363
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
liberal western democracies do not hold

364
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
the balance of power

365
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
and the difference between the

366
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
international rules based order or the

367
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
point of the international rules-based

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
order is that might is not right

369
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
numbers matter

370
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,040
and when you actually look at the

371
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
numbers this is from the economic

372
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,880
intelligence units democracy index

373
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
full democracies

374
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,279
21

375
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,760
full authoritarian regimes

376
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,079
59

377
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
the countries in the middle about a

378
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,639
hundred in the middle are classified as

379
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
either flawed democracies or hybrid

380
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
regimes

381
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
and it's those hundred countries in the

382
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
middle

383
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
that will make or break

384
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
whether or not we are successful in

385
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,800
defending the international rules-based

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
order

387
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
we need to

388
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,720
actually sell the existing international

389
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
rules-based order to that hundred

390
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,720
countries in the middle

391
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
not to ourselves

392
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
we've already drunk the kool-aid

393
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,880
we need to sell it to the hundred

394
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
countries in the middle

395
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
because the current international

396
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,120
rules-based order is ours to lose

397
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
and we won't get it back if we lose it

398
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
so how do we get it back

399
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,600
well for a majority of countries the

400
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
value of the international rules-based

401
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,440
order isn't democracy and freedoms

402
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,399
it's stability

403
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,399
when i speak to the hundred countries in

404
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,680
the middle

405
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
without fail every time they say to me

406
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
we're not interested in great power

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
games

408
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,680
we're not interested in russia and china

409
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
and being a pawn in what's going on

410
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,160
between them and the eu and the us

411
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
what we care about is our independence

412
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,279
our economies and our development

413
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
and actually we're meeting here in

414
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,559
tallinn and i think the estonian case is

415
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
an excellent example of this

416
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,039
estonia declared independence in 1918.

417
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
at the start of the second world war

418
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,720
estonia declared neutrality

419
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,280
germany russia said we don't really care

420
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
that you've declared neutrality we're

421
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,720
going to declare you part of the russian

422
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
sphere of influence

423
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,319
and suddenly

424
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
a lot of young men boys really in

425
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,679
estonia found themselves conscripted

426
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,320
into the red army

427
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,039
and then the war continued

428
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
germany and russia had a falling out

429
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
declared war on each other

430
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
and germany

431
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
occupied estonia

432
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
and many of those same boys

433
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,120
were now forced to wear a german uniform

434
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
and then as the conflict progressed

435
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,720
many of them subsequently wore a version

436
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
of an allied uniform

437
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,039
if you have asked any of those estonian

438
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
boys or young men

439
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
or most of them in any event what it was

440
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
that they were fighting for

441
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,919
it didn't matter to them whether it was

442
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,760
the red army the german army or the

443
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
allies

444
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
they were fighting for an independent

445
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
estonia

446
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
and i can speak about this relatively

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,559
authoritatively because my grandfather

448
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
was one of those boys

449
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
and this is a picture of him

450
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
as he was honorably discharged from the

451
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
allied forces

452
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
in 1948 and then he moved to australia

453
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
where he had a family of which i am the

454
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
product

455
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,919
now of course we hope that we're not in

456
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,000
a situation where 100 countries in the

457
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
middle are required or forced to choose

458
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
by putting on different military

459
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
uniforms

460
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
we all hope that we don't get to that

461
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
point

462
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
but i think there are many countries the

463
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
hundred in the middle that would really

464
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,720
resonate with that sentiment of

465
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
what we care about is our independence

466
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,120
our economy and our development

467
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,720
and so when we talk about the

468
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
rules-based international order

469
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
rather than talking about the

470
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,799
rules-based international order as

471
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
promoting liberal democracies

472
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
when actually the point of the rules

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
based international order is to allow

474
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
different types of governments to

475
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,600
coexist peacefully

476
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
so let's instead emphasize and talk

477
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,840
about this existing rules-based order

478
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,400
providing the stability for countries to

479
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
determine their own future

480
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,280
and if you do that rather than talking

481
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
about liberal democracy and alienating

482
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,799
half the world

483
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
if we talk about the power to determine

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,280
your own future you will suddenly find a

485
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
lot more countries rallying behind the

486
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
existing rules-based international order

487
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
so what does all this have to do with

488
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,559
cyberspace

489
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,360
well the third hard truth that i offer

490
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,200
here is that nato's lack of transparency

491
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,919
around military operations

492
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,799
erodes the mission of defending the

493
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
rules-based international order

494
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
i want to make a few

495
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
important clarifying points here

496
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
i'm talking about cyber operations in

497
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,360
support of military operations

498
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,559
which as uh both general nakasone and

499
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,280
president caris have just said are now a

500
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,639
fundamental feature of modern conflict

501
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,919
just like the details of any military

502
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,880
operation i'm not suggesting that

503
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,200
transparency means there is no

504
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,799
classification

505
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
of course

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,440
the details and the specifics of tools

507
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,919
and means and methods need to be

508
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,640
protected

509
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,039
but we do need

510
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,679
to talk about the fact that we have

511
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
these tools

512
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
and that we use them in accordance with

513
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
the international rules based order

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
i really want to be clear about this

515
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
point this is not about the moral high

516
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
ground

517
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,159
this is about saying there is no longer

518
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,880
a strategic benefit to keeping these

519
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
tools in the dark

520
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,679
there is a strategic benefit by being

521
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
more transparent about what we're doing

522
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
and there is no military disadvantage to

523
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
being more transparent

524
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
continuing in the means that we do at

525
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
the moment is an own goal in two

526
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
different ways

527
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
firstly from a strategic perspective

528
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
russia and china despite all evidence to

529
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,440
the country

530
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
continue to insist that they have not

531
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,039
developed offensive cyber weapons for

532
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,840
use in the military context

533
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
i have witnessed firsthand how powerful

534
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
it is to stand on the floor of the

535
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,919
united nations and say australia

536
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
develops offensive cyber capabilities

537
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,240
we use these capabilities in support of

538
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,480
military operations

539
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
but we use them in accordance with

540
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
international law

541
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
and the norms that have been agreed at

542
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,760
the united nations

543
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
this points out russian and chinese

544
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,600
hypocrisy to the hundred in the middle

545
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
without us having to say a word against

546
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
russia and china

547
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,159
and that level of transparency really

548
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
makes a difference

549
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
and the second point that i would make

550
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,039
is it's an own goal to continue to keep

551
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,480
these operations

552
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
in the dark

553
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
because nato complies with the existing

554
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
law and norms

555
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,280
and in my my view it's disrespectful to

556
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
the nato cyber operators

557
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
who are conducting these operations to

558
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
continue to do so

559
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
in the dark implying that they're doing

560
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
something nefarious

561
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
as opposed to that they are conducting

562
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,240
operations that we can all stand behind

563
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,200
and be proud of

564
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
so what i'm saying here is i want to

565
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,039
repeat this is not about sigint

566
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
it is not saying no classification it's

567
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,960
saying

568
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
public acknowledgement of the

569
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
capabilities associated with a statement

570
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,919
that we use them in accordance with

571
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
international humanitarian law

572
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
international law and the norms and it

573
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
was really notable to me that in general

574
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,640
nakasone's remarks just now

575
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,400
that he referred to the use of the

576
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
capabilities but there was no mention of

577
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,080
international law

578
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
and in doing so that leaves a hundred

579
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
countries in the middle concerned

580
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
they're concerned about how these tools

581
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,919
are being used and i know because i've

582
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,640
witnessed it from the inside that we use

583
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
these tools responsibly

584
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,840
it's an own goal

585
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
and this really links to the fourth hard

586
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
truth that i make which is that if we

587
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
want to defend the international

588
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
rules-based order we have to

589
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,799
consistently demonstrate

590
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,279
that we respect it

591
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,080
nato declared cyber

592
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
the fifth domain of operations back in

593
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,039
2016.

594
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
and if we did a straw poll of the

595
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
hundred countries in the middle and said

596
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,080
does nato comply with the international

597
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,200
rules based order law and norms

598
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
in air sea and

599
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
air sea and land

600
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
for the most part most countries most of

601
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,880
the time would say yes

602
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
nato has a really good reputation

603
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
of doing the right thing sometimes doing

604
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
the hard thing but doing it in

605
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
accordance with the rules based order

606
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
that we're upholding

607
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
if you asked that same question of the

608
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,720
hundred countries in the middle of cyber

609
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,080
you would get a very different response

610
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,279
and that is because in part of the lack

611
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,880
of transparency that i was just

612
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
referring to

613
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
but also because of a conflation

614
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,720
of sigint operations intelligence and

615
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,640
military operations

616
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,559
or cyber operations in support of

617
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
military

618
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,360
and so to everybody here today

619
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
i would say for all of you that you is

620
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
within your power

621
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
to encourage your military forces

622
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
to be more transparent about the fact

623
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,799
that you have these tools and every time

624
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,360
you talk about them no matter how high

625
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
level

626
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,120
please be also reiterating the point

627
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
that you use them in accordance with

628
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
international law and norms

629
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
we need to normalize the way we talk

630
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,600
about cyber operations just like we talk

631
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
about other operations

632
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
this will really go a long way in

633
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,080
reassuring countries that the existing

634
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
international rules based order is an

635
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,799
order that they should be defending

636
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
rather than an alternative that is being

637
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,960
offered by russia and china

638
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,679
and this leads me to my final point

639
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,799
which is my hard truth number five and

640
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,919
this is really goes back to that common

641
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,799
criticism of why agree these things if

642
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,279
it doesn't uh if it restrains us but not

643
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,159
our adversaries

644
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,279
i spent three years of my life

645
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,880
a year and a half of which was

646
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
negotiating generally in the middle of

647
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
the night in australia the un

648
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
negotiations started at 11 p.m

649
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,120
australian time through to 6 a.m

650
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
i worked

651
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
most weekends

652
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,240
and traveled extensively speaking to

653
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
countries all around the world

654
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,320
i don't say this for the glory i say it

655
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,799
to make the point that no one is more

656
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,000
passionate

657
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,960
or proud of what we achieved out of the

658
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,120
oewg and the gge

659
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,200
particularly with respect to ihl

660
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
but i am also painfully aware that it is

661
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
not enough

662
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,399
if we are going to meaningfully have

663
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,960
restraint in cyberspace rather than

664
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,480
articulate responsible state behavior

665
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
then we need to fix the verification

666
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
conundrum

667
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,200
and what i mean by this is there is no

668
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
existing cyber power

669
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
that will give up

670
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,080
or agree to a restraint on that cyber

671
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,279
power

672
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,480
until

673
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
they can verify that their adversary

674
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,840
will also

675
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
respect

676
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
that exercise of restraint to put it

677
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,559
bluntly

678
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,880
australia wouldn't agree

679
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,840
about not to not pre-position on other

680
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
countries critical infrastructure if we

681
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,919
can't verify that china and russia are

682
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,720
not going to do the same thing

683
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,520
and so i say to everyone here so much of

684
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
the focus of our work is on things like

685
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
cyber security and cyber defense

686
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,919
we really need to also focus on how we

687
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
fix and solve the verification conundrum

688
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
because if we genuinely want to move

689
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,600
forward in un negotiations and start

690
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,679
negotiating restraint of cyber power

691
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,360
which would be to the benefit of all of

692
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
our national security

693
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,000
we can't do that until we fix the

694
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
verification conundrum

695
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
i'm quite sure that with the extensive

696
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,679
brain power in this room we can do that

697
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
it's not easy

698
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,960
but we can

699
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,679
and that will be the key to unlocking

700
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,880
meaningful progress in discussions and

701
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
also to driving peace and stability in

702
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
the context of cyberspace and as we all

703
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,240
know what happens in cyberspace doesn't

704
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
stay in cyberspace

705
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,000
i really want to thank the nato ccdcoe

706
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,320
for inviting me here to speak

707
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,960
it's an honor to be in a room full of

708
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
i've been told there's around 500 people

709
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
here which is amazing i haven't been in

710
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
a room full of 500 people in a really

711
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,679
long time

712
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,120
i also

713
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,080

714
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
honor it is to speak after general

715
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,880
nakasone and president karas in

716
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
particular i think the second would make

717
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
my grandfather very very proud

718
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
i hope that this conversation starts

719
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
many more interesting conversations and

720
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,000
