00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,640
nagasoni ladies and gentlemen but also

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,879
colleagues and friends i'm indeed

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,639
delighted to be back here in tallinn and

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,040
to be here on this stage at icon for the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,160
first time

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
it's a flagship conference for a very

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,519
complex issue

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,880
and it's been a while since we've been

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,400
together in person

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,640
yet here we are again today grappling

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
with the persistent challenges but also

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
the unparalleled opportunities of

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
cyberspace and emerging and disruptive

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
technologies that it enables

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
i'm grateful to be part of this strong

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
cyber community of which estonia plays a

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
pivotal role

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
you lead by example

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
you are never afraid to think outside of

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,160
the box

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,559
and you support those that need our help

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,280
you inspire us as a truly digitized

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,399
nation

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,520
and we're grateful for your

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
contributions to nato and what's up's

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
contribution is as the host of the

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,079
cooperative cyber defense center of

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,879
excellence here in tallinn

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,239
the ccdcoe is a curator of knowledge of

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,719
expertise and of ideas

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,879
and these ideas underpin the nato

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,000
alliance

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
they support the very notion that we can

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
achieve more when we work together

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
as the threat landscape develops and as

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
technology advances

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
when we keep moving together

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
one thing remains constant and that is

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
our values

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
of europe and north america standing

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,240
together and united in a shared mission

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,960
to defend one billion people living in

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,799
our allied nations

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
to defend them in the physical world but

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
also in the digital world

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
now and in the future

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
this conference comes at an

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
unprecedented time

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,119
we face a profoundly changed security

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,560
environment

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
and cyberspace has been central to the

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
war in ukraine

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
it has been used to shape the battle

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,119
space

56
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
cyber attacks were used to lay the

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
ground for the invasion

58
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
to disable ukrainian communications and

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
the ability for the government to

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,000
communicate with its people

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
but also to distort the narrative

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
through this information

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,920
in recent months we've seen cyber

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
attacks with data wiping malware

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,239
continue to target ukrainian entities in

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,120
government commercial and energy sectors

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
to paralyze computer systems

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
some of this malware has had cascading

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
impacts beyond ukraine's borders

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
the heck on the

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
satellite network for example affected

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
internet connectivity for tens of

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
thousands of people across europe

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,160
many nato allies including estonia have

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
attributed this attack to russia

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
condemning the attack in the strongest

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
terms

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
in recent weeks we saw filled attempts

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
to disrupt the ukrainian power grid

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
which could have left millions of people

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
in the dark

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
and in recent days we've seen further

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
warnings from our governments against

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
potential cyber attacks against critical

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,080
infrastructure in response to support

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,400
provided to ukraine and the sanctions

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
against russia

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
protecting and securing cyberspace is

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
not something any one nation

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,480
any one alliance

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
any one continent can do alone

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
which is why an alliance like nato and

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,319
its partnership network across the globe

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,040
are so vital during this critical moment

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,760
for our shared security

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
today i'd like to reflect on three main

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
teams

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
first on the strategic importance of

99
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
cyber for current and future conflicts

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
then second on what we're doing and what

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
more we need to do to respond to the

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
change security environment

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
and third and lastly on the role of

104
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
cyberspace and the emerging and

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,760
disruptive technologies that it enables

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
in the new strategic concept for nato

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
and beyond that time

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
so for some initial observations on the

109
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
strategic importance of cyber for

110
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,560
current and future conflicts

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
it's important to see cyberspace for

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
what it is it is a contested space

113
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,280
and unlike other domains it is always on

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
there's constant friction and continuous

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,879
activity

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
a blurring of the lines between peace

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
crisis and conflict as already mentioned

118
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,080
by the general

119
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
these unique characteristics challenge

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
traditional thinking on the terrace

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,238
it is not possible to prevent and deter

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
all cyber activities so we have to shift

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,040
our thinking towards a more proactive

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
approach

125
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,639
we must understand that cyberspace is a

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
means to achieve strategic effects

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
the skill of the pre-kinetic destructive

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
cyber operations that took place in

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,199
ukraine was unprecedented

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
initial observations suggest that cyber

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,919
means can achieve effects not

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
necessarily in the form of shock on all

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,960
events but through more insidious and

134
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,440
persistent campaigns

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
as russia's invasion of ukraine began

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
the importance of cyber as an enabler

137
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
and a complement to traditional kinetic

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
war became apparent

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
but it's also a domain where effects can

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
be achieved in their own right and we

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
need to think about it this way

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
finally cyberspace is a shared space

143
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
with many actors not just governments

144
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
during the war in ukraine we've seen the

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
private sector take a critical role in

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
defending against cyber attacks

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
while we have been talking about public

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,400
private partnerships for years already

149
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,880
the events of the last month truly have

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
seen a new level of engagement between

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,160
public and private sectors to advance

152
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
international peace and security

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
so an initial takeaway from the war in

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
ukraine is that cyberspace is an area of

155
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
strategic competition and conflict

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
between states

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
and that cyberspace can only be defended

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,680
and secured in a collaborative spirit

159
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
so with that let me turn to the second

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,919
theme how nato is responding to this

161
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
change security environment and what

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
more i believe we should consider doing

163
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
about it

164
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,000
allies have recognized cyber defense is

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
part of nato's core task of collective

166
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
defense

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
and in line with nato's defensive

168
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
mandate they are determined to employ

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
the full range of capabilities at all

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
times to actively deter defend against

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
and to counter the full spectrum of

172
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
cyber threats

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
and if necessary allies will impose

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,759
costs on those who harm them

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
allies are also making greater use of

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
nato as a platform for political

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
consultations

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
they are sharing information and

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,720
concerns exchanging national approaches

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
as well as considering possible

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
collective responses

182
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
and this became evident once again when

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
senior cyber coordinators from nato

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,919
allies came together for a first special

185
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
meeting at the north atlantic council

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
two weeks ago

187
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
allies there discussed how the alliance

188
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
has cyber capabilities and defenses

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
should evolve and how to enhance our

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
collective posture in response to recent

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
developments in the cyber threat

192
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
landscape

193
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,479
to support these collective efforts

194
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
allies are bolstering their national

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
resilience in the face of potential

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,800
cyber incidents targeting especially now

197
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,880
critical infrastructure

198
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
through nato cyber defense pledge we see

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
continued investments in national

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
strategies capabilities and skills

201
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
and looking beyond borders working

202
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
closely with nightminded partners and

203
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,039
organizations including the european

204
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
union is another key pillar of our

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
approach

206
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
we are enhancing consultations with

207
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,880
finland and sweden whilst also working

208
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
closely with partner nations such as

209
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
ukraine georgia japan australia and new

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
zealand

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
there are rules that govern cyberspace

212
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,520
and we need to uphold them together

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,759
looking ahead there are a few areas

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
where i believe there's a need for

215
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,879
further action

216
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
the first is very much embodied in the

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
spirit of forests such as this and

218
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,440
bodies like the ccdcoe

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
and i'm talking here about partnerships

220
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
as was already mentioned by previous

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,080
speakers

222
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
partnerships that span civilian and

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
military fields public and private

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
sectors and national and international

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
spheres

226
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
defending our values and the rules-based

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
international order is a collective

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,280
effort

229
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
and so too is building capacity and

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
helping others to shore up their

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
defenses

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
a second area that requires attention in

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
my mind focuses in particular on

234
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
engagement across public and private

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
sectors

236
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
i mentioned at the outset

237
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
the important role that many private

238
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
sector actors are playing in ukraine to

239
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,679
respond to incidents share information

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,640
ensure backups of data and keep systems

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,719
up and running

242
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
this engagement is remarkable and it

243
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
needs to be further embedded within our

244
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
longer term approach to tackling

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
persistent malicious cyber activities

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
and campaigns

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
related to this is the notion of

248
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,040
resilience

249
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
the fundamentals haven't changed but our

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
efforts must intensify

251
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
we've placed a priority on this at nato

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
and allies are also doing their part

253
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
while cyber defense remains the

254
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,800
responsibility of each ally nato is a

255
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
platform where allies are helping each

256
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
other raise their overall level of

257
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
resilience

258
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,680
more broadly as allies address ways to

259
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
strengthen nato's longer-term deterrence

260
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
and defense posture it is clear that

261
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,920
cyber defense will play a key role in

262
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,959
this

263
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,519
so to sum up nato's approach to cyber

264
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,760
defense is multi-faceted

265
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,519
while we have achieved much in recent

266
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,080
years there is much more that we need to

267
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
bolster our defenses in the long term

268
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
with that as promised let me turn to the

269
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
future

270
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
cyberspace and the emerging and

271
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
disruptive technologies it enables will

272
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
be at the core of strategic competition

273
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
between states

274
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
technologies such as ai autonomous

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
systems big data biotech and quantum are

276
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
changing the world and our everyday

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
lives

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
they're also changing the way the

279
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
alliance operates they provide us with

280
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
new opportunities for our militaries

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
helping them to become more effective

282
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
resilient and sustainable

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,440
but they also represent on the other

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
side new threats

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
and that is why nato and its allies have

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
placed the priority on fostering and

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
protecting our technological edge

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
allies recognize that new technologies

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
will form the backbone of our deterrence

290
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
and defense posture and are taking steps

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
to stay ahead

292
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
and this is being done through some new

293
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
initiatives

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
such as the defense innovation

295
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
accelerator for the north atlantic or in

296
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,560
short diana which will foster our

297
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
transatlantic innovation ecosystem for

298
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,839
defence and security purposes

299
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
and through the nato innovation fund a

300
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,160
multinationally funded effort to provide

301
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
venture financing to cutting-edge

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
startups that are developing to use

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
technologies

304
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
these initiatives will also enable us to

305
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
advance our work in specific technology

306
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
areas such as implementing nato's first

307
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
ai strategy that was adopted last autumn

308
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
to this end we're also looking at a

309
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,680
strategic implication of iaiai for our

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
cyber defenses

311
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
for example ai can support the defending

312
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
side by allowing better detection and

313
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
response to cyber attacks

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
but at the same time the same ai can

315
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
also enable malicious actors to skill

316
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,440
and refine their attacks and make them

317
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
more difficult to be detected

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
we're also looking at early-stage

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
innovations such as quantum computing

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
research shows that quantum computers

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
will be capable of breaking much of the

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
cryptography that currently secures our

323
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,440
digital communications on the internet

324
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
and that's not in the too far future so

325
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
in an era of strategic competition and

326
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,959
conflict maintaining and sharpening our

327
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
technological edge will be a decisive

328
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
element as we stand together to protect

329
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
our citizens and also our values

330
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,399
and nato will continue to do its part to

331
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,079
ensure the responsible use of these

332
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
technologies and the cyberspace is free

333
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
open and secure

334
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
ladies and gentlemen international

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
stability has been challenged in the

336
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
recent months

337
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
peace on the european continent has been

338
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,519
fundamentally shattered

339
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
there is war on a skill and of a nature

340
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
that we saw belong to history

341
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
and this war has demonstrated the

342
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
strategic importance of cyber for

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
current and for future conflicts

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
we recognize the contested nature of

345
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,040
cyberspace

346
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
and we recognize the need to develop

347
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
multifaceted responses across civilian

348
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
military public and private national and

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
international spheres as part of a

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
collective effort

351
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
and we also recognize that while

352
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
progress have been made to strengthen

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
our collective cyber resilience there's

354
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
much more to be done

355
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
we can't stand still

356
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
we must continue to harness cyberspace

357
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
and emerging and disruptive technologies

358
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
it enables for our long-term defense and

359
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
deterrence

360
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
later this month nato leaders will

361
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
gather in madrid to agree on a new

362
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
strategic concept for the alliance

363
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
this is our blueprint for keeping our 1

364
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
billion people safe in the decade to

365
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
come

366
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
this pivotal moment requires our

367
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
collective resolve to secure the future

368
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
of democracy the future principles and

369
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
our values

370
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
these values are the most precious

371
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
assets of nato alliance

372
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
we're united in defending them now and

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
in the future and also in cyberspace

374
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,550
thank you

375
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:40,480
[Applause]

384
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,279
thank you um

385
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
just as a there's been a lot of emphasis

386
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
on public-private partnership as the

387
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
general discussed uh from the

388
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
perspective of nato and nato partners

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
what exactly could the private sector do

390
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
or isn't doing at this time that could

391
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
further enable your mission and sort of

392
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
help in a critical time where we have

393
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
entirely different priorities

394
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,279
yeah well say i think that what we're

395
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,959
seeing in the war in ukraine is not

396
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,760
completely new we always had our

397
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
cooperation with the private sector

398
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
whether it was in sharing indicators of

399
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,199
compromise

400
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,800
or or looking at possible mitigation of

401
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
zero their errors i think what ukraine

402
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
told us is that the private sector has

403
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
an insight into what's happening on

404
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,639
networks on the scale

405
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,199
that we at nato for example don't have

406
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,519
also in areas where we don't have any

407
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
jurisdiction ourselves and that the

408
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
private sector has capabilities

409
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
for example in moving the ukrainian

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,320
government administration to the cloud

411
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
that we as a collective sector

412
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,279
could never do in such a short time

413
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
so that that's what i mean by having to

414
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
rethink how we have this permanent

415
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
cooperation when it comes down to

416
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
sharing awareness information but also

417
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,040
looking at mitigation and support in

418
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,839
encountering ongoing threats

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
on a more structured skill

420
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,240
coming from the same values which as

421
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,040
we're seeing now uh is the case with our

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
tech companies as well who are more than

423
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
willing to uh to stand in uh to help uh

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,040
at no cost uh when it really matters

425
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
like now in ukraine so i can't tell you

426
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
when and where will come with very

427
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
concrete uh new ideas but i can tell you

428
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
that we're in the process of looking at

429
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
a more structured uh permanent

430
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
corporation in the realm of cyberspace

431
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
between nato and the private sector

432
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,079
thank you

433
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
thank you sir any more questions in the

434
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
audience

435
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,160
there is a hand up front here

436
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
thank you very much for joining us i

437
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
wonder if you could elaborate perhaps on

438
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
some of the newer initiatives undertaken

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
with partner nations of nato uh in the

440
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
cyber domain as we look at what's going

441
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,639
on in ukraine and the need for us to

442
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,839
work with new partners and

443
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,279
allies yeah i think ukraine has

444
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,720
underlined uh the importance of of of

445
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,000
cyber as a domain as i said uh but also

446
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
as a domain in itself

447
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
with clear impact for all sectors of

448
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,560
society

449
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
so what we notice is we've been helping

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
ukraine since 2014 in bolstering the

451
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,079
cyber defenses as an alliance but we now

452
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
notice that there are partners that are

453
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,800
probably at risk to some point

454
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
who are knocking on our door

455
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
to get that same kind of uh

456
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,360
support uh in bolstering their own cyber

457
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
defenses so in ukraine at the moment uh

458
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,120
uh

459
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
of course the main effort is on

460
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
countering the attacks that are ongoing

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,439
and there's not much useful thing that

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
nato can do there as an alliance per se

463
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,760
allies on a bilateral basis and the

464
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
private sector are assisting in that

465
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,039
ongoing

466
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
effort but for other partner nations

467
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,000
they're very much keen and eager to get

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,079
that kind of structural support that

469
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,799
raises the level of their resilience

470
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,240
and in the end we live in an

471
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,839
interconnected world

472
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
as was

473
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
said earlier in a speech so

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,720
the idea that partners will be affected

475
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
and that we wouldn't be that there

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,880
wouldn't be any spillover effects or any

477
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
secondary effects of major cyber

478
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
breaches of partner nations is an

479
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,559
illusion

480
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,760
if a a national network breaks down it

481
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
could lead to food shortages it could

482
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
lead to migration uh it could lead to

483
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
lawlessness uh uh in in in partner

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,039
countries bordering our alliance so

485
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,039
definitely cyber defense cyber security

486
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
is not something that stops

487
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
at the borders of the alliance but goes

488
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
well beyond

489
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,679
thank you sir i was pointed out there

490
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
was a hand in this general yes there is

491
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,160
a hand okay and after that we'll have

492
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
one more question so think ahead plan

493
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
when you talk about the civil sector and

494
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,919
the military sector or the nato sector

495
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,360
coming together

496
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
um how do you see

497
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,080
the convergence between what we see in

498
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
the civil sector represented in europe

499
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
by

500
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
legislation like the nist directive

501
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,880
where we have strong regimes already and

502
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,160
how do you

503
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
see them merging with your intentions of

504
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
addressing especially the critical

505
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
infrastructure sector from the nato side

506
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
yeah it's a good question so

507
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
i i mentioned the european union in my

508
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
in my speech as a very close partner

509
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
the benefit of the european union when

510
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
it comes down to this speech is that it

511
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
can actually provide legislation heart

512
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,679
law

513
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,600
the benefit of nato in this sphere is

514
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
that we can provide soft law

515
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
we can look only at the security and

516
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
defense implications

517
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,919
of certain interactions for example with

518
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
the private sector which you can then

519
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
feed into the law making process

520
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
uh on on the european uh but also on the

521
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
other side of the ocean

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
in order to make sure that any

523
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
legislation that's being

524
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
drawn up doesn't impede the security and

525
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
defense needs that we have for example

526
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
when it comes down to

527
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
sharing information in in crisis time so

528
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,360
the aim of this collaboration is indeed

529
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
to start this dialogue to have a more

530
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,919
closer interaction uh into for example

531
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,400
the benefits but also the limitations

532
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
of

533
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
legislation on data storage uh in in a

534
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
physical domain

535
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
and to give you an example that in

536
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
ukraine

537
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
moving

538
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
the government services to the cloud was

539
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,919
actually a protective measure that

540
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
required a change in legislation on the

541
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,600
ukrainian side

542
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
so

543
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
what might be very obvious from one

544
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
point of view looking through a lens of

545
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,919
privacy

546
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,840
might have limitations on the security

547
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,400
uh aspects or risks that we run

548
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
on the defense side and and this

549
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
interaction is what we need to take into

550
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
account so looking at the security

551
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
implication of all other choices that we

552
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
make whether it be in our economic

553
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,640
resilience

554
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
in our energy security dependencies but

555
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
also inside the domain

556
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
thank you sir and easter

557
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
there is lisa well there is two hands

558
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
we'll see how we're doing with time but

559
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
lisa was first yeah

560
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
good morning thanks lisa maybe we can

561
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,080
share i had just a quick question sort

562
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
of uh transparency and information

563
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
sharing i was wondering if you can if

564
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,480
you would like to share from your

565
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,960
perspective nato alliance current cyber

566
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
domain let's say last half a year did

567
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
you experience uh sort of attacks uh

568
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,120
what would be your description of

569
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,480
the last

570
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,799
particular is this last half a year of

571
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
cyber domain in the alliance what what

572
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,760
is the situation thank you

573
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
well thank you for the question now and

574
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
i'll answer us as far as i can uh

575
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
without going into any classified

576
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,240
information but i think the general

577
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,480
feeling is that although

578
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
we have seen some attacks on allies and

579
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
allied nation

580
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,640
that they were not

581
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,320
comparable to the size skill and

582
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,640
sophistication of the operations that

583
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
we've seen in ukraine

584
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
and and

585
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,559
anyone can draw their own conclusions on

586
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,360
why that is uh whether it is

587
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,679
russia trying to avoid coming into

588
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,799
direct confrontation with nato or they

589
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,960
simply have a focus

590
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
of their capacities in ukraine but

591
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
that's something that we've noticed

592
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
at the same time we've also noticed like

593
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
the cars attack that they've taken

594
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
deliberate choices

595
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
with which they knew

596
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
there would uh most certainly be

597
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
collateral damage

598
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,559
also in allied countries

599
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,919
so the cars attack which had

600
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,080
implications in in a number of allied

601
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
countries was something that they took

602
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,919
for granted so that's

603
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
some new behavior that we saw and of

604
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
course those secondary effects can be

605
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
just as detrimental uh as the first

606
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
order effects as we've seen with the

607
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,640
nonpatcher attack so there is a reason

608
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
for real caution

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
both

610
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
being prepared for direct attacks but

611
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
also for secondary uh

612
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,520
collateral damage

613
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
and i know i have no future in estonian

614
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
cyber community if i ignore lisa's

615
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,159
questions so lisa you got to have

616
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,000
and that makes you an officer react that

617
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
will have a long and bright future

618
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
anywhere in the world

619
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
my question deputy secretary general

620
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,200
speaks to the

621
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
capability planning paradox or the

622
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
dilemma of the allies

623
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
in this

624
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
skill

625
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
and competence shortage that we

626
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,240
inevitably live in

627
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
the allies you can understand would be

628
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
tempted to keep their best and brightest

629
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,039
at home to solve the pressing issues or

630
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,320
problems at home at the same time we do

631
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
we're all allies because we believe in

632
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,520
the

633
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
alliance in nato as a force multiplier

634
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
what do you think can either allies or

635
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
the airline alliance itself do more to

636
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,799
make sure that

637
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,600
we're all incentivized to collectively

638
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
deploy the best and brightest

639
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
but of course i would say that we

640
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
already have the best and the brightest

641
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
at nato

642
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
coming from your countries

643
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
but it is true that in a more sensitive

644
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
domains uh we really need to

645
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
uh

646
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
prove to individual allies that nato is

647
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
a force multiplier

648
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,480
we all get it when we speak about tanks

649
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,559
or aircraft or the nato command

650
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
structure

651
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
but where cyber came from uh at first

652
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
being used mostly in the intelligence

653
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
community uh uh and and being below the

654
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,240
radar uh we we see the same challenge as

655
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
we've seen but with special forces

656
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,679
that

657
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,320
there needs to be a high degree of trust

658
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,039
before we share the real information

659
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,200
that then make sure that we have that

660
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
for forced multiplier

661
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,120
there which would then incentivize

662
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
nations to make sure that nato is the

663
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,279
hub uh where you need to send your

664
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,520
brightest in order to get the most

665
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
benefit out from nato i think we've made

666
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
big steps since declaring cyber domain

667
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
in 2014

668
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
but more steps are to be made so working

669
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
on that trust

670
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
first of all our new cio is sitting here

671
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
on the front row working on the the

672
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
cyber security of our own networks which

673
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,919
is a baseline

674
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,000
requirement but at the same time

675
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
creating more uh

676
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,720
of a framework for sharing information

677
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
at a higher degree

678
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
of of of of

679
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
of of complexity uh will enable

680
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
nato to offer us the platform what it is

681
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,440
if

682
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,840
if nations don't bring to nato

683
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
uh their capabilities then it is just a

684
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
very big building in the middle of

685
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
brussels

686
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
so the power is

687
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
to

688
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
collectively combine those capabilities

689
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,520
train together so you can also operate

690
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,279
together when it's needed and cyber is

691
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,960
no different in that respect from any

692
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,799
other domain

693
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,320
sir you have handled challenging

694
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
questions exceptionally well is there a

695
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,120
burning question are we

696
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
we have the opportunity there is a

697
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
burning question sir you're gonna take

698
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,559
one more sure okay it's your coffee

699
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
uh sorry for standing in the way

700
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,880
uh very quick one uh you talked about

701
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,320
ppp

702
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
uh quite a lot uh

703
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,000
how do you see how to better draw a line

704
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,840
in terms of

705
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
what data and which tools uh to

706
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
use from the private sector

707
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,159
uh in the public cloud in the

708
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,760
uh sort of

709
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,799
the their realm and then give the power

710
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
of the hosting of those solutions to

711
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,320
them

712
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
and

713
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
which ones still to

714
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
uh to keep within uh nato's and uh

715
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,799
nation's military's uh

716
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,200
internal assets

717
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
that's a very big question and i could

718
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
talk for hours on the answer to that uh

719
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,799
but but in short what we've seen

720
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
especially with these new edts is that

721
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
the military is no longer leading in the

722
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
innovation sphere there

723
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
there's a tons of reasons for that

724
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,400
declining in r d budgets uh

725
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
the defense market being too small

726
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
uh the commercial market having become

727
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,760
very successful in in quickly scaling up

728
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
new technologies but the fact is there

729
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
that we are no longer leading

730
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
in areas like autonomy ai the use of big

731
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,360
data

732
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,559
so we need to

733
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,919
catch up

734
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
and catching up means recognizing that

735
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
this is mostly a civilian and private

736
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,679
sector led

737
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
in

738
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
endeavor

739
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
but that we need to be there with

740
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,919
initiatives to make sure that we're

741
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,399
early adapters to this technology

742
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,320
that we can make sure that the dual use

743
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,559
purposes of new technologies are being

744
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
built into new capabilities from the

745
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
beginning and i mentioned diana and the

746
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
nato innovation fund has two initiatives

747
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,120
to do just that uh we want to post

748
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,000
challenge ques challenging problems to

749
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
innovation ecosystems without

750
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
delineating what kind of capabilities

751
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,080
might be the answer what kind of

752
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
technology might be the answer and

753
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
thereby tapping into the enormous

754
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,039
innovation potential that we have in our

755
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,360
allied countries in order to be early

756
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
adapters and and i would say that in

757
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,279
most cases

758
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,880
we will strive for that to be a dual use

759
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
product so no longer a strict

760
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,480
delineation between military

761
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,159
prime companies

762
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
and civilian companies most of these

763
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,840
technologies will always have a dual use

764
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,520
and that's good because it also means

765
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
that there's a commercially viable

766
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,919
business case behind those technologies

767
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,559
and as we know the innovation cycles

768
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,200
in these technologies are so high

769
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,120
that our operational requirements

770
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,559
process would have a

771
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,399
difficulty in keeping up and being the

772
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,480
main incentivizer for that so work in

773
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,559
progress i would say

774
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,000
sir thank you for your leadership in

775
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
nato thank you for your continued

776
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
support to ccdcoe and cycon thank you so

777
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,640
much

778
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
thank you
