sector and this is me practicing my

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,439
check so

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,159
uh thank you for your patience

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,040
and his research he focuses on threat

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
doctors especially ransomware groups

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
which is also what he will be talking to

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
us about today

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
michael previously worked at

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
the czech ministry of defense and he has

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
been both a visiting scholar here at

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,800
nato ccdcoe and at the natos.com coe in

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
riga so we're very excited to have him

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
here

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
but first out martin the floor is yours

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,239
okay thank you

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,040
uh

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
okay

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
we got that right okay that's who i am

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,720
that's where i work that's what i'm

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
gonna be talking about

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
these are my caveats

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
okay don't have to put them up for very

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,440
long

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
and uh because the conference theme is

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
keep moving we'll go to slide number

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
three

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
okay so what motivates this discussion

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
we have what i would call standard

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
deterrence

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,440
and standard deterrence essentially

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,080
rests on three things one

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,159
you make some indication or declaration

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,840
of what you don't want the other side to

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
do

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
number two

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
if the other side does it

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
you have the responsibility of

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
determining

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
whether it crossed your red lines who

90
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
did it

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
and number three if you're going to

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
instantiate a deterrence policy as

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
opposed to just have it then you have to

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
meet out punishment

95
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,480
okay

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
standard deterrence one-on-one

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
does it work

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
and this is a big question but i'm gonna

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
say it doesn't seem to be working well

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,680
enough

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
the best example of coercion

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,159
in the service of improving cyberspace

103
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,360
was the agreement signed by presidents g

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
and obama in 2015 in which the chinese

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
agreed not to carry out certain forms of

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
cyber espionage

107
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
but the linchpin of that agreement

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
was not wonderful and good feelings

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
between the two presidents but the

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
implicit and not always implicit threat

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
that the united states would put

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
sanctions on chinese companies that

113
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
disobeyed

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
well the life span of that threat was

115
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
roughly equivalent to the remaining

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
lifespan of the obama administration

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
and a large reason in my humble opinion

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
not everybody agrees for that

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
was because the turns has an assurance

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
component it's not only if you do this

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
i'm going to do that to you but it's

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
also if you don't do this i'm not going

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
to do that to you and you had an

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,759
administration that had a much broader

125
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
set of complaints against china at which

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,759
point chinese said

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,000
damned if we do and damned if we don't

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
so we might as well go ahead and do okay

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
the other instance i would point out is

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
there was a specific warning from

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
president biden to president putin not

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
to go around hacking our infrastructure

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
and it's too soon to tell whether that

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
in fact reduced the amount of hacking

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
one of the things we know about

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
deterrence

137
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
is we always know when we can tell when

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
it fails but we can never tell when it

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
succeeds okay

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
part of the problem with standard

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
deterrence as we practice it where

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
attribution is an important element in

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,759
the game

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
is that it puts the burden of proof on

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
defenders

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
okay it forces us it forces those who

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
would deter

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
to

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,320
detect the the cyber attack characterize

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
it as a cyber attack

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
somehow make the argument that it

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
crossed the red line although u.s red

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,720
lines are not particularly precise and

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,199
then do attribution and then you have

155
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
the other side basically going what us

156
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,680
we are a law-abiding country what he

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
wouldn't even think of doing that and

158
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
that's sort of where it lands okay but

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
still the burden of proof is on the

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
defender

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
meanwhile if you were actually level

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,199
your punishment you can't go around

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,960
saying not us

164
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
that indictment of your hackers that

165
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
wasn't our country yeah like you know

166
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
okay it wasn't pennsylvania

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
okay now there are some people who make

168
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,919
the argument that the reason deterrence

169
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,240
has been disappointing is because we

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
haven't pressed hard enough

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
okay and if you look at the two forms of

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
punishment that have been used

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
since

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,319
roughly 2014 and going forward it's been

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
sanctions and it's been indictments

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
indictments could very well be

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
dissuasive word not for the small fact

178
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
that when we indict state actors they

179
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,639
almost never see the inside of a u.s

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
courtroom

181
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
as for sanctions are concerned

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
there is a a zero-sum game in sanctions

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
we cannot for instance

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
credibly threaten

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
not to trade with north korea because we

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
don't trade with them we can't do that

187
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
for iran because we don't trade with

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
them right and we're getting to the

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
point with russia that we can't credibly

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
sanction

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
russians for cyber attacks because we

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
are credibly sanctioning them for a lot

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,639
of other misbehavior that we like even

194
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
worse than their cyber attacks okay and

195
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,599
there's a final point is that we have

196
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
found that novelty

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
the fact that cyber attacks are often a

198
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
surprise not in how they got in

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
but why anyone would want to do

200
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,080
something else like that at all are

201
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
characteristics of a lot of cyber

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
attacks if you put together a bunch of

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
smart folks in 2015

204
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
as i was honored to be among those

205
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,120
you know me plus a bunch of smart folks

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,840
right and you try to list all the things

207
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
that were red lines for the united

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
states

209
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
nobody would have come up with it with a

210
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
hack on the dnc

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
okay if you're trying to explain

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
yourself why it is

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,319
that the

214
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
the solar winds attack somehow crossed

215
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,199
the red line you can tie yourself in

216
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
knots because cyber espionage is in fact

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
accepted state practice within certain

218
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
limits if you look at colonial pipeline

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,000
right is a problem that was a ransomware

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
attack it was a problem that colonial

221
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,759
pipeline decided to respond to an attack

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
on their business systems by closing

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,919
their operating their operating pipeline

224
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
okay so you have issues

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
so what i'm going to entertain

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
oops oh sorry

227
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
okay is something i call obnoxious

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
deterrence the word obnoxious is so you

229
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,680
can associate me with any particular

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
term here at the conference

231
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
okay and it works as follows

232
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,319
it starts off with one side carrying out

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,319
behavior you don't like

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
okay

235
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
uh

236
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,839
so you carry out cyberspace operations

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
which are seriously annoying and i'll

238
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
get to why it has to be seriously

239
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
annoying but short of armed conflict for

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,640
very obvious reasons okay and i've given

241
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
two examples

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
but that's because somebody asked me for

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
examples it's actually harder to give

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,519
out examples and defend them than it

245
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
looks like okay so we now start being

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
annoying to the other side because we

247
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
believe that they are doing things that

248
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
we find annoying

249
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
okay the other side

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
suitably annoyed starts asking for

251
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
negotiations whether they're public

252
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,040
informal private and informal tacit used

253
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,399
through signaling

254
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,480
is is it is a different matter but

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
anyhow there is some sort of give and

256
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
take

257
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,279
in which ultimately you end up with an

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,880
agreement be it formal be it tacit

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
because a lot of agreements from the

260
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
cold war for instance were tacit they

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
were never written down in which

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,320
both sides refrain from the behavior

263
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
that the other side finds particularly

264
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,120
annoying

265
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
okay and then we come for the last part

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
what if the other side sheets

267
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
right what if they go back and engage in

268
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
behavior that they don't like

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
well the solution is we engage in

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
behavior that they didn't like

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
right which is has a certain first of

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
all we don't necessarily have to explain

273
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
ourselves

274
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
and second of all

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
um

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,959
we don't necessarily have to force them

277
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,200
to predict what's coming because

278
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,680
inherent in the nature of that agreement

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
is a notion of what's coming

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
okay

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,519
now

282
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
at this point i'd like to thank cycon

283
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
for allowing me to introduce the concept

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
and now i'm going to spend the next two

285
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
slides shooting at it

286
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
let's prevent you folks from doing the

287
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
same okay

288
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
um sorry i'm a little behind on the

289
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,839
clicker

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
okay um

291
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
okay there's obnoxious deterrence the

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
obnoxious deterrence raises whoops

293
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,839
okay

294
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
let's go back

295
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,720
okay

296
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
compared to standard deterrence

297
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,519
obnoxious

298
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
deter oh

299
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
okay i was right the first time okay

300
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
obnoxious deterrence raises some issues

301
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,560
of its own

302
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
the first thing is it helps for it to be

303
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
a cyberspace operation now notice

304
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
that the u.s approach

305
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
to other people's cyberspace operations

306
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
we don't like involves something outside

307
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
of cyberspace

308
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
why should obnoxious deterrence involve

309
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,519
something inside cyberspace

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,560
okay

311
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
that depends on the kind of agreement

312
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
that you want to conclude

313
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
if what your agreement is i won't do x

314
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
if you don't do y

315
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
right that's an asymmetric agreement if

316
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
x and y are not the same

317
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
but there's an expectation in fact that

318
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
what you're basically saying is i won't

319
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
do x and y

320
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
and you don't do x and y

321
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
it's our x that you find annoying it's

322
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
your why that you that we find annoying

323
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
right and we put it together in a

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
package once you cross domains your

325
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
negotiations become a lot more difficult

326
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
because

327
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,320
the advantage of staying in the

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
cyberspace domains is it gets rid of a

329
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
lot of extraneous issues

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
once you cross domains you're into these

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,639
extraneous issues your negotiations

332
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,200
become far more difficult okay so that's

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
the first constraint number two

334
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
it needs to work

335
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
now

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
this is so obvious that i'm going to

337
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
have to explain why it's not obvious

338
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,399
right

339
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
if you do deterrence

340
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,399
and you threaten somebody with something

341
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,480
you've never done before

342
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
they have to believe that what you're

343
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,800
going to threaten with is in fact going

344
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
to work

345
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
so for instance

346
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,720
a nuclear deterrence policy

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
we are threatening people

348
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,040
heaven for fan with essentially

349
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
missiles that we haven't used in combat

350
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
right

351
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
there's a high degree of faith on the

352
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
other side that they're going to work

353
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,480
with obnoxious deterrence however you're

354
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
starting off with the behavior that's

355
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
the punishment

356
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,200
which means if you're going to be at all

357
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,320
impressive

358
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
the thing actually has to function and

359
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
in cyberspace that's not a guarantee

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
right it's one thing to say if you mess

361
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
with our electric grid we'll take down

362
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
yours it's quite another thing to be

363
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,320
able to do so with a high degree of

364
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
reliance with obnoxious deterrence

365
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,519
before you even have any deterrence

366
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,600
you've proven yourself capable of doing

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
a certain category of annoying things

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
okay

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
now number three and this one is

370
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
particular for cyberspace

371
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,240
and that is

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
it has to be

373
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
working as defenses arise

374
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
the cybers the medium of cyberspace is

375
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
one in which measure and counter measure

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
are continually competing against one

377
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,399
another

378
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,600
okay so you can expect that the other

379
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
side's first reaction is not going to be

380
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
to go to negotiation table but to use

381
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,279
internal measures

382
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
to cost effectively reduce the annoyance

383
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,199
level of your cyber operations so if

384
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
you're going to be effective you need a

385
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
set of cyber operations that don't

386
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
counter measure that easily okay

387
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,480
number four that's actually is obvious

388
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
enough i don't have to explain it it

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
needs to be annoying enough

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
it needs to be annoying enough

391
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
that countries start negotiating or at

392
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
least raising the issue at the state

393
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
level

394
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
okay a lot of things that we see in

395
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,639
cyberspace are annoying but not annoying

396
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,120
enough so there's a certain threshold of

397
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
annoyance that you have to meet

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,079
okay

399
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
number five

400
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,800
is

401
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
you have to

402
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
get enough out of it or at least appear

403
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
sufficiently committed that your form of

404
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
obnoxious deterrence is not going to go

405
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
away on its own

406
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
right you have to be invested in it you

407
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
have to credibly

408
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
convey the notion that you're going to

409
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,839
keep going on as long as the other side

410
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
keeps going on

411
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
okay

412
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,160
now then we get to the converse

413
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
if the results excuse me if the results

414
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
of obnoxious deterrence

415
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,639
are too attractive

416
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,079
then the other side figures you're not

417
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,440
going to give it up

418
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
right

419
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
for instance we carry out carry out a

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,320
lot of cyber espionage as do other

421
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,279
countries we find the results useful

422
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,199
otherwise we wouldn't do them

423
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,600
in fact i may even go out on a limb to

424
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
say that we find the results so useful

425
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
that we would be very loath to give them

426
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,279
up

427
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
to the point where the other side

428
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,440
probably doesn't believe that they can

429
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
negotiate us

430
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
away from doing that sort of stuff

431
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
okay so there's a model here if it's

432
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
painful enough to you you won't keep at

433
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
it if it's beneficial enough to you you

434
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
won't give it up so you have to find a

435
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
sweet spot in the middle

436
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,000
okay

437
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
you also have to have the technical

438
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,320
characteristics where if you promise to

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,279
give it up the other side can detect

440
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
that you're promising to give it up

441
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
right

442
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
if the other side does not have any

443
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
confidence in their ability to monitor

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
your behavior

445
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
if you give it up

446
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,079
you don't have the verify part of the

447
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
trust but verify okay and then finally

448
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
um you should be able to come out ahead

449
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
if the other side does likewise

450
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
and it should be this sort of operation

451
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
that doesn't have an obvious escalation

452
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
path

453
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
now that doesn't mean escalation won't

454
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
occur

455
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,040
but it does mean that in escalating

456
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,639
somebody has to do something radically

457
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
different and there's an inhibition

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,199
against that

459
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,320
okay

460
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,040
having given you all of these criteria

461
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
what have i ended up concluding

462
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
that it's a wonderful idea in practice

463
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
okay but is there any actual form of

464
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
cyber operation that can meet all these

465
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
criteria

466
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
and i can't guarantee that there is

467
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
and you know you're going to end up

468
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,959
pitching a lot of things that might seem

469
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
superficially attractive but not

470
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
necessarily fit this criteria okay

471
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
added issues come from one-on-one

472
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
bargaining for instance the united

473
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
states has a great number of allies

474
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
clearly nato in the pacific etc

475
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,359
to what extent will u.s negotiations on

476
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
behavior in cyberspace reflect the

477
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
interests of these allies or to what

478
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
extent should negotiations proceed

479
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,439
through alliance structures okay now in

480
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,319
europe obviously alliance structure in

481
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
asia not so obvious an alliance

482
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,039
structure where the united states has a

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
set of bilaterals so that's a question

484
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,280
will it necessarily lead to norms

485
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
building

486
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
and this is this is a question of

487
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
narrative okay our current narrative is

488
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
responsible countries don't do

489
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
irresponsible things in cyberspace and

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
once we declare an action to be

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
irresponsible

492
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
it's incumbent on us not to do it

493
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
right because of our argument on norms

494
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
is you're doing something bad

495
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
you're really not in a position to

496
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
actually go ahead and do it

497
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,919
with obnoxious deterrence you've

498
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,240
abandoned that notion everything sort of

499
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,799
becomes reason of state almost up to the

500
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
million dialogue level okay

501
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,039
we don't like what you're doing we're

502
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
going to do what you don't like and then

503
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
we can come to an agreement not that one

504
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
is right or one is wrong or there's a

505
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,960
standard of responsible behavior there

506
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,840
isn't is in many ways morally neutral

507
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
and this notion of moral neutrality

508
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
doesn't really sit well with some people

509
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
which includes me about half the time

510
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,039
okay um

511
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,400
lastly because the united states has at

512
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,039
least two major adversaries to minor

513
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
adversaries in cyberspace there's a lot

514
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
of negotiations would one side see what

515
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
the other side has managed to negotiate

516
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
as a floor or a ceiling

517
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
okay

518
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
so where are we we are

519
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
i can sort of end here i can go to the

520
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,919
next slide which is a set of

521
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,039
okay

522
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,200
okay here's here's the conclusion right

523
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,679
tempting idea in theory practice maybe

524
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,200
not so much

525
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,799
and then here's here's what i say

526
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
questions but i decide to leave out the

527
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
word

528
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,320
okay are we good here we go thank you

529
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
passing the totem pole excellent okay uh

530
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
thank you martin for challenging our

531
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
conceptions of the returns and the same

532
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,039
breath shooting it down in classical

533
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
style excellent before erica sets off if

534
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,720
you don't mind i'm going to very quickly

535
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
abuse my power up here and all of you

536
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
i'm sure will have lots of questions and

537
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
you will be allowed when they're all

538
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
done i have one question because i want

539
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
to pull this back to the

540
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
keynote speaker from our australian

541
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
colleague this morning she talked about

542
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,600
how

543
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
negotiations have only gotten harder

544
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
that

545
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
china and russia are harder to negotiate

546
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
with you've talked about how they pay

547
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
service to rules-based order

548
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
and

549
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,880
do you think

550
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
and again you've shot it down well done

551
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
but do you think what would you

552
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
think about the feasibility of civilian

553
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,600
rules-based negotiations given

554
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
obnoxious deterrence

555
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,039
well if i had a great deal of trust that

556
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,520
you could not only craft a norm's regime

557
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
but keep people to it

558
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
i probably would have selected another

559
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
candidate topic for this form

560
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,760
okay the fact of the matter is she's

561
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,559
right

562
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
right our relations with russia took a

563
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,360
strong downturn after 2014 our relations

564
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
with china have

565
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
faded considerably notably after 2017

566
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,039
when we started raising a lot of trade

567
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,720
issues with china okay they're not

568
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
the optimism that we could have felt

569
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,280
about norms 10 years ago does not exist

570
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
today

571
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
um

572
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
with russia

573
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,200
we'd have to go through a lot of changes

574
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
to get back to there with china

575
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
it's not going to be obvious it's pos

576
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
it's more possible than with russia but

577
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
i wouldn't give it a 100 guarantee okay

578
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,000
now

579
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
when you start talking about norms

580
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
you end up having to talk about

581
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,440
punishment it's fairly clear that

582
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,039
wagging our finger at russia and china

583
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,600
doesn't really work that well

584
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
so the question then becomes what is the

585
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
form of punishment and and can you do

586
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
this in a bilateral negotiation you have

587
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,799
the advantage

588
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,640
and and i i'm thinking in terms of the

589
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
nuclear various nuclear treaties we had

590
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
with the soviet union or that nato had

591
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
with the warsaw pact right and it's like

592
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
if we don't like your be if we think

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
you're cheating we'll just leave simple

594
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,600
straightforward you know what the

595
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
consequences were

596
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,600
okay

597
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,760
[Music]

598
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,120
but when you have a norms-based approach

599
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
particularly it's a multilateral

600
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,360
norms-based approach it doesn't work

601
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,799
right because what are the consequences

602
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,640
if you leave the norms you're going to

603
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,799
misbehave no because you're very

604
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,159
promised you're not going to do bad

605
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,600
things and you've just marked this out

606
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
as bad so you don't have that kind of

607
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
leverage so you're forced to go cross

608
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
domain

609
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
and when you go across domain

610
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,320
at a risk of exaggeration um

611
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
nobody asked me are you exaggerating yes

612
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
i am at the risk of exaggeration you

613
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
either have counter measures that are

614
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,760
weaker than the original effect or

615
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
stronger than the original effect and

616
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,320
the stronger ones the weakness ones tend

617
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
towards irrelevance and the stronger

618
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
ones tend sword escalation

619
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
thank you for a very bleak summary of uh

620
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
future negotiations

621
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,760
uh

622
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,200
speaking of punishment uh erica um floor

623
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
is yours thank you so much oh okay um

624
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
all right hi everyone i'm erica lonergan

625
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,000
i'm really excited to be here um i'm

626
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,520
presenting

627
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,760
a paper that i co-authored with admiral

628
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,320
mark montgomery who um could not be here

629
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,159
today to present with me unfortunately

630
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,240
but i'm really excited to share sort of

631
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,679
our thoughts and ideas with you and i'll

632
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
just caveat this by saying that

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
we sort of see this project

634
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,880
as a conversation starter as the

635
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
beginning of a conversation

636
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,080
um we don't have so the the topic is the

637
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,760
promise and perils of allied offensive

638
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,600
cyber operations we're really focusing

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
on nato in this paper um and we sort of

640
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
have some ideas that we're curious to

641
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
get feedback on and so really excited to

642
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
present this here to get your feedback

643
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
and have some hopefully simulating

644
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
discussion about this topic and i have

645
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,360
the similar caveat as professor lovicky

646
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
my views are my own and they don't

647
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,360
reflect as well as my co-author's views

648
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
are also his own and don't reflect any

649
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
us government

650
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
entity or organization that we are or

651
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
have been affiliated with so

652
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,640
with that um i i thought it would be

653
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
useful

654
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
to give you sort of some background in

655
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
terms of how we started working on this

656
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,400
research project about offensive cyber

657
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
operations in an alliance context more

658
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
specifically in a nato context and it

659
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
really came from our work together on

660
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
the cyberspace delirium commission um

661
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
admiral montgomery was the executive

662
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
director of the commission i was a

663
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
senior director on the commission and

664
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
just by way of some very brief

665
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,760
background because i could spend the

666
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,279
next 20 minutes just talking about the

667
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
commission which which i won't um

668
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,960
congress created this bipartisan

669
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
uh commission in the 2019

670
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,559
national defense authorization act with

671
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,440
the idea that the us government needed

672
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,360
kind of a comprehensive and independent

673
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
but sort of multi-governmental take on

674
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
what you know do we have the right

675
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
strategic approach for cyberspace to

676
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
deter cyber attacks and what are the set

677
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
of policy recommendations both from an

678
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,159
executive branch perspective and a

679
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
legislative perspective that would help

680
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,960
improve our overall deterrence posture

681
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
and i'm just i'm just mentioning this

682
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,279
because you know so so we worked on this

683
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,279
commission for about a year and a half

684
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
came out with this report in march of

685
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
2020 right before everything shut down

686
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
and the the report is from a strategic

687
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
perspective is anchored in this idea of

688
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,720
layered cyber deterrence um i i don't

689
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,200
mean to put out yet another deterrent

690
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
concept for for you all to sort of to

691
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
chew on but um but there

692
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,279
the basic idea of layered cyber

693
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,360
deterrence is that you know we need to

694
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
take cyber deterrence out of its silo

695
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
and um think about how deterrence might

696
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,679
apply differently and look different

697
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,120
across sort of

698
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
the conflict continuum right

699
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
the closer you get uh to the left side

700
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
you're sort of at lower levels of

701
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
competition and as you get further to

702
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,360
the right you you get toward crisis and

703
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,679
conflict um again the point of this

704
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,720
presentation is not to talk about

705
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
layered cyber deterrence but i wanted to

706
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
highlight a few insights from this work

707
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,039
that informed how we sort of started

708
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,480
thinking about

709
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,159
offensive cyber operations in a nato

710
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,679
context and there are three insights in

711
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
particular that i think are relevant to

712
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
give you some context

713
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
the first is that

714
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,799
well the title of this panel our group

715
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
together is um is i think it's is

716
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
offense the best defense in cyber space

717
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
right is that something like that behind

718
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,039
you yes our offensive operation is the

719
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
best defense and so despite the fact

720
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
that i'm talking about offensive cyber

721
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,159
operations and deterrence this afternoon

722
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
with you all i actually don't think that

723
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
offense is the best defense in

724
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
cyberspace um and that was a really

725
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
important insight from the commission's

726
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
work and this idea of layered cyber

727
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,320
deterrence having the credible

728
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,760
capability for effective cost imposition

729
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,480
to include cyber and non-cyber means is

730
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,080
of course an important element of

731
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,320
deterrence right but

732
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,880
alone it is insufficient to address sort

733
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,720
of the full scope of the types and the

734
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,000
magnitude

735
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
and the various actors

736
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,640
that threats that we face in cyberspace

737
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
so that's sort of the first caveat um if

738
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,400
i had to answer that question it would

739
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,159
be no um the second is that

740
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
and this is really where our paper kind

741
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,919
of um the jumping off point for our

742
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
paper is that when we think about cost

743
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
and position

744
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,799
sort of early thinking on cyber

745
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,159
deterrence and in particular early

746
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
strategy and policy in the united states

747
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,559
as well as in um

748
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,080
allied and partner governments has

749
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
really focused on costs and position

750
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
above the threshold of armed conflict

751
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,640
right

752
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
and what

753
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
layered cyber deterrence try to do and

754
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,919
what other approaches have done as well

755
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,360
is is kind of extend that um

756
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,039
left side of the curve

757
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,840
below the threshold of arm conflict um

758
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
with the recognition like professor

759
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,760
libiki mentioned just a few minutes ago

760
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
that um there even when you're sort of

761
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
in a context of competition um for

762
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,880
deterrence to be effective there has to

763
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,200
be some type of um punishment that's

764
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,919
imposed um and then the third insight

765
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
which is uh relevant for the us

766
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
government but also highly relevant even

767
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
i would say more relevant for an

768
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
alliance is that um there are inordinate

769
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
hurdles in terms of

770
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,279
interoperability and coordination within

771
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,320
the federal government um not to mention

772
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,919
between the federal government and state

773
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,840
and local actors and between the federal

774
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
government and the private sector and

775
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,799
these kind of

776
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
coordination and cooperation challenges

777
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,240
were something that we really struggled

778
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,520
with during the commission and i think

779
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
it's also something that is really

780
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
important to take into account when we

781
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,760
think about how an alliance um

782
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
should should think about sort of a

783
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,640
an approach for for cyber operations so

784
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
that's just giving you some

785
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
context um and then the other

786
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,919
sort of more more obvious

787
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,720
source of this project was um was was

788
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,679
really thinking about the threat

789
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
environment and um

790
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,279
there was a typo in there it should say

791
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,720
the primary cyber threat to nato um

792
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
i guess i could have made it a guessing

793
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,559
game to see who could improve

794
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,760
what i'm referring to here but um but so

795
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,919
you know did this work on the commission

796
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
on layered cyber deterrence at the same

797
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
time we're seeing the sort of continuing

798
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
evolution of the threat environment i

799
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,039
think what's really fascinating to me is

800
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
that on the one hand

801
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
you have an alliance like nato that has

802
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
really matured over time in terms of its

803
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,360
thinking and its organization for

804
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
cyber deterrence and defense

805
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
and that focus has really been on sort

806
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,640
of the high-end conflict but what we've

807
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
seen from an empirical perspective

808
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,480
is that

809
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,360
much of the threat stems from sort of

810
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
the range of malicious cyber activity

811
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,559
that takes place

812
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
below that threshold

813
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
rather than sort of the high-end

814
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,799
decisive cyber attack and i think what's

815
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
really interesting and this is probably

816
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
a controversial statement and i'm sure

817
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
there are many in this audience who will

818
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
disagree with me but i'll put it out

819
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,399
there to see what you all think um i

820
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,880
think that there's been a lot of debate

821
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,720
about what are the sort of lessons

822
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,760
learned from um from ukraine um

823
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640
ongoing lessons being learned for cyber

824
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
first sight with the nature of cyber

825
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,279
conflict and there's a panel i think

826
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,279
happening tomorrow that will get into

827
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,440
these questions far more deeply than i

828
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,039
will today but i think that you know

829
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,799
the debate has been framed in this very

830
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,159
binary way

831
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,399
you know with one camp thing cyber isn't

832
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,919
you know is is not important it's not

833
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,200
happening in ukraine in another camp

834
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
saying it is it's just confirmation that

835
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
you know cyber war will take place and

836
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,520
is taking place i think the evidence is

837
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
a lot more mixed and i think that what

838
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,480
at least what's been publicly released

839
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,799
so far whether you look at the microsoft

840
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,559
report or other reports that are coming

841
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,360
out

842
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
as well as statements from senior

843
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,760
government officials that it's actually

844
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,880
far more

845
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,679
nuanced and complicated and challenging

846
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,399
to

847
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,799
coordinate cyber effects with kinetic

848
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,039
effects on the battlefield in a way

849
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
that's decisive

850
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
and the level of coordination that we're

851
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,720
seeing doesn't seem to be perhaps as

852
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
as high as we might have expected which

853
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
is why there have been all these debates

854
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
that have been prompted about well how

855
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,399
come you know where where is all the

856
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,480
cyber war in ukraine there's a lot of

857
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,200
cyber activity um but sort of walking

858
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
the line from cyber activity to sort of

859
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,600
meaningful decisive impact is a lot more

860
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,480
complicated and contested um and so and

861
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,159
this confirms research by a lot of great

862
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,039
academics um like nadia koschuk and yuri

863
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,360
zukov who've done have done work on the

864
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,559
role of cyber operations in the

865
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,559
battlefield in the past um and so i

866
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,720
think that this is all pointing us to

867
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,120
having a conversation about how an

868
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,720
alliance like nato should think about

869
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
the cyber threat not just for the

870
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,880
high-end you know

871
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,640
conflict but also below the level of

872
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
armed conflict right because we know

873
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,240
that's how nato adversaries are

874
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,080
operating

875
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,279
okay

876
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,240
so we try to sort of lay out a bunch of

877
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
research questions in this paper and

878
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
again these are questions that we have

879
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,240
some initial thoughts on answers to

880
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
you know this is sort of the opening

881
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,519
salvo so to speak of a research agenda

882
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,600
so the first question is should there be

883
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,080
a role for offensive cyber operations in

884
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,760
a you know the context of nato

885
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,640
deterrence um sort of below the level of

886
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
armed conflict not just in integrated

887
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
with conventional

888
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
military operations above that threshold

889
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,919
and if so

890
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,080
what are the potential challenges and

891
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
impediments to

892
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
doing something like this which i'll say

893
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,840
off the bat are significant

894
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
but something that i think is important

895
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,039
to start thinking through and having

896
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
those conversations about

897
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,519
which brings me to my last question

898
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,440
which we kind of put out in the research

899
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,679
paper which is what you know what

900
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
initial steps could the alliance start

901
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,679
to start to take

902
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,600
to improve coordination around offensive

903
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,679
cyber

904
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,120
okay so

905
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
you know

906
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
i think it's helpful to kind of lay out

907
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,000
how

908
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,440
um the alliance has evolved both from a

909
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
sort of organizational and capability

910
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
perspective and also from a strategy and

911
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,559
policy perspective since 2008 because

912
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,640
there really has been a lot of

913
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
evolution and maturity of thought and of

914
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,519
organization um but i i think there's

915
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,600
still some sort of unresolved

916
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,360
tensions and mismatches that um that

917
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,399
we're seeing kind of bubble to the

918
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
surface over the past few years and so

919
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,480
you know as i said um how nato has

920
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
organized itself for cyber has evolved a

921
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
lot since bucharest in 2008 um these are

922
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
all things that you all know right um

923
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
there have been a number of

924
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,960
organizations stood up within nato

925
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,200
mostly focused on the defensive aspects

926
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360
of cyber security whether it's incident

927
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,159
response and rapid reaction teams um

928
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
communications the 2016 cyber defense

929
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
pledge where allies pledge to increase

930
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,760
their spending and investment in

931
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,279
you know all these types of defensive

932
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,880
measures training and education and

933
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
information and so on and so forth and

934
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
that's all great

935
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
there's also been

936
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,799
growing but sort of limited organization

937
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,919
on offensive cyber focus on sort of the

938
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,240
integrating cyber into conventional

939
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
military operations uh in 2008 nato set

940
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,159
up the cyber operations center um and

941
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,240
created this sort of voluntary process

942
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,360
for individual nations to provide cyber

943
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,919
effects it reached initial operational

944
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,399
capability in 2020 2021 so again very

945
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,760
sort of new um emergent organizational

946
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,320
uh organizational capability at the same

947
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,040
time there's also been

948
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
really important evolution in nato

949
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
strategic thinking

950
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,320
and nato policy around around cyber

951
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,399
around cyber deterrence and again i'm

952
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,079
sort of reiterating what a lot of people

953
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,359
in this room already know but i think

954
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,359
it's helpful to kind of see

955
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
um how the evolution has taken place

956
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,159
over time right so in 2014

957
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,079
um the alliance

958
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,719
agreed that article 5 the beating heart

959
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,199
of the alliance

960
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
the all for one and one for all applies

961
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
to cyberspace and

962
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,079
in 2016 nato recognized cyberspace as an

963
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,399
operational domain similar to you know

964
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,320
air land at sea

965
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
um i think what's really interesting is

966
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,920
what happened

967
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,480
um the result of the 2021 summit in

968
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,119
brussels where um of course the alliance

969
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,599
reaffirms that article 5 applies to

970
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,400
cyberspace but the language was sort of

971
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,119
different from in the past in particular

972
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,000
um

973
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
you know

974
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
the language of the communique stated

975
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
that the impact of significant malicious

976
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,280
cumulative cyber activities might in

977
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,520
some circumstances be considered as

978
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,359
amounting to an armed attack and

979
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
therefore could potentially be

980
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
justification for

981
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,119
invoking article 5 which would obviously

982
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,920
happen only on a consensus basis but i

983
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
think it's the language is really

984
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,480
interesting because i think it reflects

985
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,200
um

986
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,960
it reflects

987
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
a maturation of thinking about the

988
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
nature of offensive cyber

989
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
and the nature of the threat environment

990
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,119
because you know

991
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,160
we haven't seen the sort of singular

992
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,359
decisive

993
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,520
cyber attack that has major cataclysmic

994
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,240
consequences

995
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
instead

996
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,359
what threat actors have done is sort of

997
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,599
conducted

998
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,280
cyber campaigns that in their

999
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
accumulation could in some circumstances

1000
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,480
rise to

1001
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,960
significant events and so but this gets

1002
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,640
that this kind of

1003
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,280
challenge and ambiguity about where

1004
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,599
exactly the threshold lies for thinking

1005
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,760
about an appropriate

1006
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
um

1007
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,680
retaliatory response in support of a

1008
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320
deterrence objective because it's not

1009
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,839
quite as

1010
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,800
bright and like not quite as a red line

1011
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
in practice as um

1012
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
as perhaps we would like it to be in

1013
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
theory and so i think that this

1014
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,320
evolution and thinking is is really

1015
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,720
important um

1016
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
on the other hand this sort of lingering

1017
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,079
ambiguity

1018
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,800
is um i think presenting some challenges

1019
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,760
for how we think about the effectiveness

1020
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
of a cyber deterrence posture for nato

1021
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,839
um and and those ambiguities are

1022
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,400
reflected in um secretary general

1023
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,040
stoltenberg's press conference and other

1024
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
public statements that have been made um

1025
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
with respect to the ukraine war in terms

1026
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,880
of the application of article 5 with the

1027
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,119
fear that russia might perhaps

1028
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
respond against a nido

1029
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,920
nato member in cyberspace as a

1030
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
retaliation for the inordinate economic

1031
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,720
sanctions regimes nato has been impo

1032
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,280
nato members have imposed on russia

1033
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
right so he says that

1034
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
um yes we've stated that cyber attacks

1035
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,359
can trigger article five but we've never

1036
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,839
gone into we've never really said right

1037
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,320
we've retained strategic ambiguity about

1038
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,000
when and how and the conditions under

1039
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,160
which a particular event might trigger

1040
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,839
article five and yet when you look at

1041
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,599
that um in you know as a follow-on to

1042
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
the brussels communique where you have

1043
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
this kind of um

1044
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,599
sort of loosening of

1045
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,079
what type of incident would constitute

1046
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,960
um

1047
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
a an event that would rise to

1048
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,760
that type of threshold

1049
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,960
i think there are a number of unanswered

1050
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,839
questions and so hopefully

1051
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,920
um hopefully we start to address them

1052
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,079
right and i i think that you know

1053
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,079
yes it's a it's a positive development

1054
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,520
that there has been all this maturation

1055
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
from an organizational perspective from

1056
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,880
a strategy and policy perspective but um

1057
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,119
you know there's sort of these

1058
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,680
unresolved

1059
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,520
tensions or these kind of mismatches

1060
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,720
between

1061
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,760
how um you know between strategy policy

1062
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
organization and the nature of the

1063
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,440
threat environment and i think that

1064
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
starting to have those conversations

1065
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,160
about

1066
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,760
how salient and important are these

1067
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,359
tensions what are the implications for

1068
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,320
the credibility of cyber deterrence um

1069
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,599
how should the alliance think about

1070
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,160
addressing them are um are sort of what

1071
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,359
we're trying to get in this paper and so

1072
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,920
the first the first sort of mismatch or

1073
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
tension that really kind of anchors the

1074
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,400
whole piece is on the one hand you know

1075
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,520
the current

1076
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,240
nato approach has been focused on how

1077
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,160
you know how to integrate offensive

1078
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,480
cyber operations into

1079
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
conventional sort of kinetic campaign

1080
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,680
plans for you know forearmed conflict uh

1081
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,119
which again is a is a important uh

1082
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,920
important investment in in resources but

1083
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,560
you know it's mismatched to the nature

1084
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
of the threat environment where what

1085
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,680
we're seeing the types of threats that

1086
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,040
nato is confronting in cyberspace um

1087
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,160
have not

1088
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,400
really risen to that threshold um

1089
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,839
instead they're they're below that

1090
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,400
threshold um and so

1091
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
does this tension produce any sort of

1092
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,960
credibility or problematic issues for

1093
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
for its cyber deterrence posture

1094
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,000
um the second is that you know on the

1095
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,960
one hand we have it's it's politically

1096
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
convenient to draw this bright

1097
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
demarcation between

1098
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,800
um you know between the level of armed

1099
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
conflict and

1100
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,160
above and below that threshold when in

1101
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,359
reality we know that governments can't

1102
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,599
even agree on what that threshold what

1103
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,920
constitutes that threshold and so the

1104
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,760
ambiguity is sort of politically

1105
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,240
convenient but perhaps not strategically

1106
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,280
useful

1107
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,560
and when you apply that to

1108
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,440
planning and developing capabilities

1109
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,440
around cyber operations um

1110
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,319
it might be sort of nice to try to

1111
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,200
contain that to things that apply to to

1112
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,839
wartime but the reality that we all know

1113
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,520
is that there are things that you have

1114
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,400
to do

1115
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,960
in peace time and in competition

1116
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,040
to prepare for

1117
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280
crisis and conflict and some of those

1118
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
things involve

1119
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,920
uh sort of tricky and potentially

1120
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,119
problematic operations right to conduct

1121
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,839
intelligence uh preparation to gain

1122
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,720
access to strategic targets and so on

1123
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
and so forth and so while it might be

1124
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,640
nice to kind of segment okay you know

1125
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
we're focused on offensive cyber during

1126
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
wartime you know and we we don't really

1127
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,680
want to talk about it you know during

1128
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
during peace simon competition

1129
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
there are things that need to be done

1130
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,079
for

1131
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,680
the employment of those capabilities to

1132
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
be actually effective and useful during

1133
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
wartime right so again the they're these

1134
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,160
sort of tensions um but the same is true

1135
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,920
for offense and defense right

1136
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,200
for you know

1137
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,599
nato um again strategy and policy has

1138
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
been mostly focused on sort of defensive

1139
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,079
cyber um and mostly organized around

1140
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,960
defensive cyber but um

1141
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
you know in in sort of uh

1142
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,440
they're well while some activities are

1143
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,640
obviously defensive and some are

1144
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,839
obviously offensive there's a whole

1145
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,079
range of things that um that are far

1146
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,760
more ambiguous and so again the bright

1147
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,920
lines are not quite as bright in

1148
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,040
practice

1149
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
and then you know there's the reality

1150
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,760
that there are nato members who have

1151
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,920
already articulated

1152
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,480
strategic concepts that take into

1153
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,480
account um countering adversary threats

1154
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,000
below the level of armed conflict the

1155
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,520
united states is an obvious example

1156
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,400
right 2008 was a watershed year for u.s

1157
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,560
cyber strategy and policy with the

1158
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
release of the 2018 department of

1159
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,119
defense cyber strategy which articulated

1160
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,000
this concept of defend forward

1161
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,319
which kind of reflected a

1162
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,720
shift in how

1163
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,319
you know and how the department of

1164
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,560
defense conceived of when and where

1165
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,040
its capabilities would be employed below

1166
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
the level of dharma conflict the same is

1167
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
true of the united kingdom right which

1168
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,720
has become even more and more public

1169
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,359
over time in acknowledging cyber

1170
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,480
operations often conducted in in tandem

1171
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,680
or in collaboration with the united

1172
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,160
states to impose costs on threat actors

1173
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,520
again like below the level around

1174
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,800
conflict so i think all of these kind of

1175
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,680
um

1176
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,480
tensions and ambiguity suggest that

1177
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
a conversation should be started about

1178
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
how we think about um

1179
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,800
offensive cyber below the level of armed

1180
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,000
conflict

1181
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,200
and so

1182
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,560
you know

1183
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
in in offering that

1184
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,040
i'll start by sort of undermining my own

1185
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,079
case

1186
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,160
i guess and um and note that there

1187
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,680
are a whole host of challenges um

1188
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,560
that

1189
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,240
sort of immediately bubble up to the

1190
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,560
surface when we start to think about um

1191
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,400
how to even have how to even have this

1192
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,599
conversation and think about its

1193
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,720
implementation at the political level

1194
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
right um you know

1195
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
and i'm totally i'm going to butcher the

1196
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,319
quote here but um you know when the uh

1197
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,760
when the conflict in ukraine first

1198
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,880
started

1199
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,760
president biden um i think he's repeated

1200
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,440
this line more than once

1201
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,960
but definitely do not quote me on it but

1202
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,920
he is um because i'll bungle the exact

1203
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,000
phrase but he's emphasized over and over

1204
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,359
the importance of the unity of the

1205
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,400
alliance right and how that is um that

1206
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,240
has been critical to it the

1207
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
effectiveness of its of its response to

1208
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,160
russian aggression um when it comes to

1209
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
offensive cyber

1210
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
there isn't there isn't a lot of unity

1211
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,160
there isn't political consensus around

1212
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,079
these issues and that's because there

1213
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,680
still are these sort of persistent

1214
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,560
disagreements about basic um basic

1215
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
concepts and definitions when it comes

1216
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,280
to sort of variations in how sovereignty

1217
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,720
is defined and what constitutes a

1218
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
violation of sovereignty in cyberspace

1219
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,160
variation in terms of you know what

1220
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,200
types of cyber incidents would sort of

1221
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,599
cross a threshold

1222
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,760
into armed attack or even disagreements

1223
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,599
about the difference between use of

1224
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,079
force and armed attack right um

1225
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,599
disagreements about the acceptability of

1226
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
cyber operations to gain access to

1227
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,119
maneuver through within um networks

1228
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
owned by owned by one's allies right um

1229
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,079
and so there are a whole host of

1230
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,000
political challenges that make this a

1231
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,640
difficult conversation um

1232
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,560
even more so there are a whole host of

1233
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
sort of operational and tech and

1234
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,000
tactical challenges in terms of thinking

1235
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
about um implementation and i just have

1236
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,480
you know highlighted a few up here and

1237
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
there are only just a few but um

1238
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,079
but i think it illustrates some of the

1239
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,319
some of the hurdles here um one is sort

1240
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,640
of the relationship between intelligence

1241
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,040
collection requirements and military

1242
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,800
operations both in terms of the fact

1243
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,079
that um you know a given state has to

1244
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,640
make definitions about um intelligence

1245
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
gain loss right and whether they're

1246
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,880
willing to compromise

1247
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,160
access that enables intelligence

1248
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
collection and supports intelligence

1249
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
requirements for the conduct of military

1250
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,079
cyber operation those are only

1251
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,200
compounded when you think about

1252
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,119
aggregating those decisions in alliance

1253
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,880
context particularly given that nato

1254
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,119
rests on consensus

1255
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,240
the other reality is that um you know

1256
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,599
intelligence collection requirements are

1257
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
set at a national governmental level or

1258
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,760
from a nato perspective decisions about

1259
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,599
military operations aren't an alliance

1260
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,640
level right and so you may have um may

1261
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,440
have significant tension there

1262
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,319
cyber operations rests on intelligence

1263
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,480
um and states have been

1264
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,960
you know very circumspect for obvious

1265
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,680
reasons about sharing exquisite

1266
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,599
intelligence that enables

1267
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,920
the type of access that's required for

1268
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,359
conducting

1269
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,319
meaningful strategic cyber operations

1270
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,640
the reality that even allies spy on one

1271
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,960
another right because

1272
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,520
with the exception of certain

1273
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,160
certain alliances um

1274
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,319
you know because espionage is accepted

1275
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,680
accepted state practice um and so uh you

1276
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,480
know

1277
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,319
that poses some challenges and then

1278
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,800
obviously concerns about just you know

1279
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,000
sensitive information that's being

1280
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,920
shared that may that may end up in

1281
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,760
places it's not supposed to um there

1282
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,520
also significant variation in

1283
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,599
capabilities across the alliance um

1284
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,440
there are also concerns about escalation

1285
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
risk although i have that as a question

1286
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,240
mark because in general i'm skeptical

1287
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,000
that um cyber operations create

1288
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,680
meaningful escalation risks i'm happy to

1289
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,680
talk about that in q a if that's of

1290
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,240
interest um i have no idea how i'm doing

1291
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,880
on time i can have a 30 more seconds 30

1292
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,480
more seconds okay

1293
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,760
so um so i think that from in terms of

1294
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,319
in terms of next steps um

1295
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,319
i guess this is as i said sort of an

1296
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,400
opening to a conversation i think it

1297
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,359
would be

1298
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,960
really useful to start having those

1299
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,079
conversations about how an alliance like

1300
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,440
nato might start to think about

1301
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,200
offensive cyber operations not just for

1302
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,960
armed conflict but sort of below that

1303
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,640
level and what that might look like i

1304
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,200
think that interoperability is a bridge

1305
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,280
too far but starting to think about

1306
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,920
improving coordination

1307
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,520
whether it's improving intelligence

1308
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,559
sharing which is sort of an obvious

1309
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,280
recommendation but also you know

1310
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,960
assessing whether you know particular

1311
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,040
alliance members may have a comparative

1312
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,960
advantage in let's say access for

1313
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,880
instance because of geographic proximity

1314
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,839
or capability or what have you whether

1315
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
you know you can sort of divide and

1316
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,920
conquer a cyber a cyber campaign um

1317
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
particularly for developing access and

1318
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,280
capabilities against you know really

1319
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,920
strategic difficult targets

1320
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
but anyway um

1321
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
as i said initial conversation looking

1322
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,720
forward to your thoughts and questions

1323
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
and i think that was 30 seconds

1324
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,520
okay thank you

1325
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
thank you erica very much for

1326
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,960
introducing conversation with a healthy

1327
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,960
academic attitude of immediately red

1328
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,119
teaming your own point well done both of

1329
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,000
you um again i'm going to take advantage

1330
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,400
of being up here

1331
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,920
and i have a thought on the

1332
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,359
ancient uh um

1333
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
tactic of war death by a thousand gods

1334
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,480
well not so much war as a torture method

1335
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,559
death by a thousand cuts um the low

1336
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,400
sophistication operations that you're

1337
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,640
constantly seeing against

1338
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,319
various targets frankly all over the

1339
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,480
world but very often against western

1340
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,440
democracies do you think this proverbial

1341
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
cyber war would it be fair to say that

1342
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,079
the target at the end of the day is the

1343
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,400
core foundation of what builds these

1344
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,240
states namely namely this

1345
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,359
liberal democratic world order

1346
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,920
rules based order that is a big so so

1347
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,440
just so i understand your question

1348
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,800
correctly so you're asking whether the

1349
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,720
sort of death by a thousand cuts in

1350
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,839
cyberspace over time will erode

1351
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,520
what we understand is the foundations of

1352
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,960
the liberal world order correct okay no

1353
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,079
okay very cool i can elaborate

1354
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,760
you may get a chance later but first

1355
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
okay uh we're going to move over to uh

1356
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,520
michael and hear a bit about the

1357
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,760
non-state actors that

1358
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,240
are involved in other operations

1359
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,119
yeah

1360
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,480
thank you to to erica and martin for

1361
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,240
great presentations and thank you all

1362
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,200
for being here so uh our research topic

1363
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,760
with my colleague yakupuri sitting there

1364
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,559
is

1365
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,880
about non-state actors and specifically

1366
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,240
bransonburg groups and but it is uh

1367
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,440
possible and feasible for us to try to

1368
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,000
counter the activities through offensive

1369
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,599
cyber operations

1370
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,720
so before we start the usual disclaimers

1371
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,040
that uh

1372
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,920
we all like to use uh i would like to

1373
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
also mention the the second one and that

1374
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,760
is that we used only uh open source and

1375
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,359
public information

1376
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,839
which is also one of the limits of our

1377
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,720
research so before i get to the topic of

1378
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,040
the offensive operations let's maybe try

1379
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,119
to create some shared understanding of

1380
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,800
where we currently are with the

1381
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,000
ransomware issue and how we got there

1382
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,119
so

1383
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,559
on one side you have numbers and volumes

1384
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,480
and data about how it is how it uh is

1385
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,599
going

1386
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,400
to uh how it uh over the last few years

1387
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,079
got a bit worse

1388
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,599
and

1389
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,079
on on the other side quite literally you

1390
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,480
have to the stories and the

1391
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,280
the other uh considerations behind that

1392
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,000
so we've seen uh events like uh the

1393
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,720
colonial pipeline attack the jbs and

1394
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,520
cassaya we have seen

1395
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,880
attacks on healthcare and

1396
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,599
education systems during the hate of the

1397
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,760
global pandemic

1398
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
and we have also seen

1399
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
conti one of the major groups pledging

1400
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,480
support to to russian government and

1401
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,079
threatening

1402
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,960
retaliation to anybody else

1403
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,440
who would who would try to to attack

1404
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,680
russia in the in the events in ukraine

1405
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,839
and what we haven't seen are the

1406
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,640
countless attacks on on uh small and

1407
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,480
media business businesses causing

1408
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,800
economic damages that we simply do not

1409
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,319
uh know about

1410
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,040
uh because of under reporting

1411
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,640
so

1412
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,440
how did we actually get there

1413
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,400
we have currently something that we call

1414
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,440
as a vancouver as a service which is um

1415
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,920
no longer a bunch of hackers hiding in a

1416
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,160
basement and launching cyberattacks but

1417
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,200
rather a thriving business environment

1418
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,000
with you know dedicated roles

1419
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,599
management people

1420
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,720
budgets rented offices

1421
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
vacation plans and even office politics

1422
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,520
so we have different people that

1423
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,839
specialize in in doing things they're

1424
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,440
good at be that

1425
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,160
the the initial access the hacking be

1426
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,720
that encrypting the networks handling

1427
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,200
customers payments and infrastructure

1428
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,480
and we also highlighted several

1429
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,040
factors that we think are contributing

1430
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,319
or are important to that helped create

1431
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,880
this this ecosystem and that is the

1432
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,359
network effect or the the availability

1433
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,319
to share and buy and sell the initial

1434
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,400
accesses tools knowledge to recruit and

1435
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,000
market their own brands in the in the um

1436
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,839
system of underground forum and

1437
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,440
microplaces

1438
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,079
obviously the ransomware business

1439
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,079
couldn't really be conducted at the

1440
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,800
scale without cryptocurrencies which

1441
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,160
allowed to uh the transfers of millions

1442
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,599
of euros or dollars whatever you prefer

1443
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,520
without the traditional oversight of

1444
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,079
banking industry and governments

1445
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,839
and we have also the geopolitical

1446
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,440
considerations that limit our law

1447
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,119
enforcement activities and especially

1448
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:21,599
non-cooperative jurisdictions that

1449
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,800
harbor

1450
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,880
their cyber criminals in exchange that

1451
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,839
they don't target their own people

1452
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,920
so

1453
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,480
to tackle these challenges

1454
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,680
over the past few years many experts and

1455
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,640
indeed

1456
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,880
public military and intelligence

1457
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,760
officials sounded the

1458
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,880
the notion that you know this is maybe a

1459
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,800
national security issue that should be

1460
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
handled

1461
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,640
also with the use of offensive cyber

1462
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,960
operations and especially by military

1463
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
and intelligence agencies

1464
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,839
so that is a starting point of a point

1465
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,839
of our paper

1466
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,800
to

1467
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,559
try to approach it from

1468
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,920
a data-driven way or the the empiric way

1469
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,559
we try to select and and find out as

1470
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,280
much case studies as we could on

1471
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,760
the broadest sense of what could be

1472
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,440
considered as

1473
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,599
an offensive cyber operation against

1474
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,280
ransomware group

1475
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,559
and

1476
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,920
the broadest sense is in in our research

1477
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,280
basically the any unauthorized use of

1478
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,559
systems and and data that these

1479
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,799
these groups are using

1480
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,520
and

1481
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,160
we also try to leverage the the

1482
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,359
information we have on other operations

1483
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,480
against uh against non-state actors be

1484
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
that the operation glowing symphony by

1485
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,400
jdf aries

1486
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,160
uh against isis or the the multinational

1487
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,400
european-led uh

1488
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,760
europa league disruption of emote.net

1489
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,240
that also had an offensive cyber

1490
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,079
component by by netherlands police

1491
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,280
so

1492
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,000
with this approach there are obviously

1493
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,319
some challenges and limitations that

1494
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,160
mainly stem from uh from the the lack of

1495
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,720
data and observability

1496
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,599
and

1497
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,440
but i start with the first one and that

1498
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,599
is how do you differ

1499
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,599
the the impact of offensive cyber

1500
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,920
operations versus other factors be that

1501
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,880
political pressure economic and social

1502
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,079
developments or even the the traditional

1503
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,799
law enforcement activities

1504
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,359
the second challenge is

1505
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,440
how do you actually measure impact in a

1506
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,839
in a next system that is rapidly

1507
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,720
changing and involving almost every day

1508
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,240
or every week due to how the groups and

1509
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,799
the variants rise

1510
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,400
disband rebrand under pressure and what

1511
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,680
is essentially partially obscured to us

1512
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,680
because we don't have the visibility

1513
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,799
there

1514
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,599
and the first third one is

1515
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,079
about how do you account for events and

1516
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,160
information that is not available in the

1517
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,760
public public sphere so

1518
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,720
those are obviously a big challenges to

1519
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,319
to our research and that is

1520
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,720
also why we don't

1521
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
presume to

1522
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,520
present results but uh

1523
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
we are already trying to to make some

1524
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,559
initial observations that will hopefully

1525
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,119
be before the developers as our

1526
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,200
understanding and the data set grows

1527
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
so um

1528
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,640
for the the observations themselves we

1529
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,520
try to divide them into two logical

1530
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,559
groups and that is impact on the whole

1531
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,359
ecosystem level and on the individual

1532
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,480
act level

1533
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,119
um however the

1534
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,799
uh

1535
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,920
the division or the declassification is

1536
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,559
really an artificial one and they often

1537
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,559
overlap and

1538
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,760
influence each other

1539
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,000
the so the first one that we have seen

1540
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,040
on the x system level is is exclusion

1541
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,720
from the broader

1542
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,160
uh

1543
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,319
cyber crime ecosystem

1544
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,520
and that was noticeable especially after

1545
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,200
the colonial pipeline attacks and

1546
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,119
subsequent events

1547
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:31,920
that

1548
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,280
uh the ransomware operators and variants

1549
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,160
and

1550
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,240
affiliates were

1551
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,160
ostracized by the the rest of the the

1552
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,319
underground ecosystem because of the the

1553
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,640
pressure and the visibility that was

1554
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,040
uh against them that impacted other

1555
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,119
people's operation

1556
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,799
um

1557
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,000
we have also seen the the influence and

1558
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,480
that is this is really hard to discern

1559
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,599
from the other uh from the other factors

1560
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,400
that that come into play here

1561
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,480
regarding targeting be that from the

1562
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,920
industry or the geographic

1563
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,680
consideration

1564
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,400
and we have also seen some shifts in the

1565
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,119
operating models so in the in the public

1566
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,680
operating model the it's really the

1567
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,040
brand of the

1568
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,319
and the the the malware that gets

1569
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,720
presented to the affiliates which are

1570
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,520
free to use them with for a fee

1571
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,160
but uh some groups especially after the

1572
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,200
pressure uh converted a bit more into

1573
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,960
the private model where they can

1574
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,920
carefully select their affiliates so the

1575
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,559
people who do the actual hacking and

1576
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,280
also their upstream and downstream uh

1577
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,920
business partners and try to vet them

1578
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,240
and try to keep the the operation and

1579
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,920
the reps

1580
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,480
which also limits their profits and

1581
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,160
scalability

1582
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,359
so

1583
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,520
in especially in connection with the

1584
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,559
first

1585
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,480
first individual level uh

1586
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,599
factor

1587
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,720
is the

1588
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,520
uh shifts in

1589
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,000
the most popular strains so the strains

1590
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,799
that have been compromised or were known

1591
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,520
to be compromised had a

1592
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,559
harder time to to attract uh new

1593
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,960
affiliates to recruit to sell their uh

1594
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,599
you know programs and that led up to

1595
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,960
some shifts in in what was the the most

1596
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,599
popular the the hype at the moment

1597
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:36,559
the

1598
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,040
brands and reputation are really at the

1599
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,559
the core of of ransomware stuff

1600
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,720
apart from the prophets which i'll talk

1601
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,880
about in a moment

1602
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,319
um they

1603
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,000
impact how they can attract developers

1604
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,480
pen testers and the low levels

1605
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,440
uh low-level staff which we don't often

1606
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,799
hear about

1607
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,119
but it has also some kind of

1608
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,680
consideration on the victim's side and

1609
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,799
that is

1610
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,440
to have the reputation on the one hand

1611
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,240
to

1612
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,520
be able to follow up on threats to be

1613
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,760
able to actually keep the

1614
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,280
the data encrypted and to be able to

1615
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,960
with the the technique of double

1616
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,400
extortion to have them uh available to

1617
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,720
the public so the confidential

1618
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,599
confidential data of of companies and

1619
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,400
organizations

1620
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,440
so the second potential impact

1621
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,559
or the the impact we have seen is uh

1622
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,839
obviously on the core of the

1623
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,000
run software business and that is profit

1624
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,799
margins and bottom lines

1625
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,640
and it's

1626
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,598
noticeable from

1627
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,400
especially from the the county case the

1628
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,920
county was

1629
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,720
one of the largest organizations until

1630
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,559
very recently

1631
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,559
and after

1632
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,880
their own compromises and also

1633
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,799
compromises of their

1634
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,920
close business partners they often

1635
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,400
burned down and rebuild their whole

1636
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,760
infrastructure

1637
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,559
they often dismissed and then rehearsed

1638
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,240
a lot of their stuff

1639
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,280
excluding for a several feet that they

1640
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,160
knew

1641
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,200
let's say uh in the real world or

1642
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,400
had

1643
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,760
a long

1644
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,640
long

1645
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,480
relationship with

1646
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,359
they were rebuilding identities changing

1647
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,160
nicknames and emails and accesses

1648
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,240
and they also

1649
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,119
which is kind of ironic uh had to

1650
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,359
increase their security spending

1651
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,760
on solutions that uh

1652
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
were helping them to monitor their

1653
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,400
administrators and also they were buying

1654
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,480
tools like endpoint detection and

1655
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,480
response

1656
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,400
we can't also discount the psychological

1657
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,760
effects which were mostly seen on the on

1658
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,280
the arrival case

1659
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,960
so in a

1660
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,839
very simplistic way what we can say

1661
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,520
about the case

1662
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,480
about the the group is that after the

1663
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,440
compromise of a single server

1664
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,000
and subsequent actions on objectives

1665
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
that were

1666
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,119
as far as we know uh

1667
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:21,839
uh

1668
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,799
focused on under identifying members of

1669
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,119
the group they're scrambled

1670
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,400
and it's also uh it's of course the the

1671
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,400
um

1672
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,599
influence of

1673
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,520
other factors and other

1674
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,400
other

1675
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,920
uh events but uh that that is the the

1676
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,160
short version

1677
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,039
and

1678
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,960
one thing that

1679
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,839
is sometimes overlooked in

1680
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,960
focusing on the the most impactful

1681
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,160
and the leadership and the

1682
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,039
the pen testers or the hackers is that

1683
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,000
there is

1684
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,720
a lot of low-level support staff

1685
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,359
handling operations that's

1686
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,920
laundering money without administrating

1687
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,520
servers and

1688
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,760
botnets and what so

1689
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,000
uh that

1690
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,160
are usually low

1691
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,839
uh low-level poorly paid

1692
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,039
and they they sometimes resent what they

1693
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,319
are doing

1694
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,520
and

1695
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,799
by

1696
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,760
uh making their half uh

1697
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,160
their lives harder we can influence the

1698
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,720
the burnout and their motivation to

1699
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,919
continue to do so

1700
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,240
of course there are some other

1701
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,119
intervening factors that both allow us

1702
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,839
with some options and uh considerable

1703
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,799
challenges for this topic

1704
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,319
and that is

1705
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,119
uh

1706
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,799
as as for us

1707
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:57,119
the criminals also have hard time doing

1708
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,280
a lot of basic stuff like securing their

1709
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,319
infrastructure and keeping their

1710
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,480
anonymity on over time

1711
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,720
and trust on the internet is hard and

1712
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,280
it's especially hard with

1713
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,280
the underground's forums and lack of

1714
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,400
real identities

1715
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
what

1716
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
is challenging for us

1717
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,319
is many things in that this respect

1718
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,480
first of all balancing

1719
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,119
legality and proportionality

1720
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,400
and not over militarizing

1721
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,039
the issue

1722
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,200
spillovers and accidents are always a

1723
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,920
concern for a predominantly civilian

1724
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,160
infrastructure

1725
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,839
and

1726
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,319
allocation of resources actually means

1727
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,039
two things here so that is of course

1728
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,319
balancing

1729
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,200
uh

1730
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,039
the focus on cyber criminals with what

1731
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
other

1732
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,319
threats and threat actors we have and

1733
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,599
there are many

1734
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,200
but it's also

1735
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,160
to be able to define what is important

1736
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,119
to us

1737
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,720
and to not get into the trap of a

1738
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,119
tactical weka mole of trying to do

1739
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,880
everything or trying to just you know

1740
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
suppress everything that is that is

1741
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,119
there

1742
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,280
so to conclude

1743
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,119
um

1744
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,160
from the data and from the cases we have

1745
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,000
seen the

1746
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,359
this uh approach of offensive cyber

1747
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,079
operations against transomburg groups is

1748
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,640
maybe best perceived as an important

1749
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,640
soul in the whole of government approach

1750
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,480
but

1751
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,000
providing that we have some basic

1752
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,440
some basic

1753
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,720
prerequisites like cooperation inside

1754
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,280
and outside of the public sector deep

1755
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,079
understanding of the environment and

1756
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,240
maybe most important of all

1757
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,760
reasonable

1758
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,799
goals and definitions of success of what

1759
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,000
we want to and what we can achieve in

1760
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,640
that space

1761
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,640
and that is why this is not the silver

1762
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,319
bullet

1763
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,839
but rather

1764
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,640
the part of the whole tool set

1765
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,960
and with that i thank you for your

1766
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,839
attention and i'm happy to receive your

1767
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,319
questions

1768
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,119
thank you michael for

1769
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,359
highlighting the unforgiving nature of

1770
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,200
this domain where both your

1771
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,359
proverbial good guys and bad guys face

1772
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,839
rather similar challenges

1773
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,680
i am going to stop abusing my power as

1774
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,079
moderator and i won't bug you anymore

1775
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,240
but i'm going to try to summarize you

1776
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,760
know because this panel has a question

1777
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,559
as its title i think we can say that

1778
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,960
erica does not believe that offensive

1779
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,119
operations are the best defenses

1780
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,520
martin thinks that obnoxious behavior

1781
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,480
can compel actors to behave

1782
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,640
and michael

1783
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,520
maybe

1784
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,640
and michael's observations uh indicate

1785
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,400
that disruption is effective but

1786
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,079
certainly no silver bullet so that's a

1787
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,240
yes no one a maybe yeah

1788
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,720
excellent

1789
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,079
i think you all want to take credit for

1790
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,400
the maybe right so i'll turn the floor

1791
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,319
over to our wonderful audience thank you

1792
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,160
all for your patience um before we get

1793
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,839
started i will remind you to please

1794
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,079
introduce yourself name affiliation

1795
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,359
whatever else you want to share about

1796
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,839
yourself but very quickly getting to an

1797
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,240
actual question we have about 22 minutes

1798
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,640
left and out of respect for your fellow

1799
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,039
audience members try to keep it brief uh

1800
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,359
also if possible i prefer if you can

1801
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,079
direct your questions at a specific

1802
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,680
panel member instead of

1803
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,200
an answer from the entire panel because

1804
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,720
then well we're not going to get through

1805
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,480
a lot of questions we have two very

1806
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,839
eager ones in the front row so i think

1807
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,079
we'll start with uh youtube

1808
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,240
and then i promise to look to the far

1809
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,520
back as well so you won't be ignored

1810
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,200
all right thank you so much for the

1811
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,960
wonderful presentations my name is

1812
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,440
aleidar amirsid i'm from kazakhstan i

1813
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,760
represent the private company so not a

1814
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,280
nato allied nation

1815
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,400
so i have a question to dr libiki and dr

1816
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,359
lonergan about how does the

1817
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,599
state-sponsored hacktivism

1818
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,000
fit into the consideration of obnoxious

1819
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,279
deterrence

1820
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,560
because and in terms of

1821
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,799
offensive cyber operation short war in

1822
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,000
the sense that

1823
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,520
in the last couple of years and

1824
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,279
specifically with this situation in

1825
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,080
ukraine uh what we have seen is that the

1826
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,238
um great

1827
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,319
increase in uh

1828
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,319
activist group being active and hacking

1829
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,640
governmental servers government websites

1830
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,399
with defacements and

1831
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,040
uh personal data leaks which happened to

1832
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,000
the numerous uh private companies so in

1833
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,399
a way uh what i'm trying to say in in

1834
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,399
case of dr labiki

1835
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,198
uh state sponsored hacktivism offers

1836
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,600
this kind of uh plausible in my opinion

1837
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,719
offers this kind of plausible

1838
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,359
deniability for the state in order to

1839
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,319
uh denying their obnoxious behavior in a

1840
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,839
cyberspace and at the same time

1841
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,839
state sponsor hacktivism in certain

1842
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,719
cases can be considered as an cyber

1843
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,120
operation short of war and in this case

1844
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,359
who should be responsible for it and

1845
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,679
what should be done about those type of

1846
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:20,880
situations

1847
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,080
thank you hopefully i was brief okay let

1848
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,679
me redefine your question of course as

1849
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,120
an academic

1850
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,640
the question is

1851
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,359
what about non-state actors acting under

1852
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,600
the color of state but not obviously

1853
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,399
under the state right yes uh how do we

1854
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,080
prove they're acting as part of the

1855
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,238
state and that's part of the attractive

1856
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,560
feature of obnoxious deterrence we don't

1857
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,319
have to prove anything

1858
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,198
we just go back to our behavior now if

1859
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,560
it turns out

1860
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,040
that we react to their behavior and they

1861
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,960
didn't do it

1862
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,480
their motivation to stay in the deal

1863
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,480
goes correspondingly down

1864
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,239
so we still have to maintain that

1865
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,120
incentive by being roughly right and the

1866
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,280
more correct we are

1867
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,120
the more we preserve their incentive to

1868
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,360
be part of the deal okay

1869
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
the problem with standard deterrence is

1870
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,520
exactly the one you point out you know

1871
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,600
the russians say hey it's not sorry i

1872
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,600
don't want to pick on them except i do

1873
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,679
you know it's uh

1874
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,080
we're not responsible for these guys

1875
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,600
right and then we have to start making

1876
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,040
the case

1877
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,719
forget about it and we think you're

1878
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,320
responsible and this is how we're

1879
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,880
reacting

1880
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,920
erica would you like to get those um

1881
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,800
i

1882
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,320
i think it's a great question i won't

1883
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,400
rephrase the question but i think that

1884
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,320
you know i don't

1885
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,600
i think when we talk about sort of proxy

1886
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,520
actors in cyberspace it's often held up

1887
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,360
as this thing that challenges deterrence

1888
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,640
or something that is particularly

1889
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,040
problematic and um i i guess i don't

1890
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,960
find as problematic as maybe some others

1891
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,520
do and i think that's because um

1892
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,920
you know i'll steal a phrase from from

1893
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,840
jay healey and you know he talks about

1894
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,760
the spectrum of state responsibility

1895
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,480
right

1896
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,040
um so we can think about different um

1897
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,520
you know the the extent to which a

1898
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,560
particular sort of target of a cyber

1899
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,679
operation believes that a government

1900
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,320
rather than sort of a lone wolf you know

1901
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,280
hacker or organization is responsible

1902
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,360
for that for that activity and so and

1903
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,520
it's a spectrum right at the end of the

1904
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,920
day these are political decisions less

1905
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,719
than they are sort of um sort of

1906
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,679
technical ones right um and so and so

1907
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,040
that's why i think it's useful to think

1908
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,080
about responsibility along a spectrum

1909
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,159
rather than as this binary you know did

1910
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,600
the state sponsor it or did they not

1911
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,280
sponsor it i think what's really

1912
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,960
interesting when you bring up the

1913
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,199
example of ukraine is that

1914
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,400
what i find most fascinating about the

1915
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,000
cyber dynamics

1916
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,080
in that context are is sort of the

1917
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,120
decision on the part of the

1918
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,000
government

1919
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,440
in ukraine to sort of throw away

1920
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,520
plausible deniability probably because

1921
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,520
it's not so important during an actual

1922
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,080
conflict although russia still maintains

1923
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,320
you know denies responsibility for cyber

1924
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,760
attacks in the context of ukraine even

1925
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,280
though we all know that to be ludicrous

1926
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,120
right but um

1927
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,040
you know the uh ukraine has taken the

1928
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,880
opposite approach and and and sort of

1929
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,719
very publicly said okay we are we are

1930
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,920
calling on an i.t army um and you know

1931
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,000
we are going to give this army

1932
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,239
directives through a telegram channel

1933
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,080
and actually provide a targeting list

1934
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,520
and say okay go right that's the most um

1935
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,120
you know straightforward example of

1936
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,600
state directed cyber activity and then

1937
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,960
you have all the way at the other end of

1938
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,480
the spectrum states like russia that

1939
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,719
completely deny these types of things so

1940
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,640
i think about along a spectrum

1941
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,320
i don't think it's that problematic i

1942
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,159
think decisions about response are

1943
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,000
ultimately political but i do think

1944
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,480
that's why when we think about sort of

1945
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,360
um

1946
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,080
rapid responses short of war

1947
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,800
getting at a reasonable level of rapid

1948
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,440
attribution is really important for

1949
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,360
western democratic states to be able to

1950
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,239
justify taking a response and things

1951
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,159
that improve

1952
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,920
our ability to rapidly attribute

1953
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,159
particularly to share information that

1954
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,239
others may have about that would enable

1955
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,159
more rapid attribution i think i think

1956
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,679
is a really important thing and by

1957
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,360
attribution i don't necessarily mean

1958
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,840
public attribution right um i think

1959
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,760
um their

1960
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,120
sort of internal confidence might be

1961
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
sufficient to be able to respond in a

1962
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,520
rapid way

1963
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,480
i will uh dive into this and add just to

1964
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
shamelessly plug a recent ccdcoe

1965
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,320
publication

1966
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,960
for a legal analysis of your question

1967
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,800
there was recently a paper published by

1968
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,040
the by the center i could highlight

1969
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,560
recommend so you get the political

1970
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,040
expertise here and uh legal ones on our

1971
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,320
website

1972
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,159
please

1973
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,600
thank you um

1974
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,480
it's a peak northern europe but when you

1975
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,400
raise your hand you are labeled a very

1976
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,800
eager one

1977
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,880
saint sacco is my name i am a stone an

1978
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,320
ambassador to

1979
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,760
to helsinki

1980
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,360
they um and

1981
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,320
dr labiki the question is is this to you

1982
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,520
if i

1983
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,440
understood you correctly

1984
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,000
you said that

1985
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,960
in

1986
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,400
meeting out retribution it's good to

1987
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,080
keep in the same domain

1988
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,199
uh not

1989
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,280
you know do it cross domain or outside

1990
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,719
of the same domain was that some

1991
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,320
something would have said could you

1992
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,159
unpack it in a way because i mean it

1993
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,520
seems to me

1994
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,560
probably the opposite because um

1995
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,840
uh

1996
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,840
you can have a better dictatory policy

1997
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,239
saying if you do this i'll do that in

1998
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,719
you know in some other domain uh also

1999
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,239
you can

2000
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,719
dial it up or down better because as you

2001
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,360
said in the cyber domain you cannot be

2002
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,000
that certain of a intended effect

2003
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,840
happening on the other side

2004
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,000
uh and so what basically when you when

2005
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,760
you have done your attribution your

2006
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,679
retribution is actually

2007
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,120
let's say

2008
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,080
and it would be also more obnoxious just

2009
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,239
not to limit yourself to do whatever you

2010
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,120
want wouldn't that be a peak obnoxious

2011
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,880
yes thank you

2012
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,000
all right

2013
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,640
um let me go to two reasons

2014
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,800
first reason is

2015
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,960
the usefulness of putting your obnoxious

2016
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,040
behavior in the cyber domain is that

2017
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,719
when you come to negotiations it limits

2018
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,560
the scope of the negotiations and the

2019
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,080
more the negotiations are down scoped

2020
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,480
the fewer extraneous matters there are

2021
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,360
to derail it okay then i expressed

2022
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,880
another opinion

2023
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,760
which was

2024
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,520
that there was a tendency for things

2025
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,840
weaker than cyber to be ineffective and

2026
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,840
things stronger than cyber to be highly

2027
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,920
risky and you want some sort of risk

2028
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,719
risk effectiveness trade-off

2029
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,199
but i want to bring up a point which i

2030
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,159
i didn't maybe i should have

2031
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,719
one of the problems with sanctions

2032
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,400
particularly the way the united states

2033
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,960
has applied them is that it's not a

2034
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,280
hundred percent clear why we've

2035
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,520
introduced the sanctions on particular

2036
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,679
particular parties

2037
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,960
okay in the criminal justice system

2038
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,760
when

2039
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,280
you go in front of the court it's for a

2040
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,280
particular crime and that's what you're

2041
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,560
sentenced for

2042
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,480
okay or not sentence force depending on

2043
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,719
the outcome and when you start wandering

2044
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,640
off that crime

2045
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,719
you've changed the nature

2046
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,440
of the question you want the person that

2047
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,880
you're punishing

2048
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,120
to understand that they are punished for

2049
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,360
what they do

2050
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,800
you don't want them to get the

2051
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,159
impression that they are punished for

2052
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,679
who they are

2053
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,520
right because if you punish them for

2054
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,560
what they do you have a chance of being

2055
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,640
able to modify their behavior so they

2056
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,040
don't do what you don't want them to do

2057
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,880
but if you're punishing them for who

2058
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,360
they are or more specifically if they

2059
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,600
start believing that they are punished

2060
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,920
for who they are you cannot change their

2061
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,280
behavior

2062
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,199
because they're not going to stop being

2063
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,440
who they are and a lot of what we've

2064
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,679
seen in the rhetoric and this is beyond

2065
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,199
cyberspace but it's also within

2066
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:02,239
cyberspace is the united states is doing

2067
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,040
is to me not because of what i've done

2068
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,480
they just don't like me right

2069
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,960
at that point your deterrence policy is

2070
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,480
essentially over

2071
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,920
because that's the attitude from the

2072
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,159
other guy it's one of the paradoxes of

2073
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,000
deterrence policy

2074
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,840
but of course after 10 seconds of

2075
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,199
continuous thought you realize yeah

2076
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,159
that's true that it depends entirely on

2077
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,920
what goes on between the ears of your

2078
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,199
adversary

2079
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,880
and if they haven't bought into your

2080
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,719
line you don't have deterrence

2081
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,040
see

2082
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,400
we're going to go all the way to the

2083
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,600
back

2084
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,199
john i do believe

2085
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,040
has his hand up

2086
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,280
oh sorry sorry go ahead you go ahead you

2087
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,280
already have a mic i promise to go to

2088
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,040
the back and john promised to be

2089
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,679
annoying so it's a good combination good

2090
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:50,719
afternoon

2091
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,800
i'm a dutch cyber diplomat in brussels

2092
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,600
both at the eu as well as nato i have a

2093
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,679
question to both erica martin but first

2094
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,000
a comment um and i hope that you will be

2095
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,120
there friday at the eu nato strategic

2096
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,600
outlook panel where i'll be more

2097
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,560
going in-depth on what the eu has done

2098
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,040
but i just want to mention that when you

2099
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,960
use the examples eric about imposing

2100
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,280
costs and you mentioned us in the uk

2101
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,520
since 2019 the u.s done um a lot as well

2102
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,320
i'll go more in detail to that on friday

2103
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,400
but i had a question on the strategic

2104
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,719
ambiguity when it comes to article five

2105
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,600
i didn't create quite get whether you

2106
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,400
were

2107
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,280
advising us to be more precise or where

2108
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,360
you are agreeing that there is some sort

2109
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,480
of deterrent effect of not being precise

2110
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,880
on what article 5 would trigger and i

2111
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,400
would be interested to hear martin's

2112
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,480
perspective on this as well thank you

2113
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,360
yeah

2114
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,199
absolutely so i i i

2115
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,360
i think that strategic ambiguity

2116
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,239
um is not as effective i think strategic

2117
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,760
ambiguity is not as effective in this

2118
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,080
context as perhaps it is in others um

2119
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,000
although it's a you know preferred

2120
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,280
approach by

2121
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,960
the united states and by nato and by

2122
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,840
others and i guess my concern is that um

2123
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,000
i'm a bit of a cyber skeptic in general

2124
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
right and so i think that

2125
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,679
my concern is that given that there is

2126
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,000
ambiguity about the application of

2127
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,880
article 5 in cyberspace and a lack of

2128
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,719
consensus about the conditions under

2129
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,960
which a particular incident would

2130
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,640
potentially rise to a threshold of

2131
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,960
article 5. and given that there's been

2132
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,760
sort of a revision of you know nato's

2133
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,480
statement around how article 5 applies

2134
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,159
to cyberspace which could include sort

2135
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,679
of the cumulative malicious cyber

2136
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,520
attacks rather than a single decisive

2137
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,800
cyber attack

2138
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,920
my concern is that um

2139
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,239
it holds at risk the credibility of

2140
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,840
article the credibility of article 5 in

2141
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,920
cyberspace is is

2142
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,320
contested and that this could have sort

2143
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,199
of

2144
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,199
secondary effects on the broader

2145
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,120
credibility of article 5 which is where

2146
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,360
i think it actually matters and i know

2147
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,120
we're at a cyber conference and so i

2148
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,800
imagine many will disagree with me but

2149
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,920
at the end of the day what i care about

2150
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,920
um and what i think is important from

2151
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,679
sort of a more of a political science

2152
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,040
international relations perspective

2153
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,880
unless a cyber security perspective is

2154
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,000
actually deterring an attack a real

2155
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,600
attack on nato um whether it comes

2156
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
conventionally or god forbid nuclear

2157
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,520
weapons right like that's where it

2158
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,360
really matters and

2159
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,760
and i i think that there are you know

2160
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,679
certain types of cyber attacks could

2161
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,360
rise to that threshold but i think

2162
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,760
they're very few and the likelihood that

2163
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,840
they're going to happen um there

2164
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,679
probably will be other things that would

2165
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,000
already um in conjunction with or in

2166
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,480
tandem with a cyber incident that would

2167
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,719
you know that would make it obvious that

2168
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,239
we're in sort of a

2169
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,080
article 5 situation and i think the

2170
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,679
problem is that with this lingering

2171
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,920
ambiguity um there are all these things

2172
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,679
we could point to that well you know is

2173
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,360
this a cumulative malicious cyber

2174
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,159
incident or not what does this mean for

2175
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,440
you know for article 5 and nato and um

2176
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,840
and i worry about sort of the the follow

2177
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,320
the sort of broader implications for for

2178
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,840
article 5 which is the beating heart of

2179
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,080
nato which is um sort of the the most

2180
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,760
essential important part of the alliance

2181
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,159
and which you know absolutely

2182
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,840
must be preserved right and so i guess

2183
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,360
that's where my

2184
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,920
concern is and so even though i

2185
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,600
understand that we like to have

2186
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,840
strategic ambiguity and respond at a

2187
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,360
time place a manner of our choosing i

2188
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,480
think it is helpful to have more clarity

2189
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,440
about um how article 5 applies to

2190
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,679
cyberspace because there is so much

2191
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,000
cyber activity right

2192
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,159
there is already you know a whole host

2193
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,560
of militia cyber activity that

2194
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,040
traditional nato adverse adversaries

2195
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,440
conduct against nato members and to

2196
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,360
undermine the cohesion of the alliance

2197
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,480
right so

2198
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,440
that ambiguity is not um

2199
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,040
i think it's not useful in this

2200
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,560
particular context

2201
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,320
but perhaps you disagree i think martin

2202
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,159
wanted to add something to this okay you

2203
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,520
see that you see the bottom bullet here

2204
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,520
this is from your briefing yes i want to

2205
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,440
creatively reread it

2206
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,280
february 20

2207
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,719
february 2022 the chief of police said

2208
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,040
we have stated that speeding can trigger

2209
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,199
a traffic ticket but we have never

2210
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,040
gotten to the position where we give the

2211
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,880
potential adversary the privilege of

2212
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,440
defining our speed limits

2213
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,210
that's exactly that

2214
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:28,800
[Applause]

2215
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,600
well some well summarized point well

2216
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,040
summarize point

2217
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,080
you should have just answered the

2218
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,080
question i took way too long that was

2219
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,639
much better

2220
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,000
john did you still have a question for

2221
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,480
us i i promised you did threatened

2222
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,239
rather that that was a great response by

2223
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:47,120
the way john solomon fsi sack

2224
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,840
when you go after a non-state baddie as

2225
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
um sorry michael was was pointing out

2226
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,920
you know trick bots or or conti the

2227
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,199
worst thing that can realistically

2228
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,800
happen is that they go underground they

2229
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,239
regroup and they resurface and you have

2230
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,520
to do it all over again it's part of

2231
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,639
life

2232
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,560
when you go after a state actor

2233
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,239
offensively they're not going to

2234
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,080
retaliate most likely it's a hardened

2235
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,000
military c4 infrastructure they're going

2236
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,239
to go after something soft and squishy

2237
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,639
like a hospital infrastructure so how do

2238
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,040
you as a state actor

2239
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,480
on the good guys doing the offensive

2240
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,400
cyber cyber operations i assume we're

2241
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,320
the good guys in here how do you

2242
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,480
understand what potential collateral

2243
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,480
damage for you know subject to

2244
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,239
retaliatory action is and how do you go

2245
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,000
about protecting that and yes i am

2246
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,520
obviously saying this as a as a

2247
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,880
representative of the private sector

2248
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,840
here

2249
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,280
you know you're you're you're small to

2250
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,679
medium enterprises your your less mature

2251
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,040
sectors are going to be very very

2252
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,560
vulnerable to state affiliated state

2253
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,239
sponsored or even state military cyber

2254
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,920
attacks how do you work with them how do

2255
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,480
you protect them

2256
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,360
was this directed at a specific panelist

2257
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,560
or you want something anybody who'd like

2258
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,840
to respond does anyone want to jump on

2259
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,360
this

2260
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,120
michael any thoughts ahead

2261
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,000
um

2262
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,159
so yeah i have thought that this

2263
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,080
question was not originally for me but

2264
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,719
uh yeah at least

2265
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,520
let's try

2266
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,199
that's a good question of course

2267
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,000
but um

2268
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,400
the

2269
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,880
i i think i don't have really a good

2270
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,800
response so maybe i'm happy yes

2271
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,920
i thought yeah go ahead erica um

2272
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,719
so okay not to like plug layered cyber

2273
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,280
deterrence again but what i like about

2274
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,120
that uh that graphic that i showed um

2275
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,159
illustrating sort of the the the role

2276
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,840
but also the limits of sort of a cost

2277
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,440
and position approach i think that's

2278
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,639
where um better coordination between the

2279
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,040
government and the private sector is

2280
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,480
important right um

2281
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,920
you know there are all these debates

2282
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,280
about you know

2283
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,920
who's responsible for securing what

2284
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,320
parts of sort of the the broad uh you

2285
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,199
know

2286
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,719
the landscape of cyberspace right but um

2287
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:01,840
you know

2288
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,760
from a u.s government perspective right

2289
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,280
there are sort of roles and

2290
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,120
responsibilities that reside within the

2291
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,080
federal government and roles and

2292
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,199
responsibilities that reside within the

2293
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:12,159
private sector i think sort of radically

2294
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:13,679
reshaping that architecture is not a

2295
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,840
good idea but i do think that you know

2296
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:16,880
this

2297
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,920
underscores the importance of improved

2298
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,280
you know i don't want to say information

2299
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,280
sharing because it's you know a phrase

2300
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,120
that we repeat ad nauseam but like

2301
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,960
meaningful collaboration between the

2302
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,239
government and the private sector

2303
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,520
particularly the owners and operators of

2304
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,960
critical infrastructure which i realize

2305
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,520
leaves out this um small to medium-sized

2306
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,040
firms most of the time that you

2307
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,600
reference um but i think that you know

2308
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,280
we've seen

2309
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,760
from a u.s perspective the federal

2310
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,239
government do a better job at sort of

2311
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,320
recognizing that challenge and

2312
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,880
recognizing that actions taken in and

2313
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,280
through cyberspace by the military for

2314
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,920
instance are not going to be perceived

2315
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,679
by the private sector and yet the

2316
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,199
private sector could suffer the

2317
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,840
consequences potentially or the response

2318
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,600
um because it's sort of the soft

2319
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,760
underbelly of of the united states and

2320
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,840
so doing a better job at sharing

2321
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,480
indicators and warnings at um improving

2322
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,800
collaboration um

2323
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,120
at um you know

2324
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,520
the department of homeland security cesa

2325
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,639
the cybersecurity infrastructure

2326
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,360
security agency within dhs has tried to

2327
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,520
sort of stand up these entities right

2328
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,120
now we have the joint cyber defense

2329
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,800
collat collaborative that's meant to be

2330
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,280
kind of a hub of collaboration to be

2331
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,600
able to sort of pass um in some

2332
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,239
instances um information that's gathered

2333
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,760
by entities within the government

2334
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,679
outside of cisa like

2335
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,320
the dod or the intelligence community to

2336
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,920
the private sector to enable them to

2337
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,679
sort of improve their own defense

2338
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,360
posture and resilience and so i think

2339
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,880
we're getting there but it is it is a

2340
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,040
concern and that's why it's tired to

2341
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,280
talk about the multi-stakeholder model

2342
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,400
and for information

2343
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,320
sharing and collaboration but i you know

2344
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,639
it's manifestly important to improve

2345
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,639
those things it's hard

2346
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,960
um it's hard to do within the united

2347
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,040
states it's even harder to do when we

2348
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,320
think about uh the reality that um the

2349
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,239
private sector is not bounded by a

2350
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,920
particular uh national or geographic uh

2351
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,600
geographic uh

2352
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,920
area uh but yeah i think the point

2353
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,679
you're raising is exactly right and i

2354
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,360
think that's why there has been um

2355
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,960
greater and greater attempts to improve

2356
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,639
collaboration i do think the challenge

2357
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,159
though is with the small to medium end

2358
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,280
size

2359
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,000
firms less the sort of the big players

2360
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
who are you know already kind of

2361
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,560
participating in these government

2362
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,639
government collaborative programs

2363
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,400
we have time for one last question

2364
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,400
question and we have an intensely eager

2365
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,000
one on the front row again with a very

2366
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,239
discreet knowledge thank you uh dr

2367
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,920
bloomberg from certainly

2368
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,159
i'm going to be practically annoying

2369
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,080
with the question so i'm going to

2370
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,760
paraphrase the question of the session

2371
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,719
is

2372
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,560
not if the offensive operation is best

2373
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,040
defense but do we actually have the

2374
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,520
capability to conduct the offensive

2375
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,719
operations as a union or as a or as an

2376
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,320
alliance now

2377
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,239
we already know that the uh we have like

2378
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,400
cyber defensive initiatives such as from

2379
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,159
the european union we have the nato

2380
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,040
rapid response team we have the united

2381
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,239
states defend and uh hunt forward but

2382
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,159
actually how do we harness this how do

2383
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,719
we harness this capability and is this

2384
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,040
actually when someone calls for help

2385
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,199
how do we call for help and will the

2386
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,960
nations who participate actually be able

2387
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,840
to contribute to active cyber defense

2388
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,440
not even talking about the offensive

2389
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,280
operations or they will say increase of

2390
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,280
crisis we're going to hold on to these

2391
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,440
capabilities i'm i'm talking about the

2392
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,199
current situation when any of the

2393
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,639
alliance neighbors

2394
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,880
allies can reach out to someone else and

2395
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,960
request this capability and this is the

2396
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,639
question to all of the panel i know this

2397
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,920
is

2398
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,520
not direct to any anyone particular

2399
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,639
thank you

2400
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,600
well we don't really have any

2401
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,360
representatives from the alliance here

2402
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,040
today but if

2403
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,280
any one of you academics

2404
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,480
from the us

2405
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
or

2406
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,239
academic researcher

2407
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:02,239
feels compelled to answer this question

2408
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,199
i'm

2409
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,480
welcome to just share your thoughts

2410
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,719
without clearly binding any countries to

2411
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,040
anything

2412
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,440
yeah let me just take a gander at this

2413
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,280
and i'll start with nuclear policy

2414
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,520
because why not right

2415
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,719
um

2416
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,199
in 1962 robert mcnamara secretary of

2417
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,920
defense tried to interest the soviets

2418
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
in separating counter force which is to

2419
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
go after their

2420
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
nuclear weapons from counter value

2421
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,840
uh

2422
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,360
in other words basically if the war

2423
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,400
starts we're going to go after your

2424
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,600
missiles we're not going to go after

2425
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600
your cities this way you don't go after

2426
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,040
our cities because you realize what's

2427
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,960
going to happen and we can settle the

2428
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,800
nuclear war with a lot fewer people

2429
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,320
being dead

2430
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,080
two problems one the soviets didn't buy

2431
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,560
it but the other problem was that the

2432
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,639
french philosophy of nuclear weapon they

2433
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,239
did not have enough nuclear weapons to

2434
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,239
do counter force they could only do

2435
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,840
counter value

2436
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,320
so it turns out that even though in

2437
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,040
conventional capability nato acted as

2438
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,000
one in terms of nuclear capability they

2439
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,360
all had separate policies and

2440
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,760
establishments

2441
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,679
same problem in cyber

2442
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,520
right we talk as if

2443
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,120
we're you know all for one and one for

2444
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,040
all and we all collaborate but you're

2445
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,280
talking as my colleague here observed

2446
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,719
about that part of the defense

2447
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,639
establishment that is most secret from

2448
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,560
other folks

2449
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,679
right and one of the ironies is that the

2450
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,320
alliance that is strongest with the

2451
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,840
united states in cyberspace is not nato

2452
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,400
it's the five eyes

2453
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,040
and two of those members are not in nato

2454
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,000
okay

2455
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,679
so

2456
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,960
you have a problem in one part one part

2457
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,360
of the party going off doing operations

2458
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,440
that the other parts

2459
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,840
other members of nato are not aware of

2460
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,840
may not have approved of may raise

2461
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,840
escalation issues

2462
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,280
that they're sort of being taken along

2463
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,520
for a ride for and being understandably

2464
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,159
upset and it works the other way if

2465
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,239
you're trying to modulate your cyber

2466
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,960
offensive cyber war activities in order

2467
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,199
to present a sort of consistent position

2468
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,920
for the purpose of escalation control

2469
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,000
and somebody from the alliance decides

2470
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,400
to carry out a cyber attack that seems

2471
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,560
to go beyond that

2472
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,400
can you count on the other side saying

2473
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,800
oh yeah this isn't the big country this

2474
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,239
is just one of the small countries that

2475
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,560
did it or will they have a tendency to

2476
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,600
say

2477
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,600
i can't tell the difference between them

2478
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,800
and frankly

2479
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,320
if i could it doesn't matter because

2480
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,239
they're all one alliance i'm going to

2481
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:33,360
respond to the worst cyber attack as

2482
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,960
having set the level of escalation in

2483
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,880
the conflict

2484
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,560
which is the question i don't know how

2485
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,760
to answer

2486
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,600
which is a good point a way that that is

2487
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,120
an excellent way to end a little bit

2488
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,360
grim and a little bit a little bit uh

2489
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,400
unclear

2490
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,239
at this point i worry slightly about

2491
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,760
keeping you guys all from the joys of

2492
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,360
talon we're also glad you could make the

2493
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,960
trip but first please join me in

2494
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,440
thanking our panelists

2495
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,199
you
