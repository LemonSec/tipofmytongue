1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,399
um so i have a quick question as people

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
are getting settled uh in in 1972 when

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
joe and ly was asked uh what he

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
he thought were the the biggest

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
ramifications of the french revolution

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
uh what what did he say

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
too soon to tell

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,039
right if you don't know the uh anecdote

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,480
uh so

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,679
february 24th 2022 uh we already know

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,000
that his had huge implications for for

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
everyone uh certainly in this room uh

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,399
but across the world uh in politics and

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,160
national security

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,200
um

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
even you know if energy security food

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,840
security

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
um you know

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
what we think about

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,000
in nation states and what they can and

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
can't do uh on on the international

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,719
stage and certainly for nato uh rather

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,199
than diminish nato nato has been

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
strengthened and nato is bigger right

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
with uh the accession of of new members

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
in the near future

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
uh so um

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
we're gonna talk about uh the cyber

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
aspects of uh of international relations

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,439
and and conflict uh with five experts

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
here uh and i couldn't be more delighted

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,159
you know or we couldn't have five better

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,119
uh panelists and so to get right into it

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,960
uh we'll start with natalya tkachuk

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
the head of information and cyber

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799

because we know that you did all what

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,360
was possible and all what was impossible

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
for ukraine to become a member of the

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
ccdcoe

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,640
also

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
we thank the ccdco team and all the

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
country members for unanimous voting for

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,520
ukraine

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,319
uh

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,560
it is very important to my country and

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
we do appreciate it a lot

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
uh so two days ago ukrainian delegation

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
for the first time took place in the

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
official meeting of the steering

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,000
committee and i hope that all the

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
technical procedures uh will not take

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
too much time and very soon ukraine

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
will become a full

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,640
nation

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,160
contributing nation to the ccdcoe

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
and for sure our contribution will be

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
beneficial to all the

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
member countries

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
because ukraine has a unique experience

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
of dealing with a cyber war

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
and we are eager to share this

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
experience with you

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
and as far as we have this experience

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,400
now we can discuss and we can make

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,599
conclusions

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,560
about the role of cyber in a modern war

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,519
and

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
i should say that taking into

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
consideration the level of ict

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
the level of the digitalization of most

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
countries in the world

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
today we cannot compare

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
potential harm from cyber attacks

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
to those deaths and casualties

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,040
from

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,480
bombing from artillery strikes

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
from using prohibited weapons against

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
ukrainian population

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
this cruelty and inhumanity of killing

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
ukrainian civil population men women

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,480
kids

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
destroying our houses destroying our

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
schools hospitals

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
raping our women and girls

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,799
and just

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,360
many other things that are being done by

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
russian soldiers all this

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
right now cannot be compared

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,360
to the results of cyber attacks

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
there's another conclusion that we made

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,519
that

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
in a modern war cyber became a very

102
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
important part of preconditioning

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
for further military invasion and if a

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
country is not ready to counter this

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
threat

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,478
then the enemy will get a great

107
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
advantage

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
but ukraine was ready

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
a few mothers before this war had

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
started we understood that something was

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
going on in a cyber sphere

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
and on 20th of january

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
we initiated and we conducted the urgent

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
meeting of the national cyber security

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,479
coordination center

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
of ukraine

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
they were the vice prime minister for

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
digital transformation the heads of the

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
security service of ukraine the head of

120
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
the intelligence body of ukraine and

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
other members

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
presented on this meeting

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
and we adopted a number of very

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,680
important decisions of strategic

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
character how to prepare ukraine for

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,199
potential cyber strikes

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,320
and at the very beginning of february we

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,479
launched a 24 hours response center

129
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
and all the representatives from the

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
main stakeholders responsible for cyber

131
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
security in ukraine the state service

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
representatives 24 hours a day

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
were monitoring cyberspace we're

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
monitoring cyber threats

140
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,199
to be able to react proactively

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,000
also we involved to this activity

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
private sector and operators of critical

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
infrastructure

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
and one week before the invasion by

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
itself we noticed a huge massive wave of

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
cyber attacks

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
uh at our critical infrastructure

148
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,199
uh these attacks were targeted to

149
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
banking sphere energy sector telecom

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
sphere satellite telecom operators

151
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,199
internet service providers

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
these attacks were very sophisticated

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
simultaneous and well coordinated

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
and only due to professional

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
work and coordinated work of

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
our main stakeholders help of

157
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
international partners and support from

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,199
our private sector we managed to deal

159
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
with this threat and the most part of

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
this attacks were detected and

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
neutralized in time so they really

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,759
didn't uh

163
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
get too much harm to ukraine's critical

164
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
infrastructure

165
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
but you just imagine what could have

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
happened if we were not able to do this

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
if ukraine

168
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,759
were not prepared if our cyber security

169
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
capacities were not developed

170
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,319
i think i suppose that at the day of

171
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,400
invasion probably

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
the electricity would be cut off

173
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
the banking sphere

174
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,199
would be paralyzed

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
people would not be able to get

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
objective proper information about what

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
was going on because the internet

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,759
service providers wouldn't be working

179
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
the general staff of armed forces also

180
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
would be paralyzed without any

181
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
communications including satellite

182
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
communications

183
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,479
and under such circumstances i think

184
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
that the aggressive country would have

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
much more chances

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,479
even to capture kiev

187
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
so that is the role of cyber security

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
in a modern war you know every day and

189
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
now

190
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,599
uh i'm thankful to ukrainian armed

191
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
forces to those men and women who every

192
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000
day risking their lives are on the front

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
edge of this terrible war but not less i

194
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
am thankful to those our cyber warriors

195
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
who where and who are protecting

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
ukraine's critical infrastructure and

197
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,319
ukraine's cyber space

198
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
and personally i would like to thank to

199
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
victor jarrah who is right now with me

200
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
on this panel because he and his

201
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
professional team

202
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
from the state service of special

203
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
communication and information protection

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
together with the team of the security

205
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,759
service of ukraine and ministry of

206
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,479
defense from the very first days were on

207
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
the front line of this cyber war

208
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
and let's call the things by their names

209
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
let's call a spade a spade

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,799
we should not talk about a war in

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,279
ukraine we should talk about war in

212
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,479
europe

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,958
started by russian federation

214
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,640
and we should not talk about cyber

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
attacks from russia

216
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
we should talk about first world cyber

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
war

218
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
that we need to be united to stand to

219
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
and to deal with this war to stand to it

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
we need to create an effective

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
international cyber coalition

222
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
so we are greatly thankful to all our

223
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
international partners for your support

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
to eu and nato countries

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
especially to the united states of

226
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,760
america

227
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
to international i.t businesses that are

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
being supporting us

229
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
to cyber volunteers all around the world

230
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
because without you

231
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
we would not be able not only to win

232
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
because i'm sure that ukraine are

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
winning this war right now but even to

234
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
survive in this war

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
so uh also

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
we're thankful for the world's community

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
for diplomatic measures that had been

238
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
taken because as you can see the

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,519
sanctions implied to russia also rather

240
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,399
weaken their possibilities for cyber

241
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
strikes

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
on 10th of may uh the ukraine the usa

243
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
and the eu

244
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
made common statement

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,560
condemning russian aggression in

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
cyberspace and attributing recent cyber

247
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,959
attacks to russia

248
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,040
so you can see that this

249
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
international cyber coalition

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
is being forming right now

251
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
so i urge

252
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
all our partners

253
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
all the democratic world

254
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,839
countries

255
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,760
businesses academia

256
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,160
cyber warriors and volunteers

257
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,320
join this coalition

258
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
stand with ukraine stand for ukraine

259
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
in the sake of safe secure and

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
transparent cyber space because only

261
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
together

262
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
we can stop

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,640
russia

264
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,840
at least in a cyber war thank you

recognition

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
of what ukraine has done uh in defending

297
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
our values in defending our

298
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
independence and sovereignty over the

299
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
last eight years

300
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,279
in fighting for

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,120
values of democracy and european values

302
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
in

303
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,760
aggression

304
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
which is provided by the russian

305
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
federation against ukraine

306
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
but it's more important and more

307
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
exciting to feel support from everybody

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
during our numerous meetings here in

309
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
tallinn during all our negotiations and

310
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
here at conference even

311
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,399
because of

312
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
colors of beige and uh a lot of

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
ukrainian flags and symbols in the city

314
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
uh thank you very much for this

315
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,720
uh with regards to the war

316
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,519
there are three versions some one says

317
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,399
that

318
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
the war began 24th of february

319
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
another version it

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
began

321
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,600
uh

322
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
in 2014 with annexation of crimea and

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
occupation in eastern part of donbass

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
somebody says that

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
it actually began four centuries ago

326
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
but with regards to cyber war we

327
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
understand that

328
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
it started

329
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,560
may

330
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,120
2014 with the attack on central election

331
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
commission and that was the first strike

332
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
in this cyber war

333
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
which uh was followed by numerous cyber

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
attacks

335
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
on ukrainian critical infrastructure

336
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,639
on power grid in 2015 and 2016

337
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,079
on ukrainian media companies on

338
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,240
ukrainian government entities

339
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
and followed by most destructive cyber

340
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,199
attack in history not beta in june 2017

341
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,079
and as natalia said uh

342
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,240
ukraine carried out lessons from these

343
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,519
cyber attacks

344
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,800
and put

345
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,959
so much attention to creating of our

346
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,120
cyber security system

347
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
in legislation in building capacities in

348
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,440
preparing workforce

349
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
and

350
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
in the middle of january

351
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
after

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,160
four years of

353
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
rather calm period without

354
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
serious

355
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,880
destructive

356
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,760
cyber attacks but

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
record in number huge number of

358
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,680
attacks which was constantly growing

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,040
we observed

360
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,560
escalation of cyber war

361
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
with the attack on ukrainian government

362
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
websites on january 14th

363
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
and then huge ddos attacks on ukrainian

364
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
banks government entities in the middle

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
of february

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,519
which was

367
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
followed by a full-scale invasion on

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
24th

369
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
and uh

370
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
we all understand that this is the first

371
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,240
time

372
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,959
in history when the conventional war is

373
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,199
combined with cyber war and cyber

374
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
operations are used to support

375
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
kinetic operation

376
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,680
and

377
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
probably in history books there will be

378
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,079
record that the cyber component of four

379
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,120
began

380
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
january 14th

381
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
and what we observe

382
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
over the last three months of

383
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
of war

384
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,040
we see that

385
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
cyber

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,519
aggression

387
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,880
supports

388
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
kinetic operation for sometimes or these

389
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,480
cyber operations can be used separately

390
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,800
to attack to target ukrainian critical

391
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
infrastructure

392
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
government entities energy sector

393
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
supply chain

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
financial sector and mostly telecom

395
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,959
sector

396
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
and ukraine was

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
very lucky

398
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,079
keeping uh the communication

399
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,519
alive

400
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,880
even on occupied territories even

401
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
despite

402
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,199
attempts of

403
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
adversary to reroute traffic

404
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
to intercept traffic of ukrainian

405
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
citizens on occupied territories to get

406
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,839
control over telecom infrastructure

407
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
including broadcasting infrastructure

408
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
and this is our day-to-day work to

409
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
prevent

410
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
these attempts and to

411
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,720
provide cyber resilience to our country

412
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
and of course that

413
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
cannot be possible

414
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
uh with the absence of uh

415
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
support

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
from

417
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
our expert community

418
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
uh showing the great uh result in

419
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,720
private public partnership

420
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,079
we

421
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
we were able to hire a lot of

422
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,800
professionals from private sector which

423
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
are helping

424
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
our country to defend

425
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
and uh we were a lot of support from

426
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
global expert community who are helping

427
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
ukraine to resist

428
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
and uh of course

429
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,839
we feel

430
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,120
uh

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,959
constant support and we provided a lot

432
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,039
of assistance from our

433
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,679
international partners from global i.t

434
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
providers

435
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,439
this

436
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,000
includes a supply of

437
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,520
hardware

438
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,720
software

439
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
threat until

440
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,000
a lot of consultancy

441
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,439
that helps ukraine to to continue

442
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,760
defending our cyberspace

443
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,799
and

444
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,599
this

445
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,160
the importance of this assistance is

446
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
hard to overestimate and we are grateful

447
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,400
for everybody who helps ukraine to uh to

448
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
defend ourselves

449
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
in cyber

450
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,640
but

451
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,280
again we we have very good examples of

452
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,679
countries

453
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,360
mainly estonia

454
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
who is a brilliant example of digital

455
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
transformation which is combined

456
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
with the cyber security with the

457
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,640
protection of information assets

458
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
and we used estonia as an example and by

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
the way

460
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520
uh a lot of uh

461
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
organizations from estonia

462
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
um

463
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
made serious contribution to to our

464
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,720
resistance to our resilience and uh we

465
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
have a lot of uh cyber security

466
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,559
exercises with cyber exert uh with uh

467
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,640
igaranis academy

468
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,240
and uh what uh we have done uh over the

469
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
last uh

470
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,280
four years or five years from not beta

471
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,320
attack

472
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
was done together with our partners from

473
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
the united states

474
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,919
usaid projects with the european

475
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,039
commission

476
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
eu for digital uh many many other

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
projects which help ukraine get this

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
capacity

479
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,960
and uh

480
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
we are lucky that uh roman berchuk from

481
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,320
he have joined us he was the person

482
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
who started building cyber protection

483
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
capacities

484
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
in ukraine and obviously this is the key

485
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
factor that help us

486
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,240
to

487
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
continue be resilient

488
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
and if we

489
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
succeed in

490
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,919
defending ukraine in cyberspace and our

491
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,520
armed forces

492
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
will succeed

493
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
on the battlefields

494
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,000
i believe that we'll be able to stop

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
this aggression with the help of our

496
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
partners

497
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
uh since ukraine is not defending only

498
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,120
our territory our land will defending

499
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
all

500
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
europe will defend we are defending all

501
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,799
uh civilized world against this uh

502
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,240
unprovoked

503
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
unprecedented aggression from russia

504
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
federation and

505
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,400
of course i believe ukraine will prevail

506
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,980
thank you so much

507

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,280
kiev ukraine's capital uh in our country

523
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,159
there is a martial law in place

524
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
therefore not everyone

525
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039
is able to travel abroad uh only

526
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,480
officials

527
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,039
uh and i am ahead of the board of the

528
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
ukrainian ngo

529
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,280
international cyber security university

530
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
which supports the cyber security

531
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,919
related process in public institution of

532
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,039
ukraine

533
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,320
as well as engaged in analysis and

534
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,000
research

535
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
also i was the head of a state center

536
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,360
for cyber protection from 2016 that time

537
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,400
i first met kenneth in kiev

538
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,960
until 2019

539
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
when we had

540
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
presidential and parliament election in

541
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
our country

542
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,039
this period ukraine was subjected to a

543
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,440
series of very powerful cyber attacks

544
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
including

545
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,919
attacks on

546
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
energy sector black energy

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
governmental agency and business are

548
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
better

549
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
and we have to start very actively

550
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
to enforce our cybersecurity

551
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
capabilities and i'm also very glad that

552
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
victor jorah is present today here in

553
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
this panel he provided great assistance

554
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
in building ukrainians

555
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,919
cyber defense those times

556
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,480
since february war in our countries that

557
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
in fact

558
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,159
less from 2015

559
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
faced completely face uh

560
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
direct military invasion

561
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,799
since beginning of this phase we uh in

562
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,919
india watched very closely the events in

563
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
cyberspace in particular

564
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,400
and very interesting situation that rose

565
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
due to a desire of many volunteers from

566
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
around the world

567
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,640
to support ukraine in its efforts to

568
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,799
protect the integrity

569
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,440
and our people to protect our freedom

570
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
independence and democracy and this

571
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
seems to be a

572
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,200
very first world experience of so many

573
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,919
people from all over the world in white

574
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,840
sided actions

575
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,799
observing the situation uh through

576
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
information from a large number of

577
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
sources

578
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,120
we have formed some initial thoughts

579
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,320
and

580
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,039
while having big attacking capabilities

581
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,000
russian

582
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
defense capabilities have been

583
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
overestimated

584
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
the result could be seen in the first

585
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
month of russian invasion

586
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,720
a huge amount of resources both from

587
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
russia and belarusia were so-called

588
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
lukanski and the next republic were

589
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
disabled defaced and hacked

590
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
while russian military or some

591
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
governmental

592
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
resources had some protection most

593
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,280
commercial and other governmental

594
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
resources has extremely low levels of

595
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
protection

596
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
russian hackers have attacked objects uh

597
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,840
that

598
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,480
other countries consider either un

599
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
interesting or unethical no matter how

600
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,280
strange they may sound

601
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
um usually worldwide

602
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,360
and hack explicit goals to seize

603
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,600
information for sales or just to make

604
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
money in some rare cases targets are

605
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
simply the ambitions of attackers while

606
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
russians oftenly use cyber attacks and

607
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
reinforcement for political

608
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
informational military operations that

609
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
radically changed the list of targets in

610
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
methods of attacks

611
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,240
if you look around the modern attack

612
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
landscape you will see that

613
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
type of operation usually attributes it

614
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,360
to russians

615
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,000
this happened before as an example not

616
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
peter is known all over the world if you

617
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
remember

618
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,840
during that attack

619
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,559
directors were using ransomware that was

620
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,480
discovered few years ago

621
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
very different way

622
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
to destroy critical information and to

623
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,200
eliminate all these traces this caused a

624
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,919
huge impact in various sectors of

625
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
economy and supposed to create a panic

626
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
other example

627
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,960
in attacks of ukrainian treasury a

628
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
ministry of finance that happened in the

629
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
end of 2016.

630
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
the time by destruction of system in

631
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
these agencies russians intend to impact

632
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
all the end year payments

633
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
therefore uh

634
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
realizing that specific uh in the work

635
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
of russian cyber criminals was bold must

636
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,679
prepare

637
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,159
for other protection schemes

638
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
also we must prepare for the fact

639
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
that before russian where

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
restraints are limited by certain

641
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,279
international agreements of rules in the

642
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,200
field of cyber attacks

643
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
now they will no longer have these

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
restrictions they will act more

645
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,799
aggressively

646
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,279
and they will definitely attack because

647
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,919
they have been developing this type of

648
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,279
operation

649
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,279
for a long time have a governmental

650
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,559
support

651
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,440
and already has a large capacity

652
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,840
the protection of russian country-wide

653
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
network only on the level of external

654
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,360
connection has shown some effectiveness

655
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
especially in terms of protection

656
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
against ddos attack but they are

657
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
external connection protection

658
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
systems designed not just for ddos

659
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,720
protection but also has a dpi

660
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,159
capabilities

661
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
this makes russian network

662
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
as isolated from the world as in china

663
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
it will affect availability of

664
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
information inside the country

665
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,279
and

666
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,480
consequently freedom of will

667
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,640
and this approach demonstrates a new

668
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,440
look at the locally separated national

669
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
network

670
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,279
the first example of such a network was

671
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,919
a step shoot established in china

672
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,640
years ago

673
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,120
and now russia also reached this

674
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,440
approach however it's very important

675
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
that these technical capabilities can be

676
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
achieved today only with equipment and

677
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,200
technology from a global manufacturer

678
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,279
only partial management and control of

679
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,000
traffic without them as possible

680
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
while china has its own manufacturing

681
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,240
capabilities russian network protection

682
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
relies mostly on western equipment and

683
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
technology

684
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,919
these aspects makes us rethink regular

685
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,480
breadth model on country level

686
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
and it is very important that ukraine

687
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,679
have abilities to participate ccdc oe

688
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,480
activities and i would like to thank you

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,960
to see the coe and all the nato member

690
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
states for your great support of ukraine

691
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
in our fight for freedom

692
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,610
thank you very much

693
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:20,240
[Applause]

694
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
so russia may achieve some tactical

695
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
successes on the battlefield but i think

696
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,399
that from a strategic perspective

697
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
political military

698
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,520
uh

699
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,440
cyber moral

700
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
it's been a failure

701
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
right february 24th and beyond and

702
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
um and one of the

703
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,320
most obvious examples of of that is in

704
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
nato how nato has not been diminished

705
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,159
but strengthened and today we're

706
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,279
fortunate

707
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,960
to have uh katrina kendall in here from

708
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,000
finland from the op group in the ssh

709
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,960
communications security cooperation

710
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
to tell us a little bit more about uh

711
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
finland's perspective uh on

712
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
these events thank you

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
thank you and thank you also for

714
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
inviting me to come back to cycon it's

715
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,279
wonderful to be here although we are

716
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
living in in tragical times

717
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,399
although cyber operations in a military

718
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,799
context is nothing new the ongoing war

719
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,279
in ukraine is probably the first time

720
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,360
that the cyber domain has been used to

721
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,279
such an extent in a full-scale

722
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,880
conventional war

723
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
of course the cyber attacks have

724
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,440
naturally preceded the kinetic attacks

725
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
and this is probably going to be a new

726
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,080
normal so in any war conflict now and in

727
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,399
the future the cyber element will be

728
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
present

729
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but also as a result of russia's

730
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
invasion of ukraine the discussion of a

731
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
nato membership in for finland and also

732
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,320
for sweden took a whole new turn

733
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,960
and as you probably know finland has a 1

734
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,840
300 kilometer long border with russia we

735
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
have been fighting wars with russia 80

736
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,600
years ago

737
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
i am still a generation that has

738
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,559
grandparents who were fighting the war

739
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,799
we still have war veterans

740
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,720
alive although they are getting fewer by

741
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,520
the number so we have been growing up

742
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
with the threat that has now been

743
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,440
realized in ukraine and this is

744
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
something that we feel very deeply also

745
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
in finland and we feel for ukraine and

746
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,399
the ukrainian people

747
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,200
so this has affected the nato discussion

748
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,399
in finland and in only three months time

749
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,520
two traditionally military unaligned

750
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
nations discussed decided and applied

751
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
for nato membership

752
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
and in finland the support for nato

753
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
membership is now over 70 percent from

754
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
having been only a little bit more than

755
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,240
20 percent

756
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
uh of course it was expected that as a

757
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,960
result of the discussion and and also

758
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
the decision that russia would conduct

759
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
hybrid operations towards us including

760
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,320
cyber operations and information

761
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,919
operations

762
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,080
so as a result we raised our

763
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
preparedness not only for the military

764
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
but in the whole of society for example

765
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
the critical infrastructures have raised

766
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,840
the the preparedness and expecting that

767
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,880
something might happen to them

768
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,919
also

769
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
the everyday all the humans the or the

770
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,200
population has raised their awareness so

771
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,640
people are encouraged to have a 72 hour

772
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,080
basic needs at home so food water and

773
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
and so on

774
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,679
so in case something would happen then

775
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,279
they would cope until the whole

776
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,760
preparedness organization gets its

777
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,720
wheels going

778
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,679
of course information operations is not

779
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
a new phenomena for us either i mean our

780
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
nato discussion has been affected for

781
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
for decades and it has been kind of

782
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
um nato has been portrayed as something

783
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
it is not and there's been kind of these

784
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,880
false misconceptions that then in your

785
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
conscripts have to go and fight the wars

786
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
of the united states which is of course

787
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,480
not not true

788
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760
but there has been a lot of

789
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
misinformation about nato and what

790
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
joining nato would mean

791
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,320
but we were still expecting more

792
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,919
aggressive rhetoric now that the

793
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,320
discussion started and rightly so we

794
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,440
were experienced things so for example

795
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,919
russia threatened us that they will

796
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
respond they also claim that they're

797
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,799
joining nato will have military

798
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,360
consequences for for finland

799
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,519
there are fake pictures spreading about

800
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,000
russia moving for example military

801
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,559
materiel closer to the borders of

802
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,399
finland

803
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
and when president silenski addressed

804
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
the finnish parliament

805
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,919
one thing we saw was for example

806
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,000
violation of our airspace well this is

807
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
nothing new they have been violating it

808
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,240
before but this was very much timed with

809
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,320
the presidency

810
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
speak or talk to our parliament

811
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,159
and we also saw cyber operations that

812
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
actually could be more be classified as

813
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
information operations they were denial

814
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,799
of service attacks that were targeted on

815
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,799
the on the

816
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,640
ministry of defense and ministry of

817
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
foreign affairs and this was also during

818
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,120
solenski's talk

819
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
they made the headlines so they kind of

820
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
gave the impression and now there is

821
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,360
some aggression going on from russia's

822
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,200
side but they had no real impact so it

823
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,760
has absolutely zero impact on the

824
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,360
finnish defense forces and their

825
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,080
operational capabilities

826
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,760
but other than that when looking at

827
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
cyberspace the situation has been or

828
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,919
remained calm too much to our surprise

829
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
at least so far

830
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
but we maintain our preparedness so some

831
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,039
things that we are expecting

832
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
well first of all cyber

833
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
operations as information operations

834
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
that we already saw one example of

835
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,200
another thing could be cyber operation

836
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,440
for the purpose of getting money just a

837
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,840
little bit like north korea is doing so

838
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,240
in order to support their own

839
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
development of ballistic missiles and

840
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,519
nuclear arms they are reverting to cyber

841
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,720
crime to get money to fund that a third

842
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
thing could be sabotaged so just to

843
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,559
annoy us or take out some revenge for

844
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,519
our decision or show some discontent we

845
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,679
could expect for example wiper

846
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
operations or something like that but of

847
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,760
course the worst case scenario would be

848
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,000
that there would be a large scale attack

849
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
on our critical infrastructure on which

850
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,600
the whole of our society depends

851
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,159
that could mean that russia and their

852
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,000
intelligence would already have been

853
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,720
residing in our system for years before

854
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,519
this

855
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,679
and kind of prepared the battlefield so

856
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,679
that if and when needed they could

857
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,600
launch a full-scale attack on our

858
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
critical infrastructures

859
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,279
so far we haven't seen this but we

860
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
remain prepared but of course this race

861
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,840
is also the question that what does it

862
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
mean to defend the sovereignty of a

863
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
nation also in cyberspace

864
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,960
so if we think of the logic that a

865
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
large-scale attack could be considered

866
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,519
an armed attack if its effects and

867
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,079
implications are similar to that one

868
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
then that would give the nation the

869
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,159
right already to defend itself

870
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,079
but that would require quite a few

871
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
things first of all attribution you need

872
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
to have both the technical skills but

873
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,520
also the political will to attribute

874
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,040
we need to discuss

875
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,440
countermeasures what are they what could

876
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,560
they be diplomacy sanctions

877
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
military

878
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,480
responses anything in between

879
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
so kind of to keep the toolbox open

880
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
also situational awareness across

881
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
society not only the authorities of

882
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
course the military is is having a

883
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,480
situational awareness the cyber security

884
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
center is having the police is having

885
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
but so do the critical infrastructure

886
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,918
owners and the private sector so how do

887
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,280
we combine all of this to have a

888
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
national cyber situational awareness

889
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,639
picture

890
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
there needs to be operational leadership

891
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
so we can't sit and wait that when

892
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,240
something happens then we start to

893
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,800
figure out how to to do this this has to

894
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,119
be in place and exercised of course the

895
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
legislation needs to be in place and the

896
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,240
international collaboration because

897
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,440
well

898
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,560
one country cannot fight cyber attacks

899
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,079
alone

900
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,040
but the question is of course that

901
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,240
if is the rhetoric that if you attack us

902
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
through cyberspace then we will we will

903
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,640
respond is that enough for deterrence

904
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
maybe maybe not

905
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
anyway the cyber domain is going to be

906
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,200
the new normal and we will remain our

907
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,280
preparedness and see what will happen

908
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
during this membership process

909
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
and i don't know if and when finland

910
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,160
will eventually join nato but of course

911
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,330
i'm hoping it will be soon thank you

912
00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:01,200
[Applause]

913
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
so you know what they say about las

914
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
vegas is that what happens in vegas

915
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,359
stays in vegas right and that's supposed

916
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,720
to be a good thing

917
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,440
um what happens unfortunately in moscow

918
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,040
doesn't seem to stay in moscow but it

919
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,320
reverberates out to georgia and ukraine

920
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
and transinistria

921
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,160
and estonia

922
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
and so

923
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
even as moscow fails in its uh current

924
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
invasion other authoritarian nations are

925
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,040
watching as far away as china and north

926
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
korea and elsewhere to try and learn

927
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,000
from moscow's mistakes to do better and

928
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
so you know we really need to think

929
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
about the implications uh from the big

930
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,359
picture

931
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,079
uh for for the future for the planet uh

932
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,400
for europe for nato and

933
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
to help us uh get there is the author of

934
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,599
the moscow rules uh

935
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
care giles from the russia and eurasia

936
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,560
program at chatham house

937
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,640
thank you kenneth good morning everybody

938
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,119
kenneth asked me to draw some lessons

939
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,040
observed on the basis of placing what

940
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,440
we've seen happening in ukraine in the

941
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,320
context of having watched russia prepare

942
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
for this war for the last decade and a

943
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,560
half which has been my job for most of

944
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,240
that time which of course doesn't mean

945
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
that i got some things

946
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,480
right i saw some of them just as wrong

947
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
as some of the people who suddenly

948
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
became instant experts on the russian

949
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,839
military in january of this year

950
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,320
but we can see some things that russia

951
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
wanted to do and actually succeeded in

952
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
doing in ukraine that that's where we

953
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
get the lessons for what might come next

954
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,800
for other people it's been really

955
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,680
interesting to watch the differences

956
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,440
between how russia has conducted its

957
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
conventional military campaign

958
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
and what it's been doing in the

959
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,560
information domain including cyber

960
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
because so many of russia's early

961
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
conventional failures were as a result

962
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,400
of launching a war that was different

963
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,480
from the one that they had trained and

964
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,800
organized and equipped for partly on the

965
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,560
basis of expecting that they were going

966
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
to be greeted with flowers not javelins

967
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,160
but for a whole lot of other reasons as

968
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,359
well but

969
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,440
in information and cyber

970
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,760
they did do what they actually set out

971
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,000
to do and they've been practicing what

972
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,640
we've been observed them trialling since

973
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,839
2008 with an acceleration since 2014 and

974
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,800
that is a key reason why there has been

975
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,119
not greater success by russia in

976
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,200
achieving what they wanted to do

977
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
all of the different elements that

978
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,400
russia treated as important in

979
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,200
prosecuting an information and cyber war

980
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,640
we've documented

981
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,560
not least through papers that have been

982
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,480
released through previous iterations

983
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,119
here at cycon we've watched them try it

984
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,960
out and so we know what they thought

985
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
they wanted to do

986
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,400
and that's across all of those

987
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,560
integrated domains that russia thinks

988
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,079
are part of a seamless hole when

989
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,720
prosecuting information operations

990
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,960
that's the technical cyber aspect that's

991
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,599
targeting connectivity that's the impact

992
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,079
on the cognitive domain for tactical or

993
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,640
operational or strategic effect across

994
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,160
the whole of them

995
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
russia attempted to use its expected

996
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,400
methods of information warfare in open

997
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,119
conflict over and above the ongoing

998
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,800
campaigns that natalia outlined that

999
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
were happening before the actual start

1000
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
of the invasion

1001
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,839
there was information interdiction we

1002
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,520
hear a lot about the viasat hack but we

1003
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
need to place that in the context of a

1004
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,119
much broader campaign against

1005
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,880
communications infrastructure against

1006
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,920
media using both cyber and kinetic means

1007
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
to try to make sure that ukraine can't

1008
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
communicate with its citizens

1009
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,480
because russia after the experience of

1010
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,000
crimea thought that this was a

1011
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
war-winning tool

1012
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
we've seen personalized targeted

1013
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
deception on a mass basis delivered to

1014
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
connected devices and cyber supported

1015
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,720
influence and deception operations

1016
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,200
we've seen the campaign against critical

1017
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,280
infrastructure in a direct parallel to

1018
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,680
what russia's conventional military has

1019
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,880
been doing

1020
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
hammering the ukrainian economy through

1021
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
targeting its infrastructure hammering

1022
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,280
humanitarian facilities because russia

1023
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,599
thinks that triggering humanitarian

1024
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,560
crises is how you win a war

1025
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,839
and then of course

1026
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,440
that supports the presumption that we

1027
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,000
had 10 years ago when russia was pushing

1028
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,720
for regulation in cyberspace that when

1029
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,480
they were asking for

1030
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,160
specifications of critical

1031
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,599
infrastructure facilities or

1032
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,920
humanitarian facilities that should be

1033
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
off limits for cyber conflict what they

1034
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
were actually asking for was a target

1035
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,079
list

1036
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,440
and then of course the attempted

1037
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
integration of kinetic and cyber power

1038
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,359
that we've heard victor talk about

1039
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
already so they acted as planned but

1040
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
they failed in so many ways but for

1041
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
different reasons again than the

1042
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,760
conventional military operations

1043
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,160
they missed the boat in so many ways in

1044
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,400
terms of information operations

1045
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,640
if you take as a case study the deep

1046
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,119
fake the rather crude deep fake of

1047
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,720
president zielenski in the middle of

1048
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,079
march calling for surrender and attempts

1049
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,160
by russia to disseminate that as widely

1050
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,640
as possible within ukraine it was way

1051
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
too late

1052
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,240
not only too late since the start of the

1053
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,680
war but actually too late by years

1054
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,240
because deep fakes as a political

1055
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,160
influence tool

1056
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,359
are gone and passed because even as late

1057
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,000
as long ago as 2019 and the the

1058
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
neighboring center of excellence here in

1059
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,560
riga we were writing about how the time

1060
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,119
for maximum impact of deep fake videos

1061
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,800
had already passed because they were

1062
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,400
familiar and everybody knew what they

1063
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,000
were so it had close to zero impact and

1064
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
also the long testing of all of these

1065
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,160
tools has allowed victims and

1066
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,319
adversaries of russia to learn to

1067
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,280
prepare

1068
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
to adapt

1069
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
in the case of calls for surrender

1070
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,640
apparently from the national leader

1071
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,480
we've had so long to adapt that those

1072
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,520
are built into the crisis preparedness

1073
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
booklets that are distributed to the

1074
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
civilian population in countries like

1075
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,560
sweden and latvia

1076
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,520
this will happen don't believe it

1077
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,599
and on an operational level that's cyber

1078
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,440
kinetic integration there have been

1079
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,000
marginal successes but strategically it

1080
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,680
seems to have encountered the same

1081
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,760
failure to date as russia's military

1082
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
campaign

1083
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,760
the reason of course is that russia

1084
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,119
fails

1085
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,119
when it is has an adversary that is

1086
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,520
prepared and determined

1087
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
and that has come as something of a

1088
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,240
surprise to some of my colleagues in the

1089
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,839
academic community particularly those

1090
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,440
who focus on international relations

1091
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,640
that we're not expecting that to happen

1092
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,319
it's the value of fighting back and

1093
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,240
having an active defense yesterday we

1094
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,440
heard from yakutari and of his

1095
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,359
experience of talking to ukrainian

1096
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,319
officers complaining about having had to

1097
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,240
fight for eight years with one arm tied

1098
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,400
behind their back that's no longer the

1099
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,520
case

1100
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,680
and another key difference ukraine of

1101
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,720
course unlike russia has friends in the

1102
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,560
fight as we've been hearing throughout

1103
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,960
the whole of this week not just that

1104
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,119
state support but also the private

1105
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
sector private enterprise that has a

1106
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,599
vested interest in protecting against

1107
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,319
this kind of effect and also has made a

1108
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,640
clear values choice because there is a

1109
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,680
clear right and wrong in this conflict

1110
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,920
again that support across all of these

1111
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,119
domains

1112
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,560
the technical attacks that have been

1113
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,119
prevented or mitigated by by microsoft

1114
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,839
and by mandiant or by many more the

1115
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,520
communications interdiction that's been

1116
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,960
mitigated by

1117
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,280
spacex with starlink

1118
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
and private sector bringing in the

1119
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,240
capabilities that government cannot

1120
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,000
but also governments providing that

1121
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,240
critical support and particularly in the

1122
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,960
information warfare that is around

1123
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,160
ukraine not inside ukraine countering

1124
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
that russian strategic information

1125
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,640
campaign that was designed to prepare

1126
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,760
for war getting national level support

1127
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,440
the intelligence disclosures from

1128
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,000
primarily the u.s and the uk ahead of

1129
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
the war not only preparing the general

1130
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
public not only heading off specific

1131
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,200
initiatives by russia that then didn't

1132
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
take place but also making sure that the

1133
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,800
narratives fell flat among

1134
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,680
the people who vote for leaders in

1135
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,079
western countries

1136
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
and making sure that russia at least in

1137
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
the euro-atlantic space did not achieve

1138
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
the justification for the war that it

1139
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
was hoping to and governments and the eu

1140
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,680
no matter how much they didn't want to

1141
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,599
believe it was going to happen

1142
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,680
nevertheless weren't taken by surprise

1143
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,599
by the invasion and didn't start yet

1144
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,000
again with a blank sheet of paper with

1145
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
policy options for dealing with russia

1146
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,920
at the top as has happened so many times

1147
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,520
before

1148
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,440
so yes there have been successes but

1149
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,200
successes also bring some challenges and

1150
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,960
just as in conventional military

1151
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,599
operations there's a risk of becoming

1152
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,680
the victim of success

1153
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,079
in terms of succumbing to excessive

1154
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
optimism and complacency and here i'm

1155
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,839
not talking about the people who are

1156
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,359
fighting the fight

1157
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,599
whether it's at a keyboard or in a

1158
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,359
trench outside sierra donetsk i'm

1159
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,599
talking about among the general public

1160
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,839
with less of an understanding of what is

1161
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,880
happening and once again among their

1162
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,720
elected leaders who are sensitive to the

1163
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
same information flows as they are

1164
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
because there is a public perception

1165
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,200
that nothing is happening

1166
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
that there is no cyber war

1167
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,119
non-specialist media are still wondering

1168
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,280
aloud why it is not happening or as one

1169
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,960
of our academic colleagues would say why

1170
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,599
cyber war is not taking place

1171
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,440
there is a great deal more work to be

1172
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,240
done to get the message across outside

1173
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,000
this bubble here

1174
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
that actually there is a fight going on

1175
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,240
and not only that

1176
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,280
but that it takes resources energy hard

1177
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,040
work preparation

1178
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,359
it's a reflection of this common problem

1179
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,240
that a cyber attack isn't perceived at

1180
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
all unless it succeeds

1181
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,079
and unless there is collateral damage

1182
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
other than that it is completely

1183
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,280
invisible to the population at large

1184
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
the fellow greybeards in the audience

1185
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,400
will remember

1186
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
white uk

1187
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
and the massive effort that went into

1188
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,520
mitigating that problem

1189
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
and the way that success in mitigating

1190
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,359
it was rewarded by the public perception

1191
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,280
that actually it hadn't been a problem

1192
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,720
in the first place because it didn't

1193
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,599
happen

1194
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,200
we're in danger of succumbing to the

1195
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,680
same situation again now so it's

1196
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,920
absolutely vital to deliver the message

1197
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
that success

1198
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,599
in defense in the future

1199
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,760
is going to take the same amount of

1200
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,720
expenditure and preparation

1201
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,880
but there's one even more substantial

1202
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,119
risk here as well as a result of success

1203
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,359
if we focus on successes in the

1204
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,000
immediate operations and in the ongoing

1205
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
temporary information war in and around

1206
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,400
ukraine we forget that not only cyber

1207
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
can't win the war alone possibly even

1208
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,400
military success won't win the war alone

1209
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,839
because russia can and those use other

1210
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,240
information warfare means for strategic

1211
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,280
effect over decades-long time spans not

1212
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,280
temporary within ukraine

1213
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,920
to erode and to undermine the essential

1214
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,240
support for ukraine that it needs in

1215
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,560
order to continue to fight the war and

1216
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,960
to win not military support in terms of

1217
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,359
weapons deliveries but economic

1218
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,319
humanitarian most of all political that

1219
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,800
is absolutely essential and the problem

1220
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,119
we see there is with this long

1221
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,280
preparation that russia has had and the

1222
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,960
intensive efforts in trying to get the

1223
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,440
west into a mindset where it will not

1224
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,200
oppose russia

1225
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,400
we see so many phrases and ideas and

1226
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,640
narratives that originated in russian

1227
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,839
tools of influences

1228
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,920
the western political debate and being

1229
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,400
repeated verbatim by western political

1230
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,520
leaders decision makers even very

1231
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,160
depressingly service chiefs

1232
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,720
and the main theme that's relevant here

1233
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,839
is the one of self-deterrence by western

1234
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,960
countries the way in some countries

1235
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,599
the avoidance of escalation with russia

1236
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,680
has been elevated to the status of a

1237
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,800
fetish

1238
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,280
and is driving absolutely every policy

1239
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,599
decision when it comes to supporting

1240
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,280
ukraine

1241
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,440
so my last message would be that yes

1242
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,359
russia has suffered tactical and

1243
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,400
operational reverses in cyber terms as

1244
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,440
well as it has in military terms but

1245
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
strategically and over the long term

1246
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,319
it has not lost the war and there is far

1247
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,559
more work to be done

1248
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,720

certain cities or areas in ukraine that

1276

of course

1289
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
having access to minds and uh having the

1290
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,680
possibility to change

1291
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,160
the uh

1292
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,800
um situation in information sphere on

1293
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,960
occupied territories is a primary focus

1294
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,720
of russian federation

1295
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,440
and uh we were aware of their attempts

1296
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,559
to

1297
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,400
uh to take control over the telecom

1298
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,160
infrastructure in the occupied

1299
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,319
territories and they basically started

1300
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,359
from

1301
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,040
uh from getting control over

1302
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
broadcasting infrastructure that is

1303
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,119
happening her song

1304
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,599
and uh this happened in mali topple and

1305
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,599
many other cities

1306
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,240
so around uh

1307
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,319
seven eight uh broadcasting centers and

1308
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,440
tv towers and this was done very quickly

1309
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,599
so they focused on this and they

1310
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,319
were ready to

1311
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,240
to reconfigure the equipment uh within

1312
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,440
uh

1313
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,760
10 20 hours

1314
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,200
in order to

1315
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,119
gain this coverage of

1316
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,160
of their table channels and radio

1317
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,359
stations

1318
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,119
so in propaganda on these occupied

1319
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,440
territories

1320
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
for the long time

1321
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,359
we tried to keep our ukrainian national

1322
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,040
telecom infrastructure alive on these

1323
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,839
territories and

1324
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,160
there was signs of rerouting so we

1325
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,240
observed this activity this illegal

1326
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,319
activity but

1327
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,880
yesterday uh it happened that uh most of

1328
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,160
uh uh hassan region uh was rooted

1329
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,960
through uh ros tricom and uh uh of

1330
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,240
course

1331
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,680
this is a

1332
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,440
violation of uh

1333
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,400
any uh international laws and

1334
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,240
we addressed to the

1335
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,599
itu uh regarding this issue of course

1336
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,319
uh what what uh what we can do

1337
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,720
we we can uh

1338
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,880
continue our efforts in building of

1339
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,160
brazilian infrastructure for

1340
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
broadcasting of ukrainian tv signal

1341
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,920
uh of trying to get back the control

1342
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,160
over these telecom infrastructures and i

1343
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,480
understand that if you have an access to

1344
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,680
equipment you

1345
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,000
you have credentials you can reconfigure

1346
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
it and then

1347
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,640
reroute the traffic through

1348
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,920
to russian interception systems and

1349
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,480
for obvious focused reasons

1350
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,920
but

1351
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
again we understand that information

1352
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,559
warfare is part of this hybrid war and

1353
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,440
uh

1354
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,359
this legal activity from russia will be

1355
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,400
continued but uh nevertheless uh uh we

1356
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,839
will concentrate on uh countering uh

1357
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,760
these uh these issues

1358
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,800
and uh

1359
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,200
hopefully we'll find new approaches how

1360
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,800
to how to deal with these absolutely uh

1361
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,880
new challenges for for our country

1362
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,720
i would like to add also if i may

1363
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,359
uh so i should say that really in a

1364
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,040
modern war uh

1365
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,920
those

1366
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
who control the

1367
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,000
information sphere

1368
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,960
uh

1369
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,319
have great advantage and that was the uh

1370
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,599
tactics of russia in 2014

1371
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,680
when they invaded part of the nietzsche

1372
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,079
and luganska oblast and

1373
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,040
they

1374
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,359
it was an annexation of crimea

1375
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,280
the first thing that they've they had

1376
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,680
done they captured the broadcasting

1377
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,760
facilities there

1378
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,880
they totally turned off ukrainian tv

1379
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,640
channels and

1380
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,079
put on

1381
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,040
russia and belarusia tv

1382
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,839
and

1383
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,359
they cut off also the uh ukrainian

1384
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,760
internet broadcasting

1385
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,839
so they created information blacketta uh

1386
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,880
there

1387
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,280
these territories and you know what are

1388
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,200
the consequences

1389
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,720
so they are doing

1390
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,200
the same thing right now

1391
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,400
and

1392
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,720
it's more than 20 broadcasting

1393
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,280
facilities of ukraine that are being

1394
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,640
captured

1395
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,400
or destroyed by russian troops

1396
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,520
so they do basically the same

1397
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
uh they are broadcasting russian

1398
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,720
channels

1399
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,760
to the territories of ukraine

1400
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,040
but the thing is that

1401
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,599
they do broadcast

1402
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,839
a russian tv

1403
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,839
through the satellites

1404
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,599
of our european partners

1405
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,480
and that is the problem

1406
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,359
and we asked the european union to help

1407
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,599
us with this

1408
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,160
we asked the french government

1409
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,599
to support us

1410
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
for russia to stop

1411
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,440
their business

1412
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,960
with french satellite operator

1413
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,680
you have to assad company

1414
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,200
and there were three russian

1415
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,920
broadcasting companies that went under

1416
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,440
sanctions

1417
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,839
but these russian companies

1418
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,000
they were broadcasting like an

1419
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,599
international television in foreign

1420
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,760
languages they were broadcasting on the

1421
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,079
territories of european union

1422
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,799
and of course this is a good step

1423
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,880
the european union started active

1424
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,319
measures to fight with russian

1425
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,680
propaganda

1426
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,000
but it didn't really much help ukraine

1427
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,960
because still russian channels are being

1428
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,079
translated through french satellite

1429
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,880
to our occupied territories

1430
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,280
and we are waiting

1431
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,559
for a third package of sanctions

1432
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,720
and we hope that

1433
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,720
more broadcasting and trust and

1434
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
television

1435
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,000
subjects

1436
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,640
are included in this package

1437
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,960
thank you

1438
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,799
okay next question right

1439
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:55,920
there

1440
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,960
good morning uh paul oceana netherlands

1441
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,240
defense academy um i've got a question

1442
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,920
to i guess

1443
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,359
care

1444
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,240
thanks for the excellent presentations

1445
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,920
and i was wondering

1446
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,559
about an adjacent field of

1447
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,440
military operations electronic warfare

1448
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,680
and operations in the electromagnetic

1449
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,040
spectrum

1450
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,160
closely connected or adjacent to

1451
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,559
cyberspace operations

1452
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,240
as you said

1453
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,680
if if we don't notice the operations

1454
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,280
people tend to think that they didn't

1455
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
happen right

1456
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,520
so

1457
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,960
in my view

1458
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,799
we've been researching this uh in the

1459
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,160
netherlands as well

1460
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,960
uh we haven't seen much of ew operations

1461
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,760
too

1462
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,079
could you elite a little bit on on that

1463
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,760
issue please

1464
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,520
certainly i'm very concerned that you

1465
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,760
detected precisely the 30 seconds of my

1466
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,680
prepared comments that i deleted to hit

1467
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,160
10 minutes

1468
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,040
yes it is another example of the

1469
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,799
impression that nothing is happening but

1470
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,319
it's a slightly different one and now we

1471
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,359
do see some reasons why russia's ew

1472
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,599
capability that was supposed to be so

1473
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,240
formidable has not played a visible

1474
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,000
appreciable role in this conflict such

1475
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,079
as for example again the overconfidence

1476
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,920
sending forward

1477
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,400
files of armor without their supporting

1478
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,200
elements like for example ew

1479
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,760
but on the other hand the the failure

1480
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,920
then to follow up once they realize the

1481
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,000
nature of the conflict and bring into

1482
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,480
play their ew capabilities

1483
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,400
is one of those mysteries about the war

1484
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,160
that we will only find out when the

1485
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,520
history books are written and the

1486
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,599
classified archives are open

1487
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,480
it's

1488
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,920
as though some ally of ukraine had some

1489
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,079
means of holding those capabilities at

1490
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,400
risk and presenting them functioning but

1491
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,480
of course we who operate in the open

1492
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,559
sources domain cannot possibly speculate

1493
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,640
what or how that might be

1494
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
all we see is that it is one of the

1495
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,440
things that russia thinks is important

1496
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,839
and ought to have been doing but simply

1497
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,599
hasn't appeared at least not in ways

1498
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,680
that we can see it happening so uh there

1499
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,040
are no doubt people in this room who

1500
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,119
know far more about precisely why that

1501
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,839
is happening than i do

1502
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,359
indeed

1503
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,160
just here on the left

1504
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
matthias caldwell german cyber reserve

1505
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,400
i

1506
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,559
had a specific interest

1507
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,280
in this very innovative way you

1508
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,839
raised support through

1509
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,559
the call for uh via the telegram group

1510
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,240
for uh you collected i think about 250

1511
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,960
000 people from all over the world

1512
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,319
helping you in in the cyber war

1513
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,640
the question would be

1514
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,040
how does one organize 250 000 people how

1515
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,040
efficient was that

1516
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,240
was that a success to which extent could

1517
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,759
you make effective use of it

1518
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,400
that is a great question roman

1519
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,200
yes

1520
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,440
probably let me

1521
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,920
have a comment on this because we were

1522
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,760
researching this situation yes this

1523
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,920
situation is very interesting

1524
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,720
in terms of a huge amount of volunteers

1525
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
from around the world

1526
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,799
connected to this

1527
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,359
call i would say

1528
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,480
it actually helped us to feel more

1529
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,920
um

1530
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,760
not alone in this fight uh but

1531
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,880
of course uh i think this huge amount of

1532
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,000
people

1533
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,480
acting uh

1534
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,920
irregularly i would say because

1535
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,520
there was no

1536
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,119
actually no

1537
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,960
single point of

1538
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,240
coordination in this situation

1539
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,839
yes it created as we can

1540
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,640
observe it created a huge force

1541
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,760
uh

1542
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,400
directed towards russians i mean in

1543
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
terms of ddos attacks first of all

1544
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,079
because

1545
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,200
that amount of volunteers created uh

1546
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,079
first of all a huge wave of ddos attack

1547
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,839
against russian

1548
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,760
but

1549
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,960
as well as anonymous group there were

1550
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,599
different groups that were

1551
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,359
acting more precisely more sophisticated

1552
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,040
and probably if uh for people uh there

1553
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,119
were different

1554
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,720
situations when some did those actions

1555
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,680
were preventing

1556
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,160
some more technically sophisticated

1557
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,520
separations

1558
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,559
yes

1559
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,920
it is

1560
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,240
i think the problem that cannot be

1561
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,079
solved

1562
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,839
just by creating telegram channels

1563
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:47,440
but i think this should be some

1564
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,640
more

1565
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,880
organized coordination

1566
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,720
between this kind of amount of people

1567
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,599
but

1568
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,240
yes this situation is very interesting

1569
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,200
and

1570
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,440
this subject to be researched in the

1571
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,119
future because

1572
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,040
there was no such an experience involved

1573
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,119
before

1574
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,559
so one site is the distributed denial of

1575
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,240
secrets website that uh

1576
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,640
over six million documents as of a few

1577
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,960
weeks ago uh had been

1578
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,839
taken from russia official documents and

1579
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,839
posted on this site and it will

1580
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,880
literally take years for researchers to

1581
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,280
absorb them and to parse them

1582
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,920
but it has been probably the result of a

1583
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,559
worldwide collection of hackers uh

1584
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,640
anonymously volunteering

1585
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,599
so

1586
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,440
let's see the next hand just here in the

1587
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,680
middle

1588
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,880
indeed you right there

1589
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,200
hello uh dennis sucker jeff's cloudflare

1590
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,480
so um

1591
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,680
while the whole world is obviously

1592
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,760
applauding the bravery and courage of

1593
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,520
ukraine both on a battlefield you know

1594
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,240
and in a cyber space and how you quickly

1595
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,160
ramped up your resilience

1596
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,359
the question because we're talking about

1597
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,960
the cyber war we established that it's a

1598
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,880
global cyber war and it might sound a

1599
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,799
bit provocative but you know in a normal

1600
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,200
war we typically would be thinking about

1601
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,400
also counter-attacking you know

1602
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,680
suppressing the enemy to actually

1603
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,920
diminish their capability to actually

1604
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,960
attack

1605
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,880
so in my question would be around what

1606
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,119
is your take what is your opinion on you

1607
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,480
know actually diminishing russia's

1608
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,160
ability to attack the free world to

1609
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,480
attack the democracies because obviously

1610
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,400
you know even if they stop the attacks

1611
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,319
on the ground their capability of

1612
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,160
actually attacking you know in the cyber

1613
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,039
space

1614
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,039
are pretty much unlimited so what is

1615
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,960
your take on actually putting it down or

1616
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,799
like at least limiting their resources

1617
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:35,760
and how

1618
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,359
we can help that or how we can look at

1619
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,480
that as a strategy as well

1620
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,720
well thank you

1621
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,880
i suppose the most effective way of

1622
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,640
preventing russia for escalation in

1623
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,400
cyber voice

1624
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,640
the instrument of sanctions

1625
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,599
and

1626
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,520
both

1627
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,240
technological and financial

1628
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,520
since

1629
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,079
every operation requires preparation for

1630
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,079
it and

1631
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,079
it requires human resources it requires

1632
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,240
technologies infrastructure

1633
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,079
and sometimes

1634
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,640
great budgets are spent in preparation

1635
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,839
of these cyber attacks in

1636
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:18,319
case russia isn't able to to finance

1637
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,559
these uh operations

1638
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,559
uh of course the danger the threat

1639
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,880
from russian military hackers

1640
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,520
will will decrease

1641
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,480
again

1642
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,000
we we observe a number of uh

1643
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,440
cases when

1644
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,839
a great number of cases when a western

1645
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,720
technology company

1646
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,160
had cut off their business in russia and

1647
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,599
that means that a lot of licenses of

1648
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,400
software technologies hardware is no

1649
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,359
longer available for russia and

1650
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,160
especially in case of

1651
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,000
having ability to to use infrastructures

1652
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,880
abroad well i are confident that uh

1653
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,440
there's much more intention from

1654
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,599
cyber intelligence to to

1655
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,440
cases of use of

1656
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,680
such infrastructure for attacking

1657
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,920
ukraine and other countries

1658
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,640
and

1659
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,119
in case these technological sanctions

1660
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,119
continue we believe that it would be

1661
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,119
much more difficult to organize these

1662
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,960
attacks from

1663
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,559
side of russian federation since you

1664
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,440
cannot

1665
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,520
you can create the infrastructure for

1666
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,240
attacking out from nothing

1667
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,440
uh

1668
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,079
the next point is that uh we observe a

1669
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,760
constant intellectual flow out from

1670
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,520
russia shows

1671
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,640
so

1672
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,839
for some extent we can expect that

1673
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,039
the attacking potential

1674
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,960
is approaching its limit

1675
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,520
the number of

1676
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,119
skilled people

1677
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,039
who are used in organizing providing

1678
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,680
these attacks is is limited to

1679
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,480
to

1680
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,160
number of uh

1681
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,480
military servants and number of

1682
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,160
cyber criminals

1683
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,680
that joined

1684
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,400
these

1685
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,440
groups

1686
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,079
uh that target uh ukrainian critical

1687
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,000
structure and uh

1688
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,720
infrastructures in other countries

1689
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,480
and uh in case uh

1690
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,000
this this potential cannot

1691
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,720
be

1692
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,400
increased by russia i i suppose the the

1693
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,920
impact the global impact of the

1694
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,799
operation would decrease uh

1695
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,160
so um

1696
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,039
yeah again sanctions uh should uh should

1697
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,079
continue in order to stop uh the

1698
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,559
escalation of this cyber aggression and

1699
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,599
i believe

1700
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,000
our joint efforts uh uh will be

1701
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,480
effective

1702
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,960
can it may i

1703
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,920
may i continue a little bit on that sure

1704
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,680
i think that one of the reason that we

1705
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,599
have not really seen any cyber

1706
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,480
operations in finland is probably

1707
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,599
because

1708
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,079
the resources are busy failing in

1709
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,079
ukraine and there will not be any more

1710
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,319
skilled resources

1711
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,559
coming or adding to it so that might be

1712
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,480
one of the reason why we are not seeing

1713
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,240
what we have been expecting

1714
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,319
there's a question here in the middle

1715
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,640
yes

1716
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,319
hi johanna weaver from the tech policy

1717
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,079
design center at the australian national

1718
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,280
university

1719
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,039
and i want to echo the comments of the

1720
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,440
previous question about the bravery and

1721
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,839
the courage of the ukrainians i also

1722
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,000
wanted to particularly acknowledge

1723
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,079
natalia and victor's

1724
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,559
weight that you personally carry on your

1725
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,680
shoulders

1726
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
with respect to

1727
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,599
the cyber defenses

1728
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,799
and my question is related to that in

1729
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,640
the sense that we've heard quite a lot

1730
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,119
about the role of the private sector in

1731
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,359
assisting ukrainians

1732
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,839
and we've

1733
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,960
we've uh i have heard it described that

1734
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,559
particularly at the beginning of this

1735
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,799
conflict uh the

1736
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,960
private sector was sort of tripping over

1737
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,799
itself in terms of

1738
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,160
trying to offer assistance and so my

1739
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,440
question to you is twofold one is there

1740
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,960
is that still happening and is there

1741
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,599
anything that we in this room can do to

1742
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,520
help the burden that the two of you are

1743
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,720
carrying

1744
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,680
and then two-fold is is there anything

1745
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,079
we can learn from this experience

1746
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,599
so that if we

1747
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,680
are in this situation again that we can

1748
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,119
have a situ a coordination in place in

1749
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,119
advance

1750
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,559
well thank you um

1751
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,640
yes this is a unique example how the

1752
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,240
private sector can

1753
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,039
contribute to the global task of

1754
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,240
defending our country in cyberspace and

1755
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,480
this was initiated before the war with

1756
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,880
the first strikes

1757
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,960
which are described earlier i mean the

1758
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,839
in the middle of uh january we gathered

1759
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,240
uh with the

1760
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,799
group of uh ukrainian experts

1761
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,119
and uh we started a discussion

1762
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,880
what should we change in order to

1763
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,960
prevent uh

1764
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,560
the uh following um attacks uh against

1765
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,799
ukraine so it was obvious that the voice

1766
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,120
prepared and cyber attacks will proceed

1767
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,279
and will support uh

1768
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,439
military protection we didn't know

1769
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,040
uh we don't know what when it should

1770
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,319
happen but uh uh we were confident that

1771
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,198
uh

1772
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,920
the wall will start in the near future

1773
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,120
and uh

1774
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,600
first our first meetings regarding how

1775
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,279
to protect energy sector for example

1776
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,560
started in the

1777
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,920
end of uh

1778
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,319
december

1779
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,040
so

1780
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,120
we uh we came to a conclusion that we

1781
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,560
should

1782
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,719
first of all

1783
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,158
raise the

1784
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,960
awareness right the responsibility of

1785
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,520
cisos and critical infrastructures

1786
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,920
we should make changes to our

1787
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,279
legislation

1788
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,679
to allow experts participate in bug

1789
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,839
bounties in

1790
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,719
a responsible disclosure of

1791
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,120
vulnerabilities that can be found in our

1792
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,880
government government entities and

1793
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
critical infrastructure

1794
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,600
we should uh we should concentrate on uh

1795
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,158
um raising uh salaries for for

1796
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,000
responsible people of course in order to

1797
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,839
hire professionals so

1798
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,279
for these positions

1799
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,479
um

1800
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,960
and uh this is we should probably

1801
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,359
organize some mobile teams

1802
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,359
and

1803
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,640
enhance the coordination between

1804
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,000
cyber security agencies so that that was

1805
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,759
a set of initiatives

1806
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,198
and some of them even partially

1807
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:53,040
uh have been implemented during the war

1808
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,120
but

1809
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,159
the first

1810
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,040
approach was to to talk to our expert

1811
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,239
community

1812
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,320
and when they was started we were

1813
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,600
offered a

1814
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,920
huge number of different proposals so um

1815
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,679
stepping back to the huge number of

1816
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,199
uh

1817
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,760
volunteers that joined the ukraine iit

1818
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,560
army and the rest who

1819
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,960
work on separate tasks

1820
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,239
is of course their will to help country

1821
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,840
with their skills with their knowledge

1822
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,120
and experience

1823
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,480
and this is priceless of course

1824
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,960
their activity which roman just

1825
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,320
mentioned

1826
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,239
is self-coordinated so it's volunteer

1827
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,159
activity and while

1828
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,320
uh ukrainian official agencies

1829
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,239
still concentrate on cyber defense cyber

1830
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,480
protection of our critical

1831
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,080
infrastructure and

1832
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,320
government websites and we are

1833
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,880
helping business at the same time so

1834
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,360
we understand that a lot of businesses

1835
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,520
were forced to move out of their

1836
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,080
locations

1837
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,159
they need to

1838
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,640
move their i.t infrastructures to clouds

1839
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,960
or to data centers in the western part

1840
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,600
of ukraine or even abroad

1841
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,800
and that requires a lot of um a lot of

1842
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,920
help which was provided from uh the

1843
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,400
government from triple sap which i

1844
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,159
present here and uh

1845
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,040
other

1846
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,679
entities and uh this is this is a kind

1847
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,719
of uh

1848
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,400
bilateral movement so

1849
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,239
we uh

1850
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,640
offered an assistant from private sector

1851
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,320
and at the same time

1852
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,880
the government offered a system to those

1853
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,920
businesses who suffered uh

1854
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,520
from the consequences of war and

1855
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,560
needed a needed assistance in there

1856
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,880
and continue their their businesses in

1857
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,440
new i.t infrastructures

1858
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,920
some of experts joined

1859
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,199
our service or joint armed forces

1860
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,520
in order to to help or

1861
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
being a military servants in order to

1862
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,760
help

1863
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,480
building the

1864
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,880
cyber security systems and

1865
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,480
in enhancing

1866
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,960
improving of

1867
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,040
technologies used and mechanics that

1868
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,520
help protect

1869
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,120
our country in these challenging times

1870
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,960
again

1871
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,520
what is what is extremely available for

1872
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,480
us with the help of global i.t community

1873
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,000
global i.t players that offered us

1874
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,040
cloud infrastructures licenses

1875
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,960
threat intelligence

1876
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,719
hardware

1877
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,960
a lot of a lot of

1878
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,159
other assistant that that is

1879
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,719
very important and very valuable for for

1880
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,520
our cyber resilience and

1881
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,080
again this this help is hard to over

1882
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,239
estimate so this is this is

1883
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,440
are all examples of uh public private

1884
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,000
partnership and i believe that uh after

1885
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,880
all victory uh will concentrate on

1886
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,600
keeping of this

1887
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
uh synergy uh

1888
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,880
of helping each other and uh no doubt

1889
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,480
this so will bring us to a completely

1890
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,840
new new

1891
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,280
results and level of cooperation

1892
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,880
back there

1893
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,120
yes

1894
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,520
thank you my name is lisa pasta and i'm

1895
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,000
the chief information security officer

1896
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,199
for homeland security in estonia

1897
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,040
and my question comes from the premise

1898
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,040
that often when people say they're not

1899
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,440
seeing cyber attacks it's not because

1900
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,120
there's a lack of cyber attacks but

1901
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,520
because they're flying blind

1902
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,679
so given what i understand to be a

1903
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,280
rather

1904
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,960
on-prem

1905
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
and diverse

1906
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,719
information system ecosystem in ukraine

1907
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,760
prior to february 24th

1908
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,080
how would you assess

1909
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,800
our visibility into the ukrainian

1910
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,239
systems and then also around the cyber

1911
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,400
attacks or cyber operations

1912
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,800
around the war in ukraine

1913
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
earlier this year how well were we

1914
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,800
seeing

1915
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:17,760
um

1916
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,760
i propose we probably

1917
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,199
will have three short answers

1918
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:28,239
uh but uh the lessons from not betray uh

1919
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,960
we're particularly of uh improving

1920
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,199
cooperation improving visibility

1921
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,480
improving uh information exchange

1922
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,640
and uh the project of building a

1923
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,440
security operations center in triple sap

1924
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,520
which was led by roman

1925
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,600
and the creation of a

1926
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,320
national cyber security coordination

1927
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,440
center

1928
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,480
which is managed by italia

1929
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,120
and many many other capacities for

1930
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,040
providing 24 hours monitoring of

1931
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,520
our cyberspace

1932
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,360
in order to

1933
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,080
proactively

1934
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,440
work on mitigating cyber threats

1935
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,920
that was one of major

1936
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,159
approaches together with raising of

1937
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,159
awareness cyber hygiene and a lot of

1938
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,159
many things

1939
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,280
and

1940
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,440
we understand that cyber security is of

1941
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,320
course people process technology but uh

1942
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,880
the main focus should be put into

1943
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,440
coordination and information exchange

1944
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,520
not only between a ukrainian cyber

1945
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,280
security agencies but with our

1946
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,040
international partners as well

1947
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,920
and uh this is this is the effect that

1948
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,920
was significantly improved for the

1949
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,360
beginning of war

1950
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,960
uh that this allows us uh to to get uh

1951
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,320
prompt uh

1952
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,800
information on potential threats and

1953
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,600
indicators of compromise 24 hours

1954
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,000
and uh

1955
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,320
we we get this from

1956
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,640
all around the globe and uh this is

1957
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,239
really 24 hours and uh this allows us to

1958
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,640
react promptly uh just like as it

1959
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,719
happened in uh ukrainian regional power

1960
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,320
distribution company

1961
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,480
with the industrial to which was

1962
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,239
promptly identified and mitigated that's

1963
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,120
that's a very good example of this uh

1964
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,440
international cooperation and use of

1965
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,040
threat intel

1966
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:21,840
for

1967
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,040
for timely

1968
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,960
response to to these threats

1969
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,400
lisa you said how much do we see and the

1970
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,520
problem is that there are a lot of

1971
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,440
different ways that that could apply to

1972
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,719
and they all have very different

1973
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,360
motivations for how much they want to

1974
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,480
see

1975
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,239
now a lot of the commercial entities

1976
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,360
involved in it will of course have a

1977
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,719
very clear picture of what's going on

1978
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:43,920
but then at the other end of the

1979
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,040
spectrum

1980
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,679
you have the political climate that i

1981
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,400
referred to every else earlier where it

1982
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,719
would be preferable not to see in some

1983
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,640
cases what is happening

1984
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,480
and i'm referring for example to the

1985
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,080
spillover of the viasat hack again

1986
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,920
effects across europe some of them quite

1987
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,480
substantial i heard in a um a

1988
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,400
conversation in one of the the

1989
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,400
pre-events this week that the suggestion

1990
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,120
that the reason why that was not treated

1991
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
as uh harm caused by russia and

1992
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,960
something which should be taken up away

1993
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,360
russia was because it was cyber and

1994
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,520
therefore it was something special which

1995
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,960
is not the business of nato nobody

1996
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,800
should be talking about article 5 nobody

1997
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,520
should be thinking about countermeasures

1998
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,520
the problem is looking at it in the

1999
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,440
longer term it fits into a very

2000
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,199
different pattern

2001
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,679
of the willingness of european countries

2002
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,280
to play down attacks by russia

2003
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,040
over a period of years which in many

2004
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,880
cases have been indistinguishable from

2005
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,560
acts of war

2006
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,560
but the problem is that if you recognize

2007
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,159
them as such

2008
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,960
whether it is russian military officers

2009
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,320
traveling to the czech republic in

2010
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,400
bulgaria to to blow up munitions dumps

2011
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,320
in classic behind the line sabotage

2012
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,239
where it's the ongoing classic

2013
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,320
electronic warfare cross border into

2014
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,920
norway for example all of these things

2015
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,080
including special operations against

2016
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,679
nato members

2017
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,159
have not been elevated to the level of a

2018
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,840
conversation about whether this is

2019
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,560
actually a real attack by russia because

2020
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,600
if you do that suddenly politicians are

2021
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,000
presented with the challenge of actually

2022
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,560
having to do something about it

2023
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,320
and so it doesn't reach that threshold

2024
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,040
and this again is tapping into the uh

2025
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,440
the problem that i i referred to earlier

2026
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,040
which is the

2027
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,199
overriding impression that has permeated

2028
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,360
so many of our political debates that

2029
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,000
any attempt to impede russia in what it

2030
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,640
wants to do to its neighbors

2031
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,880
is inevitably going to lead to

2032
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,640
uncontrollable escalation up to the

2033
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,800
level of global conflict including

2034
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,880
exchanges of nuclear weapons we hear

2035
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,840
this repeated again and again

2036
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,400
by senior western politicians again

2037
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,840
repeating the narratives that we hear

2038
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,600
from president putin and every other

2039
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,840
level of the russian information warfare

2040
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,760
apparatus

2041
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,840
the challenge then is a willful

2042
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,239
disregard of what has been going on for

2043
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,199
so long and where ukraine as in so many

2044
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,320
other ways is doing us the favor is in

2045
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,719
winning that argument that we no longer

2046
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,600
need to argue uphill about the fact that

2047
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,960
russia is

2048
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,679
a challenge russia is a hostile state

2049
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,679
russia is invading its neighbours

2050
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,000
causing damage across the rest of europe

2051
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,880
that basic fact now has been established

2052
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,320
so what i'm hoping

2053
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,080
is that everything else that follows on

2054
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,640
from that in terms of western responses

2055
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,760
should now be a little bit easier

2056
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,000
and if i may continue that that why not

2057
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,360
acknowledge

2058
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,199
every every attack that we see for

2059
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,640
example if we look at airspace

2060
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,640
violations in finland we have this

2061
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,679
policy that each and every time russia

2062
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,000
violates our airspace we publish it in

2063
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,040
the newspapers for everyone to see

2064
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,880
but the problem of doing the same in

2065
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,520
cyberspace is of course that what about

2066
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,120
those things that you really haven't

2067
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,679
seen and then you kind of give out your

2068
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:02,560
capacity or lack of capacity to actually

2069
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,719
detect everything that is going on so

2070
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,520
maybe better also to play them down

2071
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,800
yeah yeah i i would like to add i think

2072
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,880
that if we are talking about enhancing

2073
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,440
international cooperation in cyber

2074
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,199
so the first thing that we need to do

2075
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,199
it's common attribution

2076
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,400
really that all the countries you really

2077
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,600
should say it is russia and we know this

2078
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,480
because when it was black energy cyber

2079
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,639
talks

2080
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,760
and we attributed it to russia you know

2081
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,400
we had so many questions like but why do

2082
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,400
you think it's russia what evidences do

2083
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,760
you have and many countries officially

2084
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,880
doubted our conclusions and we're very

2085
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,040
thankful to our partners the united

2086
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,840
states great britain netherlands who

2087
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,440
supported us

2088
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,960
and we we had made a common statement

2089
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,440
and but now i think it's obvious that

2090
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,520
russia is this malicious player in

2091
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,280
cyberspace

2092
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,560
so

2093
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,320
absolutely true when the masks are off

2094
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,800
we of course understand to stand behind

2095
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,040
the majority of cyber attacks

2096
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,440
but uh before the war we were very

2097
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,760
accurate in attributing we all know that

2098
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,880
uh

2099
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,679
it's difficult to deal with and uh

2100
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,600
we need to convince everybody we have

2101
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,719
hundred percent proven evidences that uh

2102
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:25,950
that can

2103
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,440
[Music]

2104
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,199
allow us come to a conclusion for

2105
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,639
particular attribution of every

2106
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,679
attack

2107
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:34,960
but uh

2108
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,600
we were often asked so what about why

2109
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,679
assad for example did you investigate

2110
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,000
the this case and this is a grand

2111
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,840
example of uh

2112
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,080
international cooperation uh with

2113
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,679
regards to attribution since of course

2114
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,320
uh on the 24th of february

2115
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,960
certainly and other cyber security

2116
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,159
agencies

2117
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,040
were busy with the other issues of

2118
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,400
unfortunately

2119
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,360
and uh with a lack of

2120
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,520
of visibility regarding this particular

2121
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,679
case but

2122
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,080
we were provided with the

2123
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,040
materials that

2124
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,040
obviously prove uh

2125
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,040
who stood behind this attack and that

2126
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,120
was done by

2127
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,639
by our partners

2128
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,840
and this allowed these statements of 27

2129
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,600
countries

2130
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,639
who recognized russia an aggressor

2131
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,199
in cyberspace and this is

2132
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,280
this is the key factor which allows us

2133
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,800
in the future

2134
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,480
um

2135
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,080
address to these status

2136
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,280
having

2137
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,920
having enough evidences

2138
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,400
for other cyber security incidents and

2139
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,840
what is more important

2140
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,560
and we've been doing this for the whole

2141
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,239
period of war

2142
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,719
not recording only evidences of war

2143
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,120
crimes of russia but of

2144
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,600
cyber security crimes as well so we

2145
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,080
collect these evidences and we will then

2146
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,880
give it to the icc

2147
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,920
in order to to be punished

2148
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,560
so this is this is a hybrid war

2149
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,920
and

2150
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,920
the responsibility should be

2151
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,480
both for war crimes and for cyber crimes

2152
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,799
as well

2153
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,920
let's cheer

2154
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,440
from ccdc

2155
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,199
as you mentioned uh

2156
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,560
some of the speakers already mentioned

2157
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,000
but the

2158
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,760
behavior of

2159
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,000
actors who affiliated with russia

2160
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,520
changed

2161
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,480
since

2162
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,159
end of february

2163
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,760
the operations were focused more on

2164
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,080
ukraine while other nations were left

2165
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,600
less at least very not in the focus of

2166
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,639
attention

2167
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,360
uh i would like to ask if you observed

2168
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,120
also change

2169
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,760
in behavior of other actors

2170
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,679
who probably didn't stop their malicious

2171
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,320
activities both in ukraine or

2172
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,239
around the world

2173
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,559
thank you

2174
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,120
i

2175
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,080
you know uh maybe at present really the

2176
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,120
uh

2177
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,880
all the attention of the russian

2178
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,360
federation is on ukraine

2179
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,679
but we predict

2180
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,080
that in near's future and actually it's

2181
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,000
already going on the western countries

2182
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,199
will be the main object for tax

2183
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,239
and

2184
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,480
we can see the new vectors of such

2185
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,120
attacks first of all it is industrial

2186
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,280
espionage

2187
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,920
because of sanctions uh russia lost

2188
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,120
access to new technologies

2189
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,320
and this country will try all illegal

2190
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,719
instruments to get this

2191
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,719
so really western current countries need

2192
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,440
to be prepared to this

2193
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,600
and the second thing

2194
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,520
uh we're witnessing that russia actually

2195
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,679
legalizing i would call it cyber piracy

2196
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,600
you know like it was in medieval ages

2197
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,120
when a sauron

2198
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,719
gave permission to a pirate to rob ships

2199
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,760
of other countries and this pirate

2200
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,239
was sharing this illegal income to the

2201
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:23,920
sovereign

2202
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,440
so

2203
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,600
taking into consideration that all the

2204
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,840
russian hacker groups are being under

2205
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,960
control

2206
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,679
of russian special services

2207
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,639
and russia has a substantial

2208
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,960
problems with this budget

2209
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,040
because of sanctions

2210
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,960
so russian hackers

2211
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,400
will simply be officially allowed to rob

2212
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,639
western banks

2213

2214
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,760

united states naval academy and my

2222
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,760
question is how do you view the actions

2223
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
of independent non-state affiliate

2224
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,400
estate-affiliated

2225
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,159
hacktivists such as the belarusian

2226
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,400
railway hackers since they don't operate

2227
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,760
with any oversight from the ukrainian

2228
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,199
government but still support your cause

thanks

2230
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,960
so actually

2231
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,679
yes uh when we restarting the

2232
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,600
actions of uh

2233
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,239
that uh huge amounts of people involved

2234
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:42,960
in

2235
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,560
the situation

2236
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,800
uh yeah there was uh

2237
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,440
uh not just a question of uh

2238
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,400
understanding of coordination or

2239
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,960
any kind of

2240
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,080
purpose or target

2241
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,360
setting but also there was an ethical

2242
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,840
question on

2243
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,960
what are these actions can lead to

2244
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,080
basically

2245
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,600
uh

2246
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,280
a lot of

2247
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,360
international volunteers were aiming not

2248
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,000
just only

2249
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,560
governmental uh

2250
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,040
resources for military resources but

2251
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,239
other resources which were also uh

2252
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,440
affecting

2253
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,159
the

2254
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,280
other people

2255
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,199
uh in a country

2256
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,960
and uh of course

2257
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,600
what less lessons we can

2258
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,560
learn from this situation uh is first of

2259
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,199
all uh there is a huge support on a

2260
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,880
volunteer basis

2261
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,440
not just in our country but also around

2262
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,719
the world

2263
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,040
and the second uh

2264
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,639
is that for such kind of situation

2265
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,320
uh

2266
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,040
in our country for example uh or

2267
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,239
probably in any other institutions there

2268
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,159
was no completely

2269
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,760
preparedness for

2270
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,520
any kind of

2271
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,719
informational distribution or

2272
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,639
communication

2273
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,719
while

2274
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,679
in this situation it would be very very

2275
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,040
uh on demand

2276
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,199

2277
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,719
so i think we'll call an end to the

2278
