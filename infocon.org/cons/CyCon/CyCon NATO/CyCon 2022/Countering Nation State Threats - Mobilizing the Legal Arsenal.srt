1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,040
name is lucas kello

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
i'm an associate professor of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
international relations at oxford

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,719
university where i also serve as a

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,880
co-director of the university's

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,920
center for doctoral training in cyber

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,560
security

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
in this panel we will discuss

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,800
the mobilization of the legal system to

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
counter nation state cyber threats

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,000
this is an enduring

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
and in some regards i think intractable

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
challenge owing to major obstacles in

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
the legal system one concerns

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
international law

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
nations disagree sometimes fundamentally

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,360
about how laws and norms of restraint

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,520
apply in this domain which has produced

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
a situation where in western governments

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
and democratic governments broadly

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
speaking restrain their offensive

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
activities far more than autocratic

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
regimes and their proxies

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,960
do

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
another major challenge involves

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,039
jurisdictional fragmentation

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
nations that seek to apply their

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
domestic

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
penal codes to punish perpetrators

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
routinely struggle to do so because they

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
reside within foreign soil and often

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
have an association with their parent

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,880
government or enjoy its protection and

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
this is certainly true

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
of course of foreign state actors so

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
this afternoon we have assembled a

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
fantastic group of speakers representing

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,920
three distinct perspectives on and

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
efforts to address these obstacles and

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
the purpose of the discussion is not

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
merely to identify limitations

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
in the existing legal system but also to

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
showcase innovative efforts to

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
overcome them

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
so we have with us

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880

folks who put this together

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
this is a crucially important time

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
for us to gather

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
as our nato as nato allies and other

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
partners

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
i know that the crisis in ukraine is

102
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
front of mind for all of us um in

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
particular the inspiring

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
bravery and the resilience of the

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
ukrainian people um who are fighting to

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
defend their families and their homes

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
and their democracy and i know that's

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
something that we're all thinking about

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,799
and it's also a profound reminder of the

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
values that we all share in this room

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
um and our commitments and our shared

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
responsibility as we discuss uh the

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
important policy and legal topics that

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
have been front and center during this

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
conference so

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,798
let me begin uh by

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
talking just a little bit about what i

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,238
do at the department of justice i'll

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
talk briefly about that then i'll turn

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
to touch on the nature of the cyber

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
threat landscape as we see it in the

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
united states and then i'll talk briefly

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
about some of the things that we're

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
doing within the federal government

125
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
within the united states to address the

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
cyber threats that we're facing

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
so as many of you know

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,160
the department of justice where i work

129
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
is the lead uh federal agency for

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
enforcing the laws of the united states

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
there are different parts to the

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
department of justice there's maine

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
justice and then there's a number of

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
field offices or u.s attorney's offices

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
i lead a division of the department of

136
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
justice the national security division

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
as you said lucas we focus on

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
counterterrorism counter-espionage

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
cyber threats from nation states and

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
other threats to our national security

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,520
we also play a key role in bridging the

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
law enforcement agencies within the

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
united states and the intelligence

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,199
community so that's

145
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
we often work with classified

146
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
information we figure out how we can use

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
classified information for example in

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
criminal prosecutions

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
and you know as many of you know as all

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,479
of you know actually the what we are

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,800
seeing in terms of cyber threats are now

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
among our greatest national security

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,039
threats um and our job in the now

154
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
security division is to go after

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,199
nation state actors who carry out

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
malicious cyber activity inside the

157
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,360
united states and this is an area of

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
increasing complexity

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
let me talk just a little bit about the

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,759
nature of

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
the cyber threat landscape that we see

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,639
you know there's just a number of ways

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,120
in which nation states in particular and

164
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
when we talk about the our adversaries

165
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,720
we really are talking about four

166
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
significant adversaries russia china

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
north korea and iran um and in various

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
ways these these nation states act to

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
steal our technology

170
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,160
they carry out economic espionage to

171
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
steal trade secrets from

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,720
technology companies for example they

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
amass personal information about u.s

174
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
citizens to build databases

175
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,759
about

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,120
our citizens

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
they seek to

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
influence either

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
covertly or even overtly in a malign way

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
are democratic processes

181
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
and then through

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
various cyber means they seek to hold

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
our critical infrastructure at risk to

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
either disruptive or even destructive

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
attacks

186
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
let me just give you a few examples

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
of what i'm talking about and again

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
these are going to be examples that are

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
going to be quite familiar to to folks

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,639
in this room

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
for one last year we had the government

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
of china engaging in a malicious cyber

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
campaign that exploited vulnerabilities

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
in the microsoft exchange servers

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
in order to compromise victims it was a

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,160
massive operation resulted in

197
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
significant costs

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
for primarily private sector

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
victims

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
iranian government actors have

201
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
interfered with with uh critical

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,639
infrastructure systems on a broad range

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,639
of victims within the united states and

204
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
in north korea uh

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
north korean government actors have

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
robbed cryptocurrency exchanges and

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
central banks stealing hundreds of

208
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
millions of dollars uh that

209
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
are used in some ways to evade sanctions

210
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
and to support their weapons programs

211
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
um so look at doj like uh across the

212
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
federal government across uh are out

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
with our allies as well we are

214
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
particularly focused on russia uh for

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,560
very good reason

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
um you take for example the recent cyber

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,319
attack that russia carried out again in

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
europe against satellite internet

219
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,360
infrastructure uh viasat the viasat

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
attack um as russian troops were

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
preparing to move into ukraine in the

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
early morning hours of february 24th

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
satellite internet connections

224
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
were suddenly disrupted in ukraine

225
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
this attack by russia against the

226
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
satellite ground systems the

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
infrastructure plunged tens of thousands

228
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
of people in in europe across europe

229
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,879
into internet darkness uh it hit part of

230
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,919
the ukrainian defenses a month later

231
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,440
into march thousands of people in europe

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
were still

233
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
reportedly offline and that included

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
2000 wind turbines in germany so this is

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
just one of the latest examples of how

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
russia has used

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
its cyber capabilities to support its

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
invasion of ukraine

239
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
russia's solar winds attack

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
last year

241
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
carried out by their intelligence

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,959
service by the svr

243
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,800
attacked and compromised tens of

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
thousands of networks globally

245
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
including in the united states we're

246
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,560
very very concerned about the attack and

247
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
the effect on u.s government systems

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
part of a massive spying campaign so

249
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
then you go back to the most costly uh

250
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
cyber attack in history the 2017 not

251
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
petchey attack

252
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,360
carried out by the russian military

253
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
intelligence the greu

254
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,399
that in in fact was a destructive attack

255
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
so this is a pattern by the russian

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
government and we are

257
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
bracing in the united states for more

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,880
attacks the white house recently

259
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
reiterated the warning

260
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
that there could be potentially russian

261
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
actors who would carry out malicious

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
cyber activity

263
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
including as a response to the

264
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
unprecedented economic costs

265
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
we've imposed on russia alongside our

266
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
allies and partners

267
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
so

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
um

269
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
what are we doing about this what are we

270
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
doing about this cyber

271
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
threat landscaping particularly

272
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
when it comes to russia and i think you

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
know our our general strategy is to use

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
all of the legal tools in our in our

275
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
arsenal

276
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
one of our core authorities of course is

277
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
the enforcement of our criminal laws

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,040
through

279
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
investigation and prosecution

280
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,800
um we believe it's

281
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,680
essential that we hold criminal actors

282
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
accountable um and it's also one way

283
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
that we can publicly inform

284
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
uh

285
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
private companies and the general public

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
about the nature of the threats we face

287
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,839
so this past march the department of

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
justice and my division announced

289
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
charges that we had returned against

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
four

291
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
russian nationals associated with the

292
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
russian government

293
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
for their involvement in two campaigns

294
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
that targeted critical infrastructure

295
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,560
not just in the united states but

296
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
globally

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,920
in the energy sector between 2012 and

298
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
2018.

299
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
one of those cases charged a russian

300
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
national who was a member of a russian

301
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,760
military research institute with a

302
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
multi-year effort to hack into

303
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
industrial consult control systems

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
companies overseas and in the united

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,399
states

306
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,240
and the goal is to physically damage the

307
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
safety functions of these systems

308
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
in another case we charged

309
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,279
three russian intelligence officers with

310
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
targeting software and hardware control

311
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
systems of companies in the energy

312
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,760
sector

313
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
to gain

314
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
surface and persistent access to those

315
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
systems so this is the kind of activity

316
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
that really vividly demonstrates

317
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
both the capability and the intent of

318
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
russian government actors they have

319
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
global reach and ambition

320
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,399
and that's one benefit of these

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,000
indictments these public charges but

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
it's not the only one because

323
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
uh in these cases we haven't arrested

324
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
anyone to date but that doesn't mean we

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
won't we have long memories um and we

326
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
are patient

327
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
and that includes not just the

328
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
department of justice but our primary

329
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
investigative agency the fbi

330
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,320
so beyond what we do when it comes to

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
criminal charges we also are looking to

332
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
be proactive

333
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
we know that prosecutions are not the

334
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
only thing that we can do at the

335
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
department of justice and in fact we are

336
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,000
looking for ways to actually prevent

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
these attacks before they occur

338
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and so even when an arrest may be

339
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,279
unlikely um we prior way prioritize the

340
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,800
disruption of criminal cyber activity so

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
recently we have taken a more proactive

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
approach um and let me give you a couple

343
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,519
examples this this goes back

344
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,680
um uh some time

345
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
to the microsoft exchange server attack

346
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
of last year where um

347
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
as i mentioned we had zero day

348
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
vulnerabilities uh by a chinese

349
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
government hacking group that was

350
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
sponsored by the ministry

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
of state security

352
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
and through these vulnerabilities that

353
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
the group the hafnium actors were able

354
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,480
to place web shells on mail servers

355
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,120
allowed for access to the content of

356
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,200
email as well as the ability to place

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
additional malicious files effectively

358
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
giving chinese intelligence the ability

359
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
to spy on a wide range of victims

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
universities law firms think tanks

361
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
non-government organizations

362
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
so private sector mitigation had some

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,519
benefit but

364
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,639
nearly a month after these

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
vulnerabilities were discovered there

366
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
were still hundreds of these web shells

367
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
still on on u.s servers

368
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,639
so running this software so

369
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
with court approval in april of 2021 of

370
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,959
last year

371
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,440
we were able to conduct an operation

372
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
that actually removed

373
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
the remaining half

374
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
hafnium's

375
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,839
web shells

376
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
these could have been used to maintain

377
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
access and and this was an again an

378
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,079
authorized court order that gave us the

379
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,120
ability to do this um a similar a

380
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
similar uh

381
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
uh a similar uh

382
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
uh activity that we undertook um just a

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,040
few weeks ago involved malware known as

384
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
cyclops blink and this is something that

385
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
an attack that the russian intel

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
military intelligence service the gru

387
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
had carried out

388
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
we had identified this malware that was

389
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,839
connected to the

390
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,000
gru um and it had established a series

391
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
of botnets um

392
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
and we were able to again use our court

393
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
authorized search and seizure authority

394
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,880
to remove the ability of the command and

395
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
control layer to uh to manage this

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
botnet again sort of a traditional

397
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,680
search and seizure authority that you

398
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
can use in a regular criminal case and

399
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
we were able to use it to as a as an

400
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,199
authority to remove the

401
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
instrumentalities of that crime that is

402
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
the malicious code

403
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,279
so that eliminated the ability of this

404
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
command and control layer to control the

405
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
botnet it's just a good example of how

406
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
we're looking to leverage

407
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
the legal tools that we have in new ways

408
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
so these are traditional legal tools

409
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,639
that we are leveraging in new ways in

410
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
the cyber context to have real impact in

411
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
an operational way

412
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
so

413
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,959
we have additional tools

414
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
that we also can rely on in this all

415
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,040
tools approach we look to forfeiture

416
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
we also through the fbi work with our

417
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,480
partners to

418
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
provide targeted intelligence to the

419
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
private sector to give them the

420
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,600
information they need sometimes we

421
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,880
declassify classified information

422
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
and we recognize that you know this is

423
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,399
not the only set of tools that we have

424
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,680
that law enforcement is a part of a

425
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,720
broader government-wide effort um so we

426
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
look to see us as a force multiplier to

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
use our unique authorities along with

428
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,399
treasury department and and state

429
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
department um and defense department all

430
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,320
of our partners in the federal

431
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
government who have their own

432
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
authorities that we can use

433
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,959
um

434
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,360
so look i i think that's probably enough

435
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
for now in terms of the the way in which

436
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,279
the department of justice is

437
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,000
providing support and coordination with

438
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
our partners in in the federal

439
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,120
government as long as as well as with

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,079
our partners uh in other countries and

441
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
our allies

442
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,199
this really kind of just scratches the

443
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,480
surface and i know we'll have some

444
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
questions

445
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
to to respond to so again thank you very

446
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
much for the opportunity to participate

447
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,519
in this hearing and i look forward to

448
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,600
hearing to our other panelists so thank

449
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
you

450
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,959
[Applause]

451
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,399
so uh thank you matt for those very

452
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,240
informative comments so uh

453
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
now

454
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,199
in to me some of what you said reflects

455
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
a recognition of the limitations

456
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,279
in the existing legal system at least

457
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,040
has it been applied

458
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
before right because

459
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,399
you said you know there's been a lot of

460
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,720
movements and and we've seen this i

461
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
think especially after the dnc hacking

462
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
in 2016

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,959
to indict and attempt to prosecute

464
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
um individuals

465
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
involved in these kinds of activities

466
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,759
residing abroad but you also

467
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
began to outline for us a more proactive

468
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,199
approach right and that to me again

469
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,720
seems to suggest that there's a

470
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
recognition of limitations with

471
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
indictments and what's interesting um

472
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
that uh something that you said that

473
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,959
really caught my eye

474
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,279
is this notion that you're interested in

475
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,480
preventing

476
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
offense activity so that to me is really

477
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
interesting because in in in my research

478
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
for example i'm interested in how legal

479
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639
doctrine uh interacts with strategic

480
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
doctrine and by speaking of prevention

481
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,199
you're starting to invoke questions

482
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,400
about deterrence and conflict prevention

483
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
and so forth so

484
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
i was wondering if you could

485
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
say a little bit about how in your

486
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,760
office

487
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
you have

488
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,400
tried to align the work that you do in

489
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,640
terms of indictments and prosecutions

490
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,359
and and proactive activity aligning that

491
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,160
with

492
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
uh diplomatic efforts um with the

493
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
department of state for example

494
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
yeah thank you for that question and and

495
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,480
it is the case that in in in and i think

496
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
that that we are one part of a broader

497
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
ecosystem and there are limitations to

498
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
what we can do based on our ability to

499
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
prosecute investigate and prosecute uh

500
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
individuals who break the law uh break

501
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
our violate our criminal laws and so we

502
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
are always looking for ways obviously

503
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,600
just like we've learned from the

504
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
counterterrorism fight the goal really

505
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
is to prevent uh these acts from taking

506
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
place to begin with right not just to

507
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
investigate and prosecute them when they

508
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
when they occur

509
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
um so we work very closely with the

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
state department to your question lucas

511
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
so and i'll give you a a and as well as

512
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,400
with the defense department and their

513
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
capabilities and the treasury department

514
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
which i also mentioned i'll give you an

515
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
example from last year i mentioned the

516
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
solar winds attack that was carried out

517
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
by russian intelligence

518
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
in april of last year the president

519
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
announced

520
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,559
a series of actions uh to sanction

521
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,640
uh russian actors in connection with

522
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
that uh sanctions uh meaning that you

523
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
know no

524
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,760
that u.s companies cannot do business or

525
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
cannot interact with those sanctioned

526
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
entities and it included six technology

527
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
companies in russia that supported the

528
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
work of the intelligence services

529
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
in addition to announcing those

530
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
sanctions and and i should say

531
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
what we do in the justice department is

532
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
that we enforce those sanctions so

533
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
treasury and state have the authority to

534
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,240
impose the sanctions to name the

535
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
sanctioned entities the justice

536
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
department then can prosecute any entity

537
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
any individual or company that violates

538
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
those sanctions by doing business with

539
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
those sanctioned companies obviously

540
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
this is something that we're doing right

541
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,520
now with respect to russian oligarchs

542
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
in addition at the same time the fbi and

543
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
the department of homeland security uh

544
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,640
uh

545
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
named uh this as a russian attack and

546
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
and gave

547
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
uh warnings and advice to the private

548
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
sector on how to how to remediate so i

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
think the solar winds attack and the way

550
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
we responded to it sort of starts to

551
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,559
give a picture of a series of actions

552
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
that different

553
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,679
legal authorities allow different

554
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,200
departments to take

555
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
that start to build

556
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
uh knowledge resilience um and

557
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
prevention and deterrence into a broader

558
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
strategy

559
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,039
yeah it really is important i think also

560
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,120
to emphasize the more proactive approach

561
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,559
that you've taken because

562
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
let's be honest about it if i were a

563
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
russian um state or private uh criminal

564
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
based inside russia and i were indicted

565
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
by your office i very well might print

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
that out and hang it on my wall as a

567
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,679
mark of distinction right but now with

568
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,200
the more proactive approach and also

569
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
with the closer coordination with the

570
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
department of state and pursuing other

571
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
diplomatic avenues well then the world

572
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
starts to close in on me a bit more

573
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
correct

574
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
okay so thank you for that thank you

575
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
next we will turn to andrea who will

576
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
discuss the italian police forces

577
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,679
efforts to combat extremist exploitation

578
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,200
of the internet

579
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
okay thank you very much uh it's an

580
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
honor to be here i have to say that it

581
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
would be easier for me to face a group

582
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,880
of terrorists that this audience so it's

583
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
not

584
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
it's not something i'm used to i'll try

585
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,000
to do my best

586
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
i'll um

587
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
i'll deal with the non-state violent

588
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
actors predation leaders terrorist

589
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
organizations terrorists in general

590
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
because this has been my work for the

591
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
last 20 years as

592
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
lucas mentioned

593
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
and

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
essentially the

595
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
internet was a game changer for

596
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,480
terrorism because it allowed terrorist

597
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
organizations to

598
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
control channels of distribution of

599
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,640
propaganda of ideology

600
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
and this was something that they

601
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
couldn't do before because they had to

602
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
rely on traditional media that they

603
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,120
couldn't control

604
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
so

605
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,559
i'll try to

606
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,360
provide you with an overview of how

607
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
terrorists

608
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
has managed to

609
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
find new opportunities and how the legal

610
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
tools that are available to governments

611
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
and states were developed

612
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,520
uh

613
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
in in association with iterations of the

614
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
innovations by terrorist organizations

615
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
and counter innovations by governments

616
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
and security agencies

617
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,280
so let's start from uh beginning

618
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
the first iteration of this uh

619
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
innovation country innovation that is

620
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
the centralized control so the beginning

621
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,159
the terrorist organizations uh managed

622
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,880
to

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
exploit the internet as a new channel

624
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
challenge for a channel for uh for

625
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
radicalization

626
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,919
using a forum terrorist forum this was

627
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,640
done by al-qaeda in iraq in 2003 more or

628
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
less when they established forum

629
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,559
that they directly controlled these four

630
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,720
were important not only because they

631
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,520
were used to uh as a

632
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
to publish propaganda so to to spread

633
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,679
their radical and extremist ideologies

634
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
but also because they allowed

635
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
terrorist organizations to move

636
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,159
communities

637
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
from the physical world to the virtual

638
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
world so uh before the

639
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
the uh obviously the the other the other

640
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,400
there are two pillars in the

641
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
legalization one is ideology the the

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,799
other are networks so it's important

643
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,280
face-to-face relations

644
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
now it became

645
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,799
increasingly more difficult for for

646
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,799
al-qaeda to have this

647
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
face-to-face interaction in phys the

648
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,520
physical world after 2001. so they

649
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,919
managed to move these iterations

650
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,320
interactions with their supporters from

651
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
the physical to the virtual world

652
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,200
so in these forums they

653
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
they

654
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,760
they

655
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,919
were important for radicalizations and

656
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,840
after radicalization they also provide

657
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
services like

658
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
terrorist training and terrorist

659
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,640
recruiting

660
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
so they were essentially in this uh they

661
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
were like conveyor belt in which

662
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,840
supporters entered as just like a

663
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,400
supported and were and produced

664
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
terrorists

665
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
now what was the legal response to this

666
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,559
uh to this challenge so the new

667
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,400
challenge because before 2001

668
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,080
essentially radicalization occur

669
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,240
occurred in the physical world

670
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,559
was the application of the

671
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,200
traditional uh criminal law to this new

672
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,679
reality obviously this

673
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,240
this criminal law had to be adapted to

674
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
the to this new challenge for example

675
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,760
training was before uh before the

676
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
internet was conducted essentially face

677
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
to face while in the internet for

678
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
example

679
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
the trainer can just put the upload

680
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,200
terrorist manual and videos and then the

681
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,159
trainees can download them and train on

682
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,480
their own so the legislation had to be

683
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
adapted to a different kind of

684
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,480
criminal conducts

685
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
here you can see you can see the an

686
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,039
operation we conducted in rome my team

687
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
conducting roma against

688
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,159
two people

689
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
that run and manage the

690
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
jihadi website that was used also to

691
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
recruit people in 2012 2013

692
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,760
and

693
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,159
through the forum they managed to put in

694
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,440
contact

695
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,559
volunteers for syria with japanese that

696
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
was essentially enough shot of al-qaeda

697
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,960
in iraq at that time

698
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
so the second

699
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,520
iterations of this cycle of innovation

700
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,799
country innovation was the

701
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
decentralization because it was

702
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
increasingly difficult for terrorist

703
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
organizations to manage directly forums

704
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,240
so they essentially

705
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
this was isis in 2014 more or less

706
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,120
they asked they support

707
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,159
their supporters to establish networks

708
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
exploiting the rising use of the social

709
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,559
media

710
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
and to the use these networks to spread

711
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,480
propaganda and for radicalization so in

712
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
with this new threat the traditional

713
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,320
response was useless because it was

714
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,279
impossible to investigate all these

715
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
people we are talking about around 50

716
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
000

717
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,159
al qaeda supporters isis supporters each

718
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,720
one were actively involved in this

719
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
operation of using the internet for

720
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,919
uh for terrorist purposes

721
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
so uh what what was the response

722
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
in

723
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,799
let's say started in 2015 2016.

724
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,320
the response was to involve

725
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,440
internet companies so internet companies

726
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,520
that manage this platform that was

727
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
abused by terrorists

728
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,320
in this case uh the uh essentially they

729
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
use the social media and

730
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
um

731
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,440
i mean the eu i'm talking also about

732
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,279
europol that had a

733
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,120
leading role in this

734
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
encounter with this phenomenon

735
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,720
they asked

736
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,039
these companies to take responsibilities

737
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,120
for what was published in their

738
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,679
platforms so initially they don't want

739
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,840
to do that because for them the

740
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,440
responsibility was

741
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520
was not theirs but where the use the

742
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
users were responsible for for for the

743
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
content published

744
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
but especially when isis started

745
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,480
publishing videos of behaving if you

746
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
remember of uh american and british

747
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,840
citizens then they decided to

748
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
cooperate with uh with this uh with the

749
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
security agencies

750
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,520
so uh essentially the system worked like

751
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
that uh the states including italy

752
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
established the internal referral units

753
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
that were that essentially tried to

754
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,400
identify material material and accounts

755
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
that were used to spread terrorist

756
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,760
propaganda

757
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,399
the

758
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,919
this i i i are you

759
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,559
they referred this uh this content to

760
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,960
the platform that removed them

761
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
and now this was a voluntary cooperation

762
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
by internet companies but in 2021

763
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
the eu issued the regulation in which

764
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,360
this cooperation is now mandatory so

765
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,880
internet companies are required to

766
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,320
remove

767
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,640
terrorist content to close the accounts

768
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
used by terrorists

769
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,399
uh in one hour after being reported so

770
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,799
it's very short time very short time so

771
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,039
the beginning was voluntary now it was

772
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,159
uh so in this case we see you see that

773
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,640
the response to this kind of views of

774
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,480
the internet was shifted from uh

775
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
essentially uh investigating arresting

776
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,799
and prosecuting people uh to uh

777
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
preventing people from preventing people

778
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
uh terrorists from exploiting the

779
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,919
internet

780
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,880
uh in the third phase that uh it's the

781
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
new one let's say so and it's the

782
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
emerging threat is the exploitation of

783
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
this free speech so

784
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
beforehand i mentioned the fact that

785
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
terrorists

786
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,679
use the

787
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,559
forum or

788
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,520
social media to spread and publish

789
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
propaganda terrorist propaganda there

790
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,760
was clearly terrorists i mean it was

791
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
behaving video debian video terrorist

792
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,840
attacks videos of the inciting people

793
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,480
to commit terrorist attacks in western

794
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,240
countries so it was uh it was uh clearly

795
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,120
terrorist material and illegal material

796
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
but anyway in

797
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,399
in the same years some uh some people

798
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,880
started to exploit uh freedom of

799
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
spiritual in our society

800
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,960
to

801
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
to

802
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
spread

803
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
extremist ideologies without inciting

804
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
clearly to

805
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,640
to terrorism so in this case they wanted

806
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,840
to avoid being labeled as terrorists

807
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,559
at least legally but they obtained the

808
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,919
same results so they use these platforms

809
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,000
to radicalize people

810
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,880
and

811
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
for example in italy we

812
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,240
we

813
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,279
arrested the

814
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
important islamist preacher that

815
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
established in

816
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,960
in 2015 more or less a website

817
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,039
which had a on surface was not illegal

818
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,159
but was used then in a deeper at a

819
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
deeper level to recruit people for for

820
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,200
the jihad in in syria and iraq

821
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,679
now the problem with the exploitation of

822
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
the free speech for extremism to spread

823
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,760
extremism is that

824
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
the traditional legal tool criminal

825
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
legal tool cannot be used because they

826
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,679
it's

827
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,360
it's difficult to

828
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,240
to

829
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,760
criminalize

830
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
extremism because it's difficult to

831
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,799
define to give a definition of extremism

832
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,520
and

833
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,080
obviously there is a danger of uh

834
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,000
harming one of the

835
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,320
fundamental rights in our societies so

836
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
the freedom of speech however these

837
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
access networks represent a serious

838
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,080
threat because from these networks uh

839
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,760
periodically emerge

840
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,880
uh

841
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,279
threats terrorists so it's not like

842
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
before in which terrorists produce

843
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,279
extremism in like uh there was the the

844
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,480
the the aims of the the aim of the

845
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
al-qaeda and islamic state now terrorism

846
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,840
is produced by extremism so beforehand

847
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,080
we had a top-down approach in which

848
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
radicalization was stopped down now

849
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,960
radicalization is bottom-up so it uh

850
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
terrorist emerges from so for example we

851
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,440
had

852
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
in italy we had

853
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,640
one of these people that

854
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
shot at immigrants when you in it was uh

855
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,720
after reading material in the internet

856
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
and social media that

857
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,960
uh consider immigrants as a as a

858
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
threat for italy as a threat and then

859
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
uh

860
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,559
try to kill them in uh in 2018 and this

861
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,960
uh person that was luca trainee was a

862
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,679
role model for for example the the chris

863
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,919
church shooter in new zealand but also

864
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,080
from the recent

865
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,519
responsible

866
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,919
of shooting in taxes

867
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,200
so

868
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,760
and also these networks produce produce

869
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
also different kind of security threats

870
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,559
for example related to the recruiting

871
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,279
mercenaries for uh the donbass

872
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,039
so in 2018 we conducted an investigation

873
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,320
in which at the end of this

874
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,200
investigation whereas six people for uh

875
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
being

876
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,559
mercenaries and for fighting with

877
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,039
russian synd in donbass

878
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,320
and

879
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
apart from

880
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,200
that this was a non-terrorist threat but

881
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,480
always it it can produce and there is a

882
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
raising consciousness that these people

883
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
when returning to italy may represent

884
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
also a security threat

885
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,799
and these people also use the

886
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
internet to uh

887
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,159
to spread

888
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,200
the russian narrative on the conflict

889
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,080
uh now what is the response to this kind

890
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,640
of uh presence of cr virtua virtual

891
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,600
community response was to use the the uh

892
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,080
internet companies the term terms of

893
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,640
services against in these networks we

894
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
couldn't have we cannot have a legal uh

895
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
i mean a criminalization of eczema

896
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
because of the danger of

897
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,120
censorship

898
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,399
and so we

899
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,760
we

900
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,799
we use the term of services i mentioned

901
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,519
i copied one in the slide that uh

902
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,600
forbids the use of the platforms to

903
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
spread hatred towards other groups in

904
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,799
order to uh

905
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,600
to

906
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,240
and to collaborate to cooperate with the

907
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,279
internet companies and close

908
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,480
accounts

909
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,080
and delete content that are not illegal

910
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,880
but extremists anyway so you see you can

911
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
see there an operation conducted by

912
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
europol and other countries in which

913
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,399
they used the term services they

914
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,959
reported

915
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,919
legal but extremist accounts

916
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
to the internet companies i mean the

917
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,480
police this internet referral unit and

918
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
this content and these accounts were

919
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
closed and removed

920
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,399
so just to sum up uh i've i tried to uh

921
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,440
to

922
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
to provide you with a with an overview

923
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
of how the legislation legal tool

924
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,120
developed

925
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,320
in in cycles of innovations and country

926
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
innovation

927
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
and

928
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,119
as i mentioned it all started with the

929
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,199
application of criminal law then it

930
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,879
shifted to a more preventative

931
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,159
regulation and then to the uh to the use

932
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,239
of the thermal services which is not a

933
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,399
public laws speaking

934
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,679
against extremism uh as a there are

935
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,679
probably just to

936
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,079
to conclude my presentation three trends

937
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,639
that can be identified in this uh in

938
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,079
these

939
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
i mean uh cycles that is that they shift

940
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,079
from national legislation to

941
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,399
international legislation

942
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,839
they shift

943
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,199
from prosecution to prevention

944
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,280
and the shift for from

945
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
a i mean in institutional response based

946
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,200
on security agencies to the involvement

947
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,320
of private companies and also i would

948
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,480
mention the civil society

949
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,490
thank you very much for your attention

950
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:15,200
[Applause]

951
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
uh thank you very much andrea for those

952
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,920
comments now i want to take the

953
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,079
opportunity of having someone with your

954
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,440
extraordinary

955
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
experience

956
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,800
and understanding of institutions to ask

957
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
you a question about

958
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
organizational reform

959
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,240
because

960
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,000
much of what you said reminded me of a

961
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
common distinction within the academic

962
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
literature on governmental reform

963
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
between the effectiveness of an

964
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
institution

965
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,000
which denotes its ability to achieve its

966
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
stated objectives

967
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
and the institutions robustness

968
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
which is about

969
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,359
evolving changing the institutions so

970
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,400
that it can address new objectives that

971
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
it was not originally designed

972
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,200
to achieve and

973
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
in this regard i think it's notable that

974
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,320
you said that

975
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
innovation often happens

976
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,079
from the bottom

977
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,800
up

978
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
this is certainly true as you pointed

979
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,480
out in the presentation in the second

980
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,720
phase right of the on the criminal side

981
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,599
of the divide with um the

982
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,359
decentralization that happens so

983
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,320
i'm interested in knowing uh more about

984
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,359
how

985
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,599
your own organization in the police

986
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,359
force which is traditionally

987
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,480
hierarchical

988
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,520
right a top-down organization and others

989
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,960
like it were able to innovate

990
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
right um

991
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
without necessarily inverting the

992
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
hierarchy

993
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,040
yeah

994
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
well it's

995
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,119
a responsibility it was a very

996
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,040
interesting way to understand the

997
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,599
innovator i mentioned another aspect i'm

998
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,720
interested in intelligence because i i

999
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,599
just

1000
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,760
the the problem is that obviously

1001
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,720
you know

1002
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
in general talking about

1003
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
management organizational management

1004
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
decentralized organizations are more

1005
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,359
able to innovate than centralized and

1006
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,280
hierarchical organizations so it's not

1007
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,880
easy for the police

1008
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
as an institution and especially i think

1009
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
a military institution to to innovate

1010
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,560
because

1011
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,920
uh i mean we we more tend to be on the

1012
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
traditional

1013
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,280
side i mean we we more rely on tradition

1014
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
we we

1015
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
especially institutions they public

1016
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
citizens are fierce of

1017
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,599
losing the appeal they have on public

1018
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,800
opinion if they innovate if they change

1019
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
so this is a an aspect

1020
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
i think that a

1021
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
terrorist organization were incredibly

1022
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,760
good at innovating uh because of this uh

1023
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,560
uh

1024
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,800
the the bottom up i mean uh

1025
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,680
innovation so that it was it wasn't them

1026
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,359
it wasn't our terrorist organization

1027
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,480
that decided to use

1028
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
a social media platform

1029
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,000
their supporters

1030
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,640
when started to use them and then this

1031
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,200
organization accepted and exploited this

1032
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,040
innovation that was introduced by

1033
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,119
supporters so how can we counter this uh

1034
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,320
this uh this ability to innovate i think

1035
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
that we have been very good at

1036
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,160
innovating but a little bit slow so uh i

1037
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,359
think that in general it's important

1038
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,760
to anticipate these terrorist

1039
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,680
innovations they anticipate

1040
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,839
opportunities for example a few days ago

1041
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,960
it was in the hague and talked about at

1042
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,040
a checked web meeting the meeting of

1043
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,119
europe and we must

1044
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,440
start thinking about how terrorists

1045
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
could exploit the matterers how could

1046
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
they spread blockchain technology how

1047
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,040
could it exploit

1048
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
uh

1049
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,880
for example decentralized platforms

1050
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
before they really start using

1051
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,160
them because for example social media

1052
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,800
took four years in order to

1053
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,839
to respond in an effective way so we

1054
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,200
analysis and forecast is very important

1055
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
and the other factor that is important

1056
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,119
for institution public institution is

1057
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,079
that

1058
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
the the private

1059
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
we mentioned that public private

1060
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,920
cooperation and also the cooperation

1061
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
with the academic world must be

1062
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,599
developed so it's difficult it means

1063
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
the solution must

1064
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,000
develop within the organization process

1065
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,839
of innovation but they also can import

1066
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,680
them from the outside so that's an

1067
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,880
interesting idea if you can't

1068
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
necessarily invert the hierarchy in

1069
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
order to spur innovation you can at

1070
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
least branch out horizontally rather

1071
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,640
than virtually yeah i mean this is uh in

1072
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
general in the business world is uh one

1073
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
dogma that is the centralized

1074
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
organization are more able to innovate

1075
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,160
that's and then higher critical ones so

1076
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,920
i think the the challenge implied in my

1077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,800
question applies to um the organizations

1078
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
of our other two speakers it may be a

1079
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
question that we will return to uh later

1080
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,040
uh but next uh i want to turn to helen

1081
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,880
who will discuss measures to combat war

1082
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
propaganda

1083
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,839
and hate speech in estonia emanating

1084
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,240
largely from across the border to the

1085
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,720
east i imagine

1086
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,000
hi thank you for inviting me

1087
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
we are definitely not experienced as my

1088
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
co-panelists

1089
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
but i would like to give you a short

1090
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,560
overview of what we have done regarding

1091
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
the russian

1092
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,240
war propaganda and age speech online but

1093
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,319
firstly

1094
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,040
i would like to

1095
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,880
share with you how propaganda works

1096
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,359
propaganda is aimed to cause confusion

1097
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,119
panic and fear

1098
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,119
and shape people's opinion about enemy

1099
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
this may be done by

1100
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,520
simple name calling the most well-known

1101
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
russian narratives in ukraine have been

1102
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,359
that ukrainians are

1103
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,800
russophobes

1104
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
fascists and nazis

1105
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
russians have been scared with the

1106
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
thought that ukraine but going further

1107
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,760
the whole western world is planning to

1108
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,839
attack russia

1109
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,920
nato's continued presence in eastern

1110
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,359
europe

1111
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,839
is a clear evidence of this that is in

1112
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,400
the opinion of russia of course

1113
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,760
and russia must stand uh for its uh

1114
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,280
geopolitical interest in the region

1115
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
russia needs to protect ethnic russians

1116
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
from discrimination and in foreign

1117
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,680
countries like in ukraine but the same

1118
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,599
narrative has been used

1119
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,839
in regard to baltic states

1120
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,480
and tons of fake news have been produced

1121
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,200
to illustrate this narrative

1122
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,040
uh therefore to protect russia russia's

1123
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,920
interests and fellow russians living in

1124
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,119
ukraine it is important to to militarize

1125
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,560
and densify ukraine

1126
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,319
now here's a great example how

1127
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,440
symbols are used in propaganda

1128
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,359
this poster was published in grammar

1129
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,079
prior to grammy and status referendum

1130
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,800
in march 2014.

1131
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,599
it carries a easy and understandable

1132
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
message either you

1133
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,720
see your bright future with russia

1134
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
or you support the nazis that being

1135
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,119
ukrainian government

1136
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
propaganda messages need to be camped

1137
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,040
simple they are

1138
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,760
to attract masses

1139
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,680
to many of you this poster might not

1140
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
affect your decision making but i think

1141
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,760
we need to understand that something

1142
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,280
like this is never the

1143
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,599
first propaganda message before that

1144
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,319
it's necessary to prepare audience

1145
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,520
that is to spread this information

1146
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,839
on alleged discrimination of ethnic

1147
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,160
russians but also undermine the local

1148
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
government

1149
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,079
in case of ukraine and also many other

1150
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,480
former soviet republics

1151
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
slow but increasingly more aggressive

1152
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,720
information operations have taken base

1153
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,959
since the collapse of soviet union

1154
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,200
kremlin emphasizes on a crucial role of

1155
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,599
information and psychological operations

1156
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,280
in spread of uh confusion of milit

1157
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
in the spread of uh

1158
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,720
in regard preparation and conduct of

1159
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
military actions

1160
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,800
the corruption of doctrine is named

1161
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,640
after the chief of general staff of

1162
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,079
russian

1163
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,800
armed forces valerie gerasimov and

1164
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,480
became widely known in 2013

1165
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
when he published his article in which

1166
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,800
he emphasizes the importance of

1167
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,160
non-military

1168
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
components of modern warfare estimating

1169
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,200
the ratio of non-military

1170
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,880
measures against the military to be

1171
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,319
fourth one

1172
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,400
even the chief editor of russia today

1173
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
margarita simonian has publicly

1174
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,480
recognized state-owned or controlled

1175
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,319
media being part of russia's weapon

1176
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,880
arsenal

1177
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,760
so the question rises should

1178
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,560
such media outlets

1179
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,839
freedom of

1180
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,160
expression be unconditionally

1181
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,359
respected

1182
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,880
and should freedom to receive

1183
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
information from these sources speak

1184
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,640
guaranteed

1185
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,480
of course freedom of expression still

1186
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,040
needs to be respected but it's important

1187
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,359
to remember that with every freedom

1188
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,520
comes responsibility

1189
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
freedom of expression must must be

1190
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,440
exercised responsibly

1191
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,760
respecting the rights of others

1192
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
it is important to understand that at

1193
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,560
the moment the same values we so highly

1194
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
cherish democracy and freedom of spread

1195
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,680
speech are actually used as web as

1196
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,800
weapon weapons against us

1197
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,240
we need to preserve and protect

1198
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,319
democracy against russia's destructive

1199
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,920
policy

1200
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
freedom of expression should not be

1201
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
unconditionally respected in case

1202
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,240
national security public safety and

1203
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,960
rights of others are at risk

1204
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,359
and of course it is important to

1205
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,800
understand that

1206
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,640
every restriction still needs to be

1207
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,400
lawful necessary and proportionate

1208
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,200
but spreading more propaganda is clearly

1209
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,440
prohibited by international convention

1210
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
of civil and political rights adopted by

1211
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,280
the un

1212
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,680
european union council framework

1213
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,040
decision

1214
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,680
on combating certain forms of expression

1215
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,160
on racism and xenophobia by means of

1216
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
criminal law clearly states that member

1217
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,720
states need to criminalize public

1218
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,520
inciting to violence and hatred direct

1219
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
against directed against group of person

1220
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,160
or a person defined by

1221
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,280
reference to race color religion

1222
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,920
decent or national or ethnic origin

1223
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
in estonia both spreading war propaganda

1224
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,040
incitement to hatred are criminalized

1225
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,760
but until february this year we were

1226
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
extremely liberal

1227
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,240
we never before restricted access based

1228
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,800
on the content of media service

1229
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,200
we believed we believed in people's

1230
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
media's literacy skills even in the

1231
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,119
first of times

1232
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,119
now speaking of the worst of times

1233
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,200
here you can see

1234
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,599
events from 2007 that took place in

1235
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,280
tallinn

1236
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,359
we called it bronze knights or april

1237
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,480
unrest

1238
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,319
estonian government has decided to

1239
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,200
relocate soviet world war ii memorial

1240
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,760
from the city center to the to the

1241
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,880
defense forces cemetery in tallinn

1242
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,200
the decision was also widely broadcasted

1243
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,760
in russian media often in a hostile

1244
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,880
manner

1245
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,000
accusing estonians of being brussophobic

1246
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,400
and discriminating at the russians

1247
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,040
community in estonia

1248
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,760
we did not restrict any access to any

1249
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,599
websites or

1250
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,319
media or web or tv channels before

1251
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,800
during or after these events

1252
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,000
although it was clear that russian media

1253
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
challenged by no means eased the

1254
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,599
tensions

1255
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,599
on the contrary according to estonian

1256
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,400
international security services russian

1257
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,599
media help escalating the events

1258
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,240
this experience from 2007 made us more

1259
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,319
cautious this time around

1260
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,240
knowing how large russian-speaking

1261
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,560
minority in estonia is and how many of

1262
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,359
them consume gremlin propaganda on a

1263
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,880
daily basis

1264
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,520
we realized that the events of 2007

1265
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,200
might repeat themselves

1266
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,200
so what did we actually do

1267
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,480
uh

1268
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,960
to target russian propaganda

1269
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,079
uh we temporarily restricted access to

1270
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,319
seven tv channels this was done by

1271
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,760
issuing preceptor electronic

1272
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,599
communication undertakings

1273
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,680
re-transmitting those tv channels

1274
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,359
you may ask why for 12 months

1275
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,160
well

1276
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,599
our

1277
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,640
reasoning behind that was that

1278
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,040
it can be assumed that the acute period

1279
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,119
of russia's attack against ukraine and

1280
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,040
the active cognitive war that might

1281
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,000
follow might take at least 12 months but

1282
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,520
this might be prolonged

1283
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,880
now about the legal grounds legal

1284
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,240
grounds for

1285
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,319
our decision came from the audio-visual

1286
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,119
media services directive

1287
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,440
the directive states as a principle that

1288
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,359
the reception and returns mission of

1289
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,599
media services shall not be

1290
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,119
restricted however member states may in

1291
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,880
may provisionally derogate from this

1292
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,880
principle in case the media service

1293
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,720
presents a serious or grave risk to

1294
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,640
public security

1295
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,400
including the safeguarding of national

1296
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,480
security and defense

1297
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,240
taking into account the significant

1298
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,400
russian-speaking minority in estonia and

1299
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
decreasing aggressive propaganda spread

1300
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,200
by channels in western we found that

1301
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,440
these channels present a serious and

1302
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,559
great risk to public security

1303
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,559
but

1304
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,200
besides tv channels available through

1305
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,119
television there were many websites

1306
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,839
which made it possible to to watch tv

1307
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,000
broadcasting

1308
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,960
and

1309
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
already restricted under the audio

1310
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,359
visual media services and there also

1311
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,000
were some news portals inciting hatred

1312
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,240
and spreading war propaganda

1313
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,079
therefore we needed to

1314
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,319
restrict access to websites

1315
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,160
this was done by issuing precept to

1316
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,079
internet service providers to block

1317
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,839
respective domains

1318
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,720
domain names in domain servers

1319
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,680
again we had not the websites have not

1320
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,400
been

1321
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,599
blocked permanently but the restrictions

1322
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,880
are set for 12 months

1323
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,599
legal grounds for these decisions came

1324
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,280
from domestic law

1325
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,280
as i previously previously mentioned

1326
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
both spreading pro-propaganda and in

1327
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,599
statement of incitement of hatred are

1328
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,680
criminalized in estonia

1329
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,839
in it in addition supporting and

1330
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,040
justifying cr international crime with

1331
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,559
symbols such as that or b letters or the

1332
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,119
same choices ribbon for example are

1333
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,280
criminalized in estonia

1334
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,160
those amendments the last months

1335
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,000
entered into force in the april this

1336
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,440
year

1337
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,920
and as as we are responsible for the

1338
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,880
public order in internet it was our duty

1339
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,920
to

1340
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
to make sure that those websites are

1341
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,200
blocked in estonia

1342
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,119
now about the impact of these our

1343
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,440
decisions it is still early days to talk

1344
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,839
about long-term impact of our decisions

1345
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,559
but it at least we can see some positive

1346
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,760
outcomes

1347
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,680
we can see that credibility of russian

1348
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,359
media has fallen

1349
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,440
and daily share of our russian language

1350
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
public broadcasting channel has

1351
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
increased significantly

1352
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,680
of course it will be naive from me to

1353
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,520
say that this is solely the result of

1354
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,960
our decisions

1355
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
the beginning of war and the shameless

1356
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
this information published in russian

1357
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,200
channels has helped us to has helped

1358
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,280
open the eyes of some keen followers

1359
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,520
as a national regulatory authority of

1360
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,119
audio visual media services we can also

1361
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,640
say that

1362
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,040
there is an noticeable increase among

1363
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,440
our media service providers

1364
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,280
to start new russian language channels

1365
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,160
in estonia

1366
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,160
but i think we need to bear in mind that

1367
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,640
banning something is never the solely a

1368
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,839
good

1369
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,720
good solution in a long-term view

1370
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,480
there are hundreds of tv channels and

1371
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
thousands of websites we will never be

1372
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,440
able to

1373
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,839
effectively effectively ban them all

1374
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,160
thus we need to get to the roots of the

1375
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,240
problem and work on media literacy

1376
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,280
skills

1377
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,520
in addition i think we need to offer

1378
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,920
alternative content russian speakers

1379
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,559
in and in conclusion i think it's

1380
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,720
important to understand that the same

1381
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,960
values as i already said

1382
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,359
democracy and freedom expressions are

1383
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,680
being used against us as weapons right

1384
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,359
now

1385
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,240
and

1386
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
i think it's crucial for nato and all

1387
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
the members of the alliance to draw

1388
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,480
appropriate conclusions from the ongoing

1389
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,040
conflict in europe which has shown that

1390
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,680
to us the importance of information

1391
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,440
warfare

1392
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,480
and

1393
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,200
it is important to input to improve

1394
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,599
improve our level of preparedness

1395
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,960
to respond to the challenges of the 24th

1396
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,839
for 21st century warfare

1397
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,319
so thank you

1398
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,520
uh thank you helen so the establishment

1399
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,599
of etv2 strikes me as one of those

1400
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,920
proactive kind of measures

1401
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,040
that uh of the kind uh well very

1402
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,640
different kind of proactive measure than

1403
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,839
the ones matt

1404
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,079
was discussing but it's that kind of new

1405
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,480
thinking trying to go beyond the legal

1406
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,040
restrictions that uh exist now hearing

1407
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,400
your comments i am um

1408
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,119
you know reminded of this intrinsic but

1409
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,200
perhaps not insurmountable tension that

1410
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,319
exists

1411
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,200
between the necessity to curtail certain

1412
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,960
forms of speech

1413
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,839
and the imperative to protect it right

1414
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,599
it's a tension that spares autocracies

1415
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
but that is inherent in a democratic

1416
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,880
society

1417
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,000
like estonia and just synthesizing one

1418
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
thing that andrea was saying earlier

1419
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,920
because you andrea you were discussing

1420
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,440
the

1421
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,800
cooperation

1422
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,599
voluntarily of the private sector this

1423
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,440
tension of course comes to the fore when

1424
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,960
the private sector

1425
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
is not so willing to cooperate and we

1426
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,400
know from experience that that can

1427
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,680
happen i mean i'm thinking of the 2015

1428
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,240
contention between apple and the fbi yes

1429
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,920
that was not a free speech issue but it

1430
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
related to uh privacy and the decryption

1431
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,160
of uh

1432
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,920
personal device of a

1433
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,280
terrorist right so i'm wondering if um

1434
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,599
mindful of that larger tension i'm

1435
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,119
wondering if you could say something

1436
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,559
about how to manage it in situations

1437
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,559
where for example the large

1438
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,160
multinational

1439
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,119
social media companies might not be

1440
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,440
so cooperative in curtailing activities

1441
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,760
within their forums yeah thank you for a

1442
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,000
great question i think it's definitely a

1443
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,319
problem

1444
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,400
how to restrict

1445
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,240
freedom of expressions but also to

1446
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,839
respect it and regarding big social

1447
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,240
media platforms in late at least with

1448
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
what we can see in this

1449
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,040
ukraine crisis is that google for

1450
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,520
example has been very cooperative with

1451
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,319
us

1452
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,280
but

1453
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,319
in a long-term view i think that we have

1454
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,799
legal challenges in front of us

1455
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,160
in the european union level we are

1456
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,880
talking about

1457
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,599
some legal

1458
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,160
some new legal acts that might help with

1459
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,240
us but um

1460
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,720
i think that what we can see right now

1461
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,960
is that the social media platforms are

1462
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,960
also thinking about this problem and

1463
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,880
they are very cooperative with the

1464
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,000
governments and i think it's just an uh

1465
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,920
question of time where we can find a

1466
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,640
solution but it will take time and we

1467
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,760
are prepared to work on that

1468
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,480
well

1469
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,240
we researchers will be watching you very

1470
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,680
closely

1471
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,480
so

1472
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,400
by my clock we started two minutes late

1473
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,559
so i'm going to take the liberty as

1474
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,599
moderator to take us over by two minutes

1475
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,520
which gives us four minutes for

1476
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,520
questions

1477
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,400
uh my name is dhruv uk private sector

1478
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,599
cyber security technology provider

1479
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,760
my question is for the assistant

1480
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,119
attorney general

1481
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,920
in the two examples you had where the

1482
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,400
emails were compromised and so on

1483
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,480
what to get over the line for your

1484
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,520
office

1485
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,400
from

1486
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,040
considering these just as an acceptable

1487
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,319
level of espionage

1488
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,000
yes um

1489
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,880
the the two examples i gave you by that

1490
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,559
the two examples i gave where we took

1491
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,280
proactive measures uh hafnium and

1492
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,760
cyclops blink were the two uh that i

1493
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,839
highlighted um

1494
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,200
so look i mean the in in both of those

1495
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,359
cases there was potential for

1496
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,319
significant disruption to

1497
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:29,599
a wide range of private sector actors um

1498
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,680
the the the extent of the of uh with the

1499
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,359
hafnium uh that was which was china

1500
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,920
chinese intelligence actors um cyclops

1501
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,839
blink which was russian military

1502
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,960
intelligence um these were not what we

1503
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,319
would consider to be traditional

1504
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,079
espionage um these were uh they they had

1505
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,240
the potential to be

1506
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,960
disruptive to a wide swath of our

1507
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,640
private sector including critical

1508
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,559
infrastructure uh within the united

1509
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,359
states so that i don't think there was a

1510
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,359
difficult question about whether or not

1511
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,599
there was something to be tolerated here

1512
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,839
and even in the context of what some

1513
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,119
might consider to be traditional

1514
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,599
espionage when we're talking about

1515
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,400
cyber attacks that put at risk critical

1516
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,280
infrastructure or involve

1517
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,839
large amounts of personal data of u.s

1518
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,160
citizens from our perspective

1519
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,839
we're going to be aggressive in

1520
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,839
investigating prosecuting as well as

1521
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,359
taking proactive measures where those

1522
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,680
are available

1523
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,559
so we have time for one more question so

1524
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,400
long as the questioner cooperates

1525
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,359
yeah over here

1526
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,240
thank you pirate bernice ccdcoe and my

1527
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
questions actually follow on uh for the

1528
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,119
previous one and i was wondering uh

1529
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,079
that

1530
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,319
my understanding is that

1531
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,200
in

1532
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,000
both of these takedowns that actually

1533
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,200
fbi accessed infrastructure located on

1534
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,960
the u.s soil but um for example if it's

1535
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,839
a joint task force areas

1536
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,079
operation against isil it was on the

1537
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,960
german soil as well as the previous

1538
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,920
operation or actually uh

1539
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,559
not previous but layer operation um

1540
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,240
against in

1541
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,960
internet research agency in russian soil

1542
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,799
so in this case

1543
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,640
you wouldn't need a court order you

1544
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,480
would have other

1545
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,240
legislation

1546
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,000
that authorizes those actions but

1547
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,839
how do you actually convey this to the

1548
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,680
global audience that

1549
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,160
u.s follows the

1550
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,240
responsible state

1551
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,799
action and and this is a

1552
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,079
different case if you um

1553
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,880
interfere with infrastructure uh do you

1554
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
understand what i mean i i think so i

1555
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,240
mean this is a really it was a really

1556
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,440
important part of with the recent uh

1557
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
uh measures that we took with regard to

1558
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,880
the cyclops blink uh malware because

1559
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,040
that was like all of these cyber attacks

1560
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,319
are not going to be limited to one

1561
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,599
country just by their nature um and when

1562
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,599
we're talking about nation states and so

1563
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,079
with respect to the the russian

1564
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,440
intelligence botnet when we took out the

1565
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,000
command and control layer that was done

1566
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,400
in close partnership with other

1567
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
countries that were facing where we were

1568
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,760
able to identify

1569
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,720
um

1570
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,880
command and control servers in other

1571
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,400
countries the fbi with its partners uh

1572
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,799
in europe and other places uh reached

1573
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,200
out and had conversations as well as

1574
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,760
intelligence agencies to alert those

1575
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,359
countries so that they could take action

1576
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,760
under their laws as necessary but there

1577
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,960
was close cooperation on a multi-lateral

1578
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,839
basis to ensure that this was effective

1579
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,119
because without that level of

1580
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,119
multilateral cooperation of course it

1581
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,040
would be much less effective so it's a

1582
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,720
really important question and maybe we

1583
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,000
can have just a brief comment from

1584
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,359
andrea and helen regarding the

1585
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,680
international dimensions of uh your

1586
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,799
efforts oh it's cool i mean

1587
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,680
it's it is quite obvious that this uh

1588
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,319
they these type of crimes that

1589
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,119
don't have borders don't respect borders

1590
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,559
so it's uh

1591
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,359
essentially we

1592
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,680
at i think european level we have we

1593
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,400
have developed very legal tools for

1594
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,640
example the joining the series team

1595
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,599
because

1596
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,559
uh obviously using m lattice is a very

1597
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,480
slow process right i mean so

1598
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,480
multilateral cooperation is the center

1599
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,200
we do we develop a fantastic operation

1600
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,599
with the fbi which is essential for us

1601
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,040
for example

1602
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,359
quite lately we

1603
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,440
we manage an operation international

1604
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,680
level also in italy on the use of the

1605
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,760
dark web to spread the terrorist

1606
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,040
propaganda

1607
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,040
and for example with

1608
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,520
in order to overcome the obstacles to

1609
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,720
cooperation you uh with mlatt using by

1610
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,400
amlat we we we with the fbi for example

1611
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,960
we conduct parallel investigations and

1612
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,920
we exchange information at the police

1613
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,559
level and then at the end operation we

1614
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,319
we can then

1615
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,040
i mean formally ask the the use of this

1616
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,079
evidence in uh respectively so i mean i

1617
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,359
think

1618
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,160
this is a field in which really

1619
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,920
a lot of the improvements in these in

1620
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,079
late years have have been done i mean in

1621
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,880
terms of level the cooperation obviously

1622
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,640
more more must be

1623
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,160
also done

1624
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,200
and uh

1625
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,760
yeah from our side i think talking about

1626
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,480
the websites what we did was to

1627
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,880
restrict actions from estonia to those

1628
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,520
websites that can be done but uh

1629
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,240
regarding the cooperation between states

1630
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,359
i think it

1631
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,720
in the eu level at least we have a great

1632
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,359
example of uh

1633
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,960
giving sanctions

1634
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,039
uh against those

1635
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,680
media outlets coming from uh

1636
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,280
coming from russia

1637
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,799
therefore

1638
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,960
i think the sanctions is one way but we

1639
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,359
need to find some kind of a good

1640
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,079
solution on how to

1641
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,880
actually restrict access to the source

1642
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,960
and if it's from another state for

1643
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,520
example in this case from russia how can

1644
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,400
we do this from the eu or from the

1645
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,240
from the u.s side

1646
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,760
yeah

1647
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,920
so ladies and gentlemen usually at a

1648
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,079
conference like this given the enormous

1649
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,319
challenges of addressing foreign cyber

1650
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,760
threats i usually try to

1651
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,200
stem any soaring optimism that might

1652
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,839
arise but i think that in the last hour

1653
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,960
we've given we've been given some basis

1654
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,920
for it

1655
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,240
uh discussions about and illustrations

1656
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,039
of how government institutions can

1657
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,000
indeed adapt themselves and mobilize the

1658
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,119
legal arsenal uh to this end so please

1659
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,480
join me in thanking our three speakers

1660
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,760
matt andrea and helen and also

1661
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,880
