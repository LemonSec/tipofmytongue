1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,000
all right good afternoon ladies and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,560
gentlemen my name is aditya mathur and

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
i'll be presenting this technology

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
called safe crit

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,960
and essentially i'll be focusing on

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,000
a

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,080
strategy that we have been using which

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
is to fuse ai and design to protect

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
critical infrastructure the other three

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
author that you see here gotham is one

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
of the guys who

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,480
is an ai expert so some of the work that

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
i'm describing is from gotham siddhant

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
is another expert who's uh who has been

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
looking at our

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
technology for plant protection and

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
tiger and siddhant both have been

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
working on plant protection so let's go

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
here

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
now critical infrastructure i think as

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
you all know i won't go read this thing

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
the u.s patriot act of 2001 actually

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
defined what critical infrastructure is

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,680
water power maritime all these systems

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,879
are in the area of critical

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
infrastructure in itrust we focus on

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,760
water systems treatment systems

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
distribution systems and electric power

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,559
systems in addition to iot devices

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,040
uh just to brief on iot uh nitrous so

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
itrust was launched in 2012 by the

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
ministry of defense in singapore and we

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
had funding from ministry of defense

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,759
2013 to 2018 i trust grew quite a lot we

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,520
had significant funding from national

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
research foundation and pub then 2019 20

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
also saw expansion

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
we had a tech transfer we have

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
transferred some of our license some of

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,960
our technology to a startup in atlanta

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
united states and then in 2021 uh mndf

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
is back in a big way with i trust so now

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
we i trust works very closely with mndf

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
to conduct exercises and develop

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,880
technologies

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
uh itrust

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,119
has focus right from day one 2012 we

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
started our focus was exclusively on the

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,479
defense of critical infrastructure and

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,399
we looked at as i said water treatment

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,600
water distribution and electric power

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
now we have 19 faculty members overall

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,159
in which includes faculty from all the

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,240
four universities higher of

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,479
higher education in singapore

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
about 13 research fellows 12 research

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,520
assistants and nine staff members our

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
focus as i said is design develop and

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
deploy technologies to protect

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
industrial control systems against

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
extreme attacks so as most of you

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
probably know endless industrial control

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
system consists of scada

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
systems engineering workstations hmis

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
that are controlling

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,599
a plant generators valves pumps etc etc

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,480
now

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,120
one of the i would say a unique feature

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
of itrust is our test beds so right from

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
the beginning when we started the center

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,879
we asked ourselves that we are going to

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,800
develop technologies but how are we

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
going to test these technologies of

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
course it is very difficult almost

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
impossible to test a defense technology

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
for critical infrastructure in a real

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
plant for example i cannot go to a real

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
water treatment plant and say hey i

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,480
would like to attack your system and

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,879
test my technology obviously no so what

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,400
we decided was we'll build a test beds

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
that are sort of scaled down versions of

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,159
actual systems and then we will allow

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
our students researchers and our

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
collaborators internationally to

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
actually launch attacks on these systems

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
we'll also allow our researchers to

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,680
integrate their technologies into these

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
systems so that the entire cyber

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
exercise of

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
red teams and blue teams can be

92
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
conducted on these systems so this was i

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
think a very good decision that we made

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
in 2012 and then since then starting

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
from 2015 to about 2018 we have a

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,799
collection of test beds that were

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
created and as you can see here on the

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
top left we have the water treatment

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
plant which is called swat and then on

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,599
the right top right we have a water

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,040
distribution system these two are

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
connected so the water that is treated

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,519
in swot goes into the water distribution

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,440
system and on the bottom left we have a

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
shield we have a shielded room which is

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
an iot room where we can actually

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
conduct complex attacks such as gps

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
spoofing on various devices on the right

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
bottom right we have the electrical

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,640
power

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
grid

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
that is connected to the water treatment

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
plant and the water distribution plant

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
so we can actually launch attacks on

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
one system and look at its impact

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,519
cascading impact on other systems and we

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
have done research published papers on

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
something like this the problem that we

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
are really interested have been right

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
from the beginning in solving is the

121
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
following

122
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,320
so

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
first of all we define something called

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
an extreme cyber attack so an extreme

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
cyber attack is one where the attacker

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
has access to planned controls now how

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
this access has been achieved uh is

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,840
another matter it could be through the

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
network or the guy sitting right in

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,199
front of the computer the guys in

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
another country but he has their uh

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
the access credentials and so it doesn't

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
matter but the access has been achieved

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
and therefore this guy

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,479
has is they had the ability

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,759
to turn on turn off devices like pumps

137
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
generators etc and also to uh manipulate

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,320
the data that is moving on the plant

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
network uh to deceive the controllers

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
and so on so that's an extreme attack

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
okay that's the extreme attack now the

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,120
problem therefore is how to effectively

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
protect a water treatment plant against

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
an extreme cyber attack by the way i'm

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
i'm focusing on a water treatment plant

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
here simply because some of the data

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
that i'll be presenting is from our

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
water treatment plant and also from

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
another public water treatment plant in

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
singapore but the technology in general

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
that we have developed especially the

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
design based technology is applicable to

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
any physical system and we have tried it

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,759
on both water treatment water

155
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
distribution and electric power plant

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
so the existing solutions if you see

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
are

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
you have an asset okay which could be a

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
plant for example and you create

160
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,160
boundaries around those asset okay so

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
the there's a physical perimeter for

162
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,280
example if you go to water treatment

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,039
plant there'll be a physical perimeter

164
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,800
in some cases that's not possible like

165
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
in colonial pipeline the pipeline pipes

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,440
are going thousands of miles and in also

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
in water distribution systems you will

168
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
not be able to put a fair put a physical

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
parameter but in many cases you are able

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,039
to put a physical parameter the other is

171
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
cyber perimeter so you put firewalls

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
network intrusion detection systems etc

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
and then you have management policies

174
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
for example uh there will always be

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
maintenance guys coming you have

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
contractors who are coming and going and

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
you'll have policies don't allow them to

178
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
use their laptop for this or that and so

179
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,880
on so these are the protection

180
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
mechanisms that already exist in almost

181
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
all the modern uh critical

182
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
infrastructure what we do on top of this

183
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
we add something called anomaly

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
detectors i think most of you are

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,919
familiar with anomaly detectors and

186
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,560
plant protectors so anomaly detector is

187
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
a technology which is now quite advanced

188
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
and we i would like to say that we are

189
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
some of the first ones who used uh who

190
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,599
created anomaly detectors for critical

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,160
infrastructure using design technology

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
and plant protectors i have not seen

193
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
anywhere else other than in i trust and

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
together these two technologies are we

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
named them as safe crit and this

196
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
technology has been licensed to on a

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
company in atlanta so let us look at the

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
access routes

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
that an attacker can use to launch

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
attack on a critical infrastructure now

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,919
in this diagram of course i have

202
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,400
simplified a critical infrastructure it

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
will have controllers it will have a

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,199
plan network it will have business logic

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,120
and of course the plant business logic

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,880
may or may not be connected to the

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
planned network in any way okay we i'm

208
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
not saying in this diagram it shows that

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
it's connected but it may or may not be

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
connected also some people say that well

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
business logic should never be connected

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,319
some people say hey sometimes it is

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
necessary we need business logic to be

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
connected to the plan so i'm not

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
claiming or saying that it should or

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,919
should not be connected but both

217
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
possibilities exist now through the

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,879
network of course people can come in and

219
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
they can access the plant network via

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
the controller that is one possible

221
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
route they can also come via directly by

222
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
the plant network they could also come

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
via business logic network and probably

224
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
that's how what happened in the colonial

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,199
pipeline and in the worst possible case

226
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,960
they can come directly from controller

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
which is the insider

228
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
attack so these are at least four

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
potential routes to a system that is to

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
be attacked and you might think of some

231
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
other routes also and so on but at least

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,960
these are the four that i think are

233
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,319
pretty much uh

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,599
most pos

235
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,479
most

236
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
prevalent routes to the

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
critical infrastructure

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
now

239
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
as far as the existing solutions are

240
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,559
concerned if you are talking about an

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
attack uh directly from the controller

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,680
which is a scada system or an hmi on the

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
plant then all you have

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
in many systems are firewalls and

245
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,920
network intelligence detection systems

246
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
which could be in the planted between

247
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
the plant network and business logic or

248
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
it could be also outside between the

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,399
business logic and the internet however

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
this uh protection firewalls and etc is

251
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
not going to help in protecting the

252
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
plant again this kind of an attack this

253
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
is the extreme attack that i'm talking

254
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
about where the

255
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
where the adversary has gained control

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
over your uh scada system and now has

257
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
pretty much anything that they can do

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
this is where we come in pretty in a

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
pretty powerful way so there are three

260
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
strategies that we have been deploying

261
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
in order to understand and create some

262
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
of the very powerful technologies uh the

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
one technology is based purely on ai so

264
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
the one of the we have people as you

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
know nowadays all the youngsters who

266
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
come out of graduate college they they

267
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
love ai aiai is a big word and they all

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
want to create technology using ai so we

269
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
do have research that actually takes

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
data from a plant operational plant and

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
creates models of the plant behavior and

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
then these models are used to predict

273
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,399
the plant behavior and that's how the

274
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
anomalies are detected so that is one of

275
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
the ways the other way which we have

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,360
used is combining ai and design and by

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,519
design i mean the plant design that how

278
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,120
the different components of the plant

279
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
are connected with each other which you

280
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
will see in a typical hmi or scada

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,279
screen and plant data and plant design

282
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
are used to decide what models should be

283
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
created and then we that's how we

284
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
created the create the anomaly detector

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
so the key difference between the first

286
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
one ai and ai plus design is in the

287
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
second one the

288
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,600
design of the plant is used to identify

289
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
or to sort of discover what models

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
should be created based on the

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
dependencies of the different components

292
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
in the plant

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
the advantage of this approach is one

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,200
advantage of this approach is that you

295
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
create multiple models not a single

296
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
model so in the first case you might

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
create a single model and a lot of i had

298
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
heard from several professors in

299
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
universities oh give me the data for the

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
plant i have powerful computers and i'll

301
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
create a model and that will work fine

302
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
actually it never works fine it never

303
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
works fine in a large plant if you

304
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,760
create a single model for the plant so

305
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
that's i think most people now realize

306
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,720
that so the with the help of design you

307
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
create multiple models of the plant of

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,120
different portions of the plant and then

309
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,000
use these multiple models to uh

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
find out whether the plant is operating

311
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,079
uh normally or not

312
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,440
but the the the key uh

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
sort of

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
novelty in our strategies is here in

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
design so right from the beginning we we

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
said my university sutd is a design

317
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,760
university singapore university of

318
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,920
technology and design so we said well

319
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,399
okay ai is a big thing no doubt but can

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,880
we use exclusively design in order to

321
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
create anomaly detectors so there was a

322
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
phd on this topic and we found out that

323
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
if you do that the right way okay if you

324
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
do that the right way which means you

325
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
are really clear understand the design

326
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
well and you create your what we call as

327
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
invariants that are essentially rules

328
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
and you deploy them correctly you

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
program them correctly it is almost

330
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,079
impossible for an attacker to launch an

331
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,760
attack on the system that will not be

332
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
detected

333
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,720
so this technology of using purely plant

334
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
design to generate an anomaly detector

335
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
has been our gold standard

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
the issue with this technology has been

337
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
that if you have a large plant that has

338
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
thousands of sensors and

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
pumps etc etc actually creating these

340
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,760
invariants manually is almost impossible

341
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
and therefore what we did was we have

342
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
created now created a tool called aegis

343
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,880
which actually takes the design as input

344
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,680
and generates the anomaly detector as

345
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,399
its output and it is most of the work is

346
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
done automatically

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
which actually reduces the chances of

348
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
error

349
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
in coding and also reduces the chances

350
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
of missing certain relationships across

351
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,000
plants

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
design essentially uses physics and

353
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
chemistry of the plant which where we

354
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
cannot go wrong unless we make an error

355
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,880
in understanding that phase and

356
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
chemistry so the fundamentals of physics

357
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
and chemistry are used in this third

358
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
strategies so these are the three

359
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
strategies that we have used in the past

360
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,040
and evaluated intensively

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,519
so what we do is now the important point

362
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,079
here is i talked about anomaly detection

363
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
now i think all of you will agree with

364
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
me that anomaly detection is essential

365
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
is detecting cyber attack is an

366
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
essential component is a necessary

367
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
component of any defense mechanism you

368
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
must be able to detect however anomaly

369
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,480
detection is not sufficient okay so

370
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
somebody minority detector says this

371
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
pump should be running but it's not

372
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,560
running or this tank is low but the pump

373
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,519
is running okay so what do i do now and

374
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
what why has this happened

375
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,560
so there is a huge amount of work to be

376
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
done once and normally has been detected

377
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
and so anomaly detection necessary but

378
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
not sufficient so what we do is we

379
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
created something called active

380
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,639
protection which actually creates a set

381
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
of tools anomaly detection and

382
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,959
protection they work together and

383
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
therefore we have the necessary and

384
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
sufficiency conditions satisfied it is

385
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,839
still not complete because eventually

386
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
you have to somehow remove the attacker

387
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
from the system because you cannot be

388
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
defending constantly if the attacker is

389
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
there continuously in the system so

390
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
these two the third part that is

391
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,199
removing the attacker is something

392
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,600
different which we haven't worked much

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
on that right now

394
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
then the third important uh thing here

395
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
is

396
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
you know in in when there's a ransomware

397
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,920
attack

398
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,639
one of the key problems that is faced by

399
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,360
the

400
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
cios cisos and the management and the

401
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,519
operators is

402
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
the availability of data

403
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
you lose you may lose chances are you

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,000
will lose your insight into the plant

405
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
so there's a ransomware you know

406
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
sort of a request or not a desire give

407
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,519
me five million dollars and then i

408
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,839
release your plan to you okay but the

409
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
guy doesn't have control over the plant

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
it's not an extreme cyber attack the guy

411
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
only has managed to put

412
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
some sort of a

413
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
page page on your on your screen and you

414
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,040
are scared now but you're not getting

415
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
the data from the plant and people are

416
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
asking you what's happening you said i

417
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,519
don't know what is happening so what

418
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,199
will you do in such a situation in a

419
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
critical infrastructure you shut down

420
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,079
your plant that's what happened in

421
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,440
colonial pipeline they shut down the

422
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
plant and then you know what was the

423
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
consequence so what we have done is we

424
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
have created a separate tunnel so that

425
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
in emergency situations you can continue

426
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,600
to visualize your system data and

427
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,839
performance of course you may ask is

428
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,160
this can this be also attacked so of

429
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
course we try our best to create a

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
completely separate system which is not

431
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
connected to the internet etc etc and

432
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
hopefully that will not be attacked so

433
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
these are the three plant defense

434
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
mechanisms that we have created in eye

435
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
trust and we demonstrate it on our

436
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
systems

437
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
for total plant defense

438
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,240
okay so the issues as i said earlier we

439
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
are talking about ai and design so there

440
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
are some issues with using pure ai

441
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
and one is unwieldy models requiring

442
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
exceptionally large amounts of data and

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
time to train

444
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
so of course one can argue we have

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,920
powerful computers super computers etc

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,680
graphics card and so on so yes that

447
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,399
helps but you still have unwieldy models

448
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,320
and large amount of data then you have

449
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
to a lot of ai goes into feature

450
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
selection so you do feature selection

451
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
okay this plant has thousands of

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
features no no this feature is not that

453
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,279
important this feature is not that

454
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
important so you do a lot of data

455
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
analysis to figure out which features

456
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,040
are important which are not important

457
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
and you ignore the features that are not

458
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,320
important now that is a risky bet

459
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,720
because you may you think those features

460
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
are not important why because they don't

461
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
appear in the data in any significant

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,759
way but actually in a plant they may be

463
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,959
imported

464
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,079
at certain times maybe during safety

465
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
when safety mechanism comes in and so on

466
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,119
so that is a risky thing that ai guys do

467
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,439
then it also lacks in localizing

468
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
anomalies where exactly has the anomaly

469
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,199
occurred so something they normally

470
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,400
might have occurred here the attacker

471
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,199
might have

472
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,679
attacked a valve somewhere but the

473
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
impact is here and the

474
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,599
the detector is showing the impact here

475
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,959
but actually the

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,959
attack was on something else so this is

477
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
another issue with

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,400
pure and ai based then of course one of

479
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,600
the major problems is false positives so

480
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
you keep on tuning your ai system keep

481
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
tuning keep tuning keep tuning until

482
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
your false positive reduces to almost

483
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,919
zero so that's a long process but then

484
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
you have tuned and you said bye bye

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,480
operators now the plant is the anomaly

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
detectors are under you okay the guy

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
goes away and your anomaly detector that

488
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
detector is installed and then suddenly

489
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
there's a change in the plant parameter

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
boom anomalies start coming up so this

491
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
is another issue with and now you say

492
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,320
that okay so what do we do with the

493
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
anomalies you retrain you retrain the

494
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
system again another major uh time time

495
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,200
hogger

496
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
and then of course that's why i said

497
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
frequent relearning may be required and

498
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
hence redeployment due to change in

499
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,799
planned operational mode settings

500
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,559
and finally the failure to detect

501
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
situations where there is no anomalous

502
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,880
network traffic but there exists process

503
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
anomaly so there are several anomaly

504
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,600
detectors that work on network traffic

505
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
it is possible to launch attacks on a

506
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
system where there is no network anomaly

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
absolutely nothing network is fine but

508
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,559
your plant is behaving badly and so if

509
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
your anomaly director is focusing

510
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
exclusively on network traffic sorry it

511
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
is something which is

512
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
existing useful technology but it will

513
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
not detect many attacks which are really

514
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
on the cyst on the plant so what we have

515
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
done is we we use ai and design of

516
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
course we have pure design also but

517
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,799
today i'm only talking about

518
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
ai and design so the advantage is you

519
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
get simple models and the data volume is

520
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
lower for creating each module

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
physics is used to decide which features

522
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
to be selected and not data and exactly

523
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,160
identify and report the compromised

524
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
under the compromised component on the

525
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
set you can do it much better than pure

526
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,799
ai and then the number of false

527
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
positives is near zero and

528
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,160
you have limited retraining and butane

529
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
retuning of course the retraining is

530
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
still required we are still having that

531
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,320
problem of retraining if you use any

532
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
form of ai even if it is with design

533
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
so that is an issue and it is designed

534
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,120
to detect of course ot anomalies so far

535
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,919
we have not focused on network anomalies

536
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,280
right from the beginning we decided that

537
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
we'll focus on ot anomalies because

538
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
there's a huge amount of work already

539
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
and commercial tools available for

540
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,480
detecting network anomalies

541
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,320
now the design-based solution of course

542
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,440
that we have

543
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
pure design-based solution has extremely

544
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
high accuracy

545
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
ultra-low rate of false positives it has

546
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,919
the the manual generation of course as i

547
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,679
said is impractical and therefore it

548
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,600
needs automation which we have almost

549
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
done now

550
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
and so our solution sits like this you

551
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
have the same diagram that i showed you

552
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,240
earlier and safe grit technology

553
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
the beauty of safeguard technology is

554
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
that it can sit anywhere you want

555
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
so we because we have the plant under

556
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
our control we make it sit inside

557
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
controllers on the plant network and

558
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
inside the plant in a real plant

559
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
legacy plant in a real legacy plant the

560
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
plant management may not allow you to do

561
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
this for various reasons and therefore

562
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
your safety

563
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
safety technology might only sit near

564
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
the historian so it may not be any of

565
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
these places it might be outside the

566
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
plant uh next to the historian so that

567
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
is not the best way but that is a

568
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
practical way in legacy plans but our

569
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
technology is actually the best possible

570
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
i would say technology for use when

571
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
you're designing a new plant when you're

572
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
designing a new power network or you're

573
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
designing a new water treatment plant or

574
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,280
whatever

575
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
this technology should be used right at

576
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,919
that time that's why we started by

577
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,679
earlier when we started we said it is

578
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
security by design and many people talk

579
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
about security by design but what does

580
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
that mean and this is what our design

581
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,559
technology meant that is you install it

582
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,480
at the time you're designing the system

583
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,679
not 20 years 10 years later

584
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,159
so just to give summarize this thing we

585
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
do pilots uh we do we do pilots on our

586
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,919
test beds we also do pilots on real

587
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,320
plants so if you see here on the left

588
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,440
side uh on the left most uh

589
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
column here pilot one was done in may

590
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
2020

591
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
using pure ai using pure ai we launched

592
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
48 attacks this was on a real plant i

593
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
cannot disclose what the plant was but

594
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,960
it was a real plant where the water is

595
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,799
actually being consumed by

596
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,240
actual users

597
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,280
we launched 48 attacks and 34 were

598
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,480
detected so the detection rate was 70.83

599
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,200
percent surprisingly over eight hours we

600
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
ran the attacks or the system over eight

601
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
hours four hours on one day four hours

602
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
on the other day in front of plant

603
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
operators and senior management from the

604
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
plant and there were no no false alarms

605
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
zero false alarms over eight hours this

606
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
was a big surprise to the plant

607
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
engineers because they already had

608
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,960
installed technology for anomaly

609
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,559
detection that was generating a lot of

610
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
false alarm so they were quite surprised

611
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
then we did another pilot which is

612
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,080
actually ongoing right now so i don't

613
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
have all the results of that but i'm

614
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,120
only giving you a part of the results

615
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,720
this ongoing pilot is using design and

616
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
ai technology not only i design and ai

617
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,720
we launched 34 attacks and then all 34

618
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,440
were detected we are still saying 99.9

619
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,799
because one of the attacks took quite

620
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
some time to detect and again zero

621
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
percent false alarms

622
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,919
the

623
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,720
the

624
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
we also do exercises so the last column

625
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
the right most column is uh based on the

626
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,919
exercise that we did in 2021 uh which we

627
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,720
do annually uh for the last few years

628
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,679
in this

629
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
attacks were launched by

630
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
people from various parts of the world

631
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
from various militaries located france

632
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,919
germany australia and so on and a total

633
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
of 25 attacks were launched and 23 were

634
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,480
detected so this was 92 detection rate

635
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,120
and again no false alarms and the two

636
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
attacks that were not detected were

637
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
because the guys were smart they

638
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
actually disabled the historian and our

639
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,880
detector was receiving the data from the

640
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
historian it stopped detect receiving

641
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
the data so it could not detect the

642
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
attack so obviously that that tells us

643
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,600
the uh design of or sorry location of

644
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,039
the detectors where should they be

645
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,640
located if you locate them in the

646
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
historian then you may have a problem

647
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,279
but but the attack on the historian was

648
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
detected because we have a blockchain

649
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,960
based technology that detects attacks on

650
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
the historian so the attack on the

651
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
historian was detected but not by this

652
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,159
detector that i'm talking about so that

653
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,600
was quite beautiful essentially we

654
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
detected all the attacks this diagram

655
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
just gives you an idea of the pilots how

656
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,679
we perform the pilot so if you see on

657
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,320
the left most we get the plant data and

658
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,120
we actually put the data diode so that

659
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,279
our technology does not send anything

660
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
back to the plant this is how we

661
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,919
convince our the big plant managers

662
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,799
management that we can do pilots and we

663
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,320
will not

664
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
will not affect your plant so if any one

665
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279
of you here from any country wants us to

666
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,520
do a pilot on your plant this is how we

667
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
will do it and we are right now in the

668
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
process of getting some uh pilots in the

669
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,360
united states some of the water

670
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
treatment plants there

671
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,159
so the one problem we have is of course

672
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
how do we test all this and i told you

673
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,400
how we test it so we have this dad which

674
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
is a pure design based detector we have

675
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
ai kit which is our

676
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
ai and design waste detector and we have

677
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,760
the plant protect mechanism so we put

678
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
this in the plant

679
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
uh but then

680
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
when you do something like this on a

681
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
real plant whether it is our test bed or

682
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
a real plant

683
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
the time to do the experiment and the

684
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
number of experiments you can do is

685
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
limited you cannot run the plant at a

686
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,080
rapid speed the plant water treatment

687
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,600
plant will run at the speed that it is

688
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
running you cannot simply increase the

689
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,159
suddenly the speed of this or the speed

690
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
of the valve to close and open and so on

691
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,240
so therefore what we did was we created

692
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,640
something called a digital twin so for

693
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
the water treatment plant we have a

694
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
digital twin that was also used twice in

695
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
lock shields and we use this digital

696
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,679
twin to conduct our

697
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,679
exercises as well as to

698
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,240
evaluate our technology this has been

699
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,120
very useful because we first

700
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
put our technology into the digital twin

701
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
we connect it to the digital twin it

702
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
gets the data from the twin rather than

703
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
from the actual plant and then you can

704
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
find out how well your technology is

705
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,679
working and you keep on improving it

706
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
once you think hey it's good enough then

707
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
you put it in actual test bed and you

708
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
test it there you improve it and when

709
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
you are pretty sure that hey this

710
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,559
technology is robust powerful then we go

711
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
on the pilot in a real plant so that's

712
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
the strategy we have been using so far

713
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,200
so of course why use the digital twin

714
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
because it enables execution of tasks

715
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
among others that may be too risky to or

716
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
simply infeasible to perform on the twin

717
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,240
plant and that's what so i'll just give

718
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,679
you a brief on

719
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
architecture so swat as i said this is

720
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,039
the our sort test bed for which we have

721
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,720
created the twin which is used in lock

722
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
shields it is a full six stage plant you

723
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
have raw water input at the left then

724
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
the water goes through chemical dosing

725
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
ultra filtration dechlorination reverse

726
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
osmosis and back wash you will find all

727
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
these processes in a large system but

728
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,640
our plant of course is a scaled-down

729
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
version instead of a tank that has a

730
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
hundred million gallons of water we have

731
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
only a few few gallons of water and so

732
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,400
on

733
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
uh this twin that we have is fully

734
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
virtualized which means every plc is in

735
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
a separate vm every rio is in a separate

736
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,440
vm every valve is a separate process

737
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
every pump is a separate process and so

738
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
on so when we actually install this twin

739
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,840
in lock shields we actually install it

740
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,960
as a

741
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,440
distributed system so that the attackers

742
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
can launch attacks and it becomes more

743
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
and more challenging for the uh for the

744
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,840
defenders and of course this is actually

745
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
what happens in a real plant also every

746
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
real plant has an industrial control

747
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
system that is distributed across the

748
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,200
plant through plc's and so on

749
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
uh we have a scada uh to which you can

750
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,559
connect anomaly detectors so

751
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
you can actually

752
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
rent the twin from itrust and you can

753
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
create your own detectors and you can

754
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
hook it to the uh to the to the twin and

755
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
you can test out your own anomaly

756
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
detectors or your own technology so we

757
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,919
so last year uh sorry yeah last year we

758
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
released our twin to our own students

759
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,279
graduate students in su td in singapore

760
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,840
and also to students in bristol and uk

761
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
and i think we have permission to

762
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
actually use this tool for research and

763
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
education so if any one of you is in a

764
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
university or want to do research and

765
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
want to use the twin

766
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,000
you're welcome to contact us

767
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,279
all right this is just a view of our

768
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
scada system for our twin

769
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
surprisingly if i if i say that this is

770
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,600
the scada view of our actual plant i

771
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
will not be wrong because they are

772
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
identical if you see the two plant as

773
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
well as the twin on side by side you

774
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
cannot figure out which one is which

775
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,840
we have a state visualizer which

776
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,679
actually is a very professional looking

777
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,440
system which can actually show you the

778
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,919
actual plots of various uh plant

779
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
components in real time we have an

780
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,919
attack desk this is a beautiful tool

781
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,000
that was developed by one of our interns

782
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,159
so you can use the attack desk to design

783
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,159
attacks in advance these are scripts

784
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,559
small scripts in python you can save

785
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,799
them in a database and you can whenever

786
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
you want you can launch these attacks on

787
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,480
the twin as well as on the real plan so

788
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,200
we use this quite often uh when we do

789
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,960
the demonstration of our

790
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,399
technologies

791
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
thank you very much i'll be happy to

792
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,740
take questions

793
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,880
[Applause]

794
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,799
yes sir

795
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
i've actually done block shields before

796
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,440
and i've seen this in operation it's

797
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
very impressive and you talk about

798
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
building a digital twin like it was

799
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,640
quite straightforward

800
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
but um

801
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
i suspect it was actually quite a

802
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,279
difficult operation can you talk a

803
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,080
little bit more about how you built it

804
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,840
yes

805
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,159
okay so there's a long history and we

806
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,600
have a slide outside which actually

807
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,399
shows you the the details but in brief

808
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,279
uh

809
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,559
the idea of digital twin came to my mind

810
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,440
in around 2017 uh because i was teaching

811
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,799
a class on cyber physical system

812
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,520
security uh with another professor and

813
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,039
every time i would go to the class and i

814
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
would just talk about these plans and

815
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
the students were not able to actually

816
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,279
get their hands on something and so i

817
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,039
started development of the twin in

818
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,559
around 2017

819
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,679
gradually

820
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,039
it was an incremental development

821
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,720
process a very agile process

822
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,000
the gradually developed to a point where

823
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
in 2020 i think we showed it to

824
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
to the ccdcoe folks here and they

825
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,440
thought it was a good thing

826
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,039
then mndf also saw it and they were

827
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,760
pretty happy with it and then after that

828
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,880
at that time we did not have this

829
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
beautiful hmi that you see so one of our

830
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
researchers didn't build this hmi

831
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,840
and so it has grown gradually over

832
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,440
time if you look at the code you will

833
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,240
say this guy is terrible okay so it the

834
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,679
code doesn't look nice to me i'm a

835
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,159
software engineer from by training

836
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
but now we are redoing the twin so that

837
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,159
it looks nice and it is we are actually

838
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,440
creating something called a twin

839
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
generator for which will work for water

840
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
treatment plants so if you have a plant

841
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
which is different from the plant that

842
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,919
we have all you will have to do is to

843
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,720
create two files one file will have the

844
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,279
uh the components the list of components

845
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,440
pumps etc etc the other five will have

846
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
the parameters so this valve for example

847
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,519
takes six seconds to open and close and

848
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
so on these two files are the only files

849
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,159
that you will need and you feed these to

850
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,000
the twin generator and out comes the

851
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
generator not totally correct because

852
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,760
the controller might be different so you

853
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
may have to do some manual work on the

854
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
control logic because the same control

855
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,640
logic might not work

856
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,559
especially for if a plant is different

857
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,080
but most of the

858
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
trend will be generated automatically

859
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
that's what we are doing now but we have

860
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
not completed that work

861
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
yeah

862
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
yes sir

863
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,080
i realized that you soft

864
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
that you soft coded seemingly the

865
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
sensors and the actuators yes

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,360
to your experience in which industries

867
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,080
does this come to a limit uh the

868
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,799
background of my question i've seen the

869
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,880
equivalent now of the

870
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,679
electrical power plant uh installation

871
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,240
and i've talked to their engineers and

872
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,120
they said for certain purposes you

873
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,760
really have to have physical devices

874
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,720
attached could you comment on

875
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,799
that aspect i think that's a very good

876
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,840
point

877
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
so

878
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,320
there are a few uh

879
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,279
few

880
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,200
challenges that we face when we put

881
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
these devices and as you said soft code

882
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
them into the twin

883
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,240
one is if you look at the plots of our

884
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
data

885
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
it looks pretty straight

886
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,200
no noise

887
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
no noise which is not the case in real

888
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
life so motorized valve in real life

889
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
will not always close in exactly six

890
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,120
seconds okay sometimes there'll be some

891
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,519
changes seven seconds and so on

892
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
so in the twin what we have done is we

893
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,159
have added a feature to add noise to the

894
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,960
data so to try to make it realistic i'm

895
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
not saying it is still totally realistic

896
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
but you can control the

897
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
the gaussian noise and its parameters to

898
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
make the noise realistic and then you

899
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
will see the graph which is more like a

900
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,640
real graph in a plant

901
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,799
so that's one one thing we have done uh

902
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,760
the other challenge we face is uh in

903
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,559
faulty creating faulty components so

904
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,720
right now i'm in the process of creating

905
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,399
models because one of our

906
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,720
sponsors they want us to create

907
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
fault models in the twin

908
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,600
so that

909
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
we can simulate so for example the twin

910
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,720
can be run at huge speed you can run the

911
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,640
twin at one second speed or you can run

912
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
it at 100 times the speed so when you do

913
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
that you can run the twin in one day

914
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,919
so that it simulates the plant operation

915
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
over one year

916
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
now during this one year i can i can say

917
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,679
that well

918
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,919
this pump may fail so i can actually

919
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,679
create a model for that pump so that

920
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,840
will fail and that will give you a more

921
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
realistic view into the system so we

922
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
haven't done that and in our code we

923
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
don't yet have the fault models but

924
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
that's what we will plan to do so these

925
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,080
are the two main things i think which

926
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
are

927
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,760
which make our twin sort of not as

928
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,159
realistic as a real plant a real pump

929
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,720
and valve yes so i thank you for that

930
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,440
question very nice

931
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,199
okay any other questions

932
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,199
yes

933
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,280
because i talk to industries i'm working

934
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,000
with critical infrastructures

935
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,040
that have

936
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,879
cyber physical systems which are

937
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,639
completely different from water treating

938
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
plants

939
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
railway systems

940
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,399
uh

941
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,800
if one would put it to the test

942
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,280
uh could you imagine building a model of

943
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
a of a train network with the

944
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,199
controllers

945
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,679
yes i i would say yes and i would say

946
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,560
because

947
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,399
a model of a train network was part of

948
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,119
my ph diseases 50 years ago

949
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,800
but but that was not a twin that was a

950
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
model and there's a difference between a

951
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,359
simulation and a twin uh i mean at one

952
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,520
point they can be together but

953
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
if simulation is detailed

954
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
but the way in which we have built these

955
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,599
twins

956
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,880
i have

957
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,800
started believing that yes you can build

958
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
twins for very complex networks

959
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,359
i would not say that it's an easy thing

960
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,880
to do i think what he was saying was

961
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
right it is not an easy thing to do

962
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,640
the first thing that you need before you

963
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
build the twin is the domain knowledge

964
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,680
you have to be really an expert i was no

965
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,520
expert in water treatment plants but

966
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
because we had the test bed and i was

967
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
going every night i would go to the test

968
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,800
bed it was like almost like my second

969
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,240
partner you know

970
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
so i would go there and look at how it

971
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,680
is functioning look at how the

972
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,599
components are connected and that is

973
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,760
what led us to actually create a twin

974
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
which is quite close to the real

975
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,839
operation so if you ask me to create a

976
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,079
network of twin for a railway network i

977
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,079
would say yes but i will have to

978
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,000
understand or whoever does it has to

979
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,160
understand so that domain knowledge is

980
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
absolutely critical

981
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
but the answer to your question is yes

982
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,079
you can create twins for large-scale

983
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,000
complex systems or cyber physical

984
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,839
systems yes

985
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,599
and they help they would be very helpful

986
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,000
for research and education for training

987
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,240
also

988
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,279
all right thank you very much thanks

989
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,479
[Applause]

990
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,200
sorry i was just here and uh i'm gabor

defense center of excellence

993
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,520
and uh i've been dealing with industrial

994
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,240
control systems in the last few years

995
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,040
and i just want to emphasize the the

996
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,599
role of i trust how they helped or work

997
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
in research and exercises and i would

998
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,040
like to say thanks for you to being here

cooperation between the

1002
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,440
between the partners like ccdc and

1003
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,320
itrust so thank you and i hope that you

1004
