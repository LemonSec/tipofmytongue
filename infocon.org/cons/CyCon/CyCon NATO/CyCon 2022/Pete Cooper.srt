1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
morning everyone uh

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,080
thank you very much to uh this team at

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,359
ccdcoe um thank you very much for yak

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
for his leadership um over

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,679
uh many years

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
um it's great to be here in in talon and

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
actually sort of getting out and meeting

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,439
new people and engaging on such

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,039
fantastic topics

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
um one of the great things about

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
traveling again is that you

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,760
get to learn and understand and uh and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
speak to people it was great last night

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,679
to see the walking tour of such a

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,200
fantastic city

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,480
um

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
and learning that that in estonian you

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,239
don't really say everything is good you

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,879
you say everything is normal

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
so i think on behalf of cyber security

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,399
um

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
people across the entire world i think

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,200
we can all say that we're looking

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
forward to another completely normal

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,480
year

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
but i think that we can safely say that

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,120
with the current events around the world

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,239
and what we've seen over the last couple

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,960
of years that's pretty much unlikely to

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,920
happen

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
we've got a hot war where we can see an

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
adversary who

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
has has no compunction for

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
understanding or holding lines or

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
attacking

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
anything in the digital physical space

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
and we've seen vulnerabilities impact us

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
globally that have had significant

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,080
impacts

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,479
on all of our systems

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,200
and it's against that backdrop that

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
over the last couple of years in the uk

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
we've really been taking a good hard

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,079
look at how is it that we transform and

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,600
defend

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
the cyber security of of government as a

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
sector

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
and how do we actually make a huge

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
difference in the long term

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,119
to actually making resilient and secure

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,600
public services all the way from

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
uh the smaller systems in in some of the

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
departments and organizations all the

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,040
way up to the national security

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
apparatus

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
and we've started landing upon some of

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
those key key topics which is really

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
boiling down to what we think good looks

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
like

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
and a lot of that actually has a lot of

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
comparison with what you can see across

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
nato and other countries

63
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,920
and that's what i'd like to talk about

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
today

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
and if we sort of start looking back to

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
how we've all thought about cyber

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,440
conflict and defending ourselves

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
when i started sort of years ago back in

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,599
the military i was always thinking about

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,879
well actually

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
conflict is is a very physical it's a

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,720
very visceral thing

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,319
and then with the emergence of the cyber

74
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
domain then we all started thinking well

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,599
it's actually the person at the back

76
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,400
it's the

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
it's the network defender that's going

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
to make a massive difference but

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
everything we're seeing and and just

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
from the sort of like the great talk

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
there from nathaniel as well is that

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
this is now a blended thing

83
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
and and recent events really have

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
underscored that where we're seeing that

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,239
actually this isn't one or the other

86
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
it's actually both and it's how we work

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
together which is critical to this

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
and it's not those two actors it's also

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
the mix and blend across public and

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
private sector

91
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
it's the mix between ngos and it's how

92
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
we work together

93
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
to secure what it is that we are trying

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
to achieve

95
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
and from the uk perspective

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
we had to sort of really take a good

97
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
look at ourselves and actually try to

98
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
work out what are our challenges what is

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
it that we're really trying to to fix

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
here

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
and if you look across something the

102
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680
size and scale of of a of a government

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
and public sector

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
at a national level

105
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
you'll see that the common challenges

106
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
across many organizations including the

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
private sector is that there's lots and

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
lots of great work

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,080
but is it really joined up or is it

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
slightly siloed

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
how do we get people to the point where

112
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
actually they are actually working

113
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,799
together

114
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
and actually it's combined and a joint

115
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
effort

116
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
and we had to actually look at our

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,319
standards

118
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
we had a one-size-fits-all standard

119
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
so uh have you got this in place yes

120
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,640
fantastic

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,159
is that really a case that is

122
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,000
valid for going forwards

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
and also as well as are we actually

124
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,159
checking it and assuring that at scale

125
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
and that's a huge huge challenge

126
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
we had massively different capabilities

127
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,839
across the whole of the estate um

128
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,279
that were making it really difficult to

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
actually combine

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
efforts and join people up

131
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
and again when you're looking at

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
large-scale long-term change how do you

133
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
measure progress over time and this is a

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
huge challenge for lots of organizations

135
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,360
be they

136
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
in any sector

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
and it's really important to understand

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
the context of what it is you're trying

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
to achieve

140
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
you can't just develop a strategy you

141
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,280
can't just develop a policy or a new

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
standard in isolation

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
you have to work out the context upon

144
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
which you're developing it so in the in

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
the uk we have the the integrated review

146
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
where it talks about it's not possible

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,199
to

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
predict or prevent every single risk

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,800
so actually how do we improve our own

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
ability to anticipate prevent prepare

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
and respond to and recover from those

152
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
realized risks

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
and we drew that down into the national

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,919
strategy as well where we talk about the

155
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
resilience and defending all of our

156
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,039
systems and promoting the capabilities

157
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,960
internally of the uk

158
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
of making a difference across the cyber

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
domain

160
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
and we had to pull the thread through

161
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,919
through that international international

162
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,600
integrated review context all the way

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
through the national strategy into the

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
government cyber security strategy

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
because when it when you look at the

166
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
long-term change you're really trying to

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
help your

168
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
um workers your um personnel understand

169
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
how they sit in the bigger picture

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,720
they need to be able to pull the thread

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
from where they are all the way up

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
through the organization to the

173
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,400
objectives of the organization

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
because we need to keep that alignment

175
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
and keep that vision

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
going all the way forwards

177
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
because this is a really complex area

178
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
and there's a fantastic quote by frank

179
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
herbert in june which talks about he or

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,039
he who can destroy a thing controls a

181
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,160
thing

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
because this isn't just about securing

183
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
data or services this is about securing

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
trust

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
and i think we tend to get slightly lost

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
in the technology now and again

187
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,240
and actually we've got to sort of list

188
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
lift our heads and lift our eyes to

189
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,319
actually some of the key challenge

190
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
because across your customers your

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
clients your citizens

192
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,000
they need to be able to trust what it is

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
that we are doing

194
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,319
they need to be able to trust and

195
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,520
understand

196
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
that actually

197
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,319
we are going to secure

198
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,639
that trust all the way through

199
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,960
because we can't let our adversaries

200
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
destroy weaken or control it

201
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
it's not just about the technology

202
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
and the other the other key thing that

203
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
people always look at is

204
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
from a government perspective

205
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,000
then it's

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
really easy to

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
sort of start driving change from the

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
center

209
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
and actually when you're sitting there

210
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
going right we we need to actually

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
improve things

212
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,960
i love xkcd for uh for how standards

213
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
proliferate when people say right we

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
have to actually improve we need to go

215
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,720
here 14 standards before long you have

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
15 standards and everyone starts getting

217
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
even more confused

218
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,840
so when we start looking at how do we

219
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,359
drive and enable change

220
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,560
it's

221
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
the approach that we took

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
was a lot more of the build and they

223
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
will come rather than here is a new

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,840
standard that we all have to follow

225
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,039
because when you're looking at

226
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,280
large-scale change if you can sell the

227
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,759
vision to people if you can sell the the

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,919
actual long-term goal of how this is

229
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,280
going to help them

230
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,479
how this is going to help their

231
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,720
organizations then they're more likely

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
to come on that journey with you

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
and that's a much much more engaged

234
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,840
method than just imposing a new standard

235
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,960
um it's more of a carrot approach

236
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
there is always a balance to be had

237
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
though because you need to have actually

238
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
those clear guide the clear guidance

239
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
and the challenge to be able to say to

240
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,319
people this is how we're going forward

241
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,919
so all the way through the development

242
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,280
of the strategy

243
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
we also had an external challenge panel

244
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
who for when we as as government was

245
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
sitting down saying right actually what

246
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
are ideas how can we take this forward

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,759
we have an external challenge panel made

248
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,800
up of industry academia and and um

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,960
individuals from the think tank world

250
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,319
that we could actually challenge us and

251
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
how we were thinking

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
because we don't want to end up in a

253
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
place where we're adding complexity to

254
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
our challenge which is already complex

255
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,719
and where we ended up um with the

256
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,719
government's cyber security strategy

257
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,000
is is

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
what we think is really

259
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
fairly sort of simple and boiled down of

260
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
of to some of those key challenges

261
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
the vision really speaks to that top

262
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
level integrated review down through the

263
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
national strategy into the cyber

264
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
strategy

265
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,680
it's focused on the delivery of public

266
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
services it's focused on

267
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
securing all of those services through

268
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,959
national security and then strengthening

269
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,800
the uk as a sovereign nation and

270
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
cementing our um

271
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
position as a democratic and responsible

272
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
cyber power

273
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
that's our sort of capstone

274
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
and then how do we draw that down into

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
the aim for the strategy itself

276
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
and this is where it can be really easy

277
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
to try and boil the ocean of what you're

278
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,080
trying to achieve on

279
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
on a name such as this

280
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
but really when it comes down to it

281
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
you're trying to be resilient against

282
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
known bad

283
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
it can be too easy to turn around to

284
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
your teams and say be ready for anything

285
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
define anything

286
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,839
so what we really focused on is is the

287
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,279
known bad

288
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,680
so we want to make sure that

289
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,839
at scale we can be resilient against

290
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
known vulnerabilities known attack

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
methods

292
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
because we can teach our teams on that

293
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
we can build our processes we can build

294
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
our people based on

295
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,839
actually managing the threats and

296
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,120
vulnerabilities that are out there that

297
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
we know about now

298
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,240
and and you might be thinking well

299
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
actually how how does that help you on

300
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,079
the new stuff that lands

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,440
if you can manage all of those

302
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
vulnerabilities and all of those threats

303
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
quickly and at pace

304
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,360
then actually your teams your people and

305
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
your processes will get you the rest of

306
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
the way

307
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
and it gives you a lot of structure and

308
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,839
it gives you a lot of um

309
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
timelines and metrics to be able to take

310
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
that forwards

311
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,399
the other challenges that we had as we

312
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
were going uh through the strategy is

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
that actually

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
when people talk about right we need to

315
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
make change and drive change quickly

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,079
when we've proposed a timeline of out to

317
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,079
2030 so about eight years from now

318
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
people say well we must be able to do

319
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
this quicker

320
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
but when you're looking at large-scale

321
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
long-term change

322
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
and this and the scale of the challenge

323
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
we're not just looking at technological

324
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
change we're actually looking at

325
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,839
cultural change how do we how do we

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,279
think about this problem and how do we

327
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
develop our thinking to a place where

328
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,399
actually

329
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,079
we've built the people the technology

330
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,399
and the processes at scale across lots

331
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
and lots of different organizations that

332
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
are currently quite different in their

333
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
approaches

334
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
this is all about developing that fixed

335
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
point on the horizon

336
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,959
because now and again in the cyber

337
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,480
security domain

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,000
with the technological challenges we're

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
facing it sometimes feels like we're

340
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
running whilst we're looking at our feet

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,800
if we're looking at this through a

342
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
long-term change perspective we need

343
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,399
that fixed point on the horizon that

344
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,640
people can look at and people can work

345
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
towards throughout leadership will

346
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,000
change

347
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
organizations will change it's

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
maintaining the fixed point on the

349
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
horizon that everyone knows how to get

350
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
to

351
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,519
and then how it all fits together

352
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,480
we did keep it really simple

353
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
and when it boils down to it

354
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,680
this is fully about having resilient

355
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,600
organizations so that first pillar of

356
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
build organizational cyber security

357
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
resilience

358
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
is the foundation of all of this

359
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
all of the great conversations we've

360
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
seen over the last day

361
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
keep talking about the importance of

362
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
resilience

363
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
and when we thought about actually

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
the adversaries that we've got

365
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
we know that at some point we will have

366
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
some strategic surprise we know at some

367
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
point organizations will have issues so

368
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
this is about making sure that we have

369
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,839
resilience throughout um

370
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,079
the the entire estate

371
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,519
and i'll talk about the defenders one

372
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
piece in a second

373
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
but we broke this down to we need

374
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,360
organizations to be able to manage their

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
security risk

376
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,079
and what does that look like it's

377
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,760
actually having the governance and the

378
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,920
leadership in place and understanding

379
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,959
what it is that they're actually

380
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
defending

381
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
being able to protect against cyber

382
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
attack

383
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,680
actually having

384
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,760
the elements in place be able to

385
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
understand not just where their assets

386
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
are but actually be able to protect

387
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,320
those assets and protect those systems

388
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,519
the third

389
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,880
reads to

390
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
how do we detect not just within the

391
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
organizations but also at scale

392
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,320
and that sometimes if you look at the

393
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
complexity of systems across something

394
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
as large and complex as for example

395
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
government or a public sector or any

396
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
sector that's actually really difficult

397
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
to achieve

398
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,120
and objective four talks about when this

399
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
goes wrong and actually attacks do

400
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
happen how do we minimize the impact of

401
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
all of those events

402
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
underpinned

403
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,279
on all of this

404
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,279
is skills knowledge and culture

405
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
that's as simple as we could boil down

406
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,639
this challenge

407
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,720
because for long-term change that's the

408
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
critical piece

409
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
and against all of those things we can

410
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
pull the thread from each one of those

411
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,839
activities all the way up through the

412
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,279
strategy all the way up through

413
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
integrated review

414
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
so for a team for an individual on the

415
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
ground they can completely situate

416
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
themselves in what it is they're doing

417
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,680
every single day

418
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
and if you also look at that

419
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
effort

420
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,279
this isn't just about

421
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,160
how does an organization achieve this

422
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
but it's how do we achieve this at scale

423
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
which comes back to the defenders one

424
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
piece

425
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
when we talk about detect we're not just

426
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
talking about can an organization detect

427
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,440
if there's

428
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
an adversary on their network but how do

429
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600
we detect at scale

430
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
how do we get the the combination of all

431
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,440
of those organizations working together

432
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
so we can actually collaborate a lot

433
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
more

434
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,079
and some of the some of those sort of

435
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
personal reflections on the journey

436
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,519
is

437
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,680
it's a real balance between scale and

438
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,959
time scale

439
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,639
smaller organizations can move in a

440
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
really quite agile manner in this

441
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,320
but how do we do that with multiple sort

442
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
of hundreds and thousands potentially of

443
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
organizations

444
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
because it can be really lost to get

445
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
cyber that is get lost in that noise

446
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,120
when this is just about getting the

447
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
foundation and bring clarity to what it

448
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
is that we're trying to manage

449
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
and that's a really hard question

450
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
sometimes for large and complex

451
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
organizations

452
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
the simple question of who is

453
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
responsible

454
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
can be really hard

455
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,639
at sector scale because that's the

456
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
challenge that we're facing

457
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
it's not just organization it's not just

458
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,959
sectoral but it's also national and then

459
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
international as well because we're all

460
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
partners with each other it's

461
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
understanding those overlaps

462
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,480
it's understanding where the venn

463
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
diagram point touches everybody and what

464
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
we can all commonly agree on that's

465
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,519
critical

466
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,279
and then when we really start focusing

467
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,320
on that resilience and that

468
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
understanding

469
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,199
then it means that we get to the point

470
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
where we can make cyber security

471
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
resilience a really good and fantastic

472
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
critical enabler of that strategic and

473
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
operational freedom of movement

474
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
and it's engaging everybody from the

475
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,079
technical

476
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
operators all the way up to the senior

477
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,399
leadership

478
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
and it's also worthwhile touching now on

479
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,079
this on the supply chain challenge

480
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,680
it's been one of those key topics that

481
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,199
we all talk about

482
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,639
and have been talking about sort of

483
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,320
increasingly with some of the incidents

484
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
that that we've all seen

485
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
and and the orborus has a meaning of

486
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
circular infinity

487
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
because we've got to remember that the

488
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
supply chain challenge is is not a

489
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,399
one-way flow down

490
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
we are all because of the

491
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
interconnectedness of the domain in some

492
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
way we are all both suppliers and

493
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
customers

494
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
if not in a commercial way but also in a

495
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
data sense

496
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
if you look at a government if you look

497
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,920
at a

498
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,839
national systems

499
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,279
in some way

500
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
there is an interconnectedness

501
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
there is nothing that is really

502
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
happening in isolation from everybody

503
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
so how we go forwards in tackling the

504
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
supply chain is really collectively

505
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
this is a public private partnership

506
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
really in this in its truest sense

507
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,399
across all of us

508
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
and also as well when we're talking

509
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,199
about

510
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
resilience and it's already been touched

511
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
upon in previous conversations

512
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,039
is we have to be able to learn from

513
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
others as previously mentioned this

514
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
morning is is learning from other

515
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,199
sectors

516
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
and actually there's a huge amount of

517
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
value in trying to learn from other

518
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
sectors

519
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,799
because

520
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,079
they've already gone through this

521
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,760
learning journey

522
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
how do we

523
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
take their learning journey and actually

524
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
apply it to ourselves

525
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,039
and key to that is

526
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
for me

527
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
the challenge we've seen around data and

528
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
it's making the most of the data that

529
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
we've got out there

530
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
it's easy to drown in data in a way but

531
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,240
actually what we've really seen is how

532
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,960
do you how do you learn once and do many

533
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
times

534
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
so we've got lots of

535
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,000
fantastic capabilities across the whole

536
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of the estate but how do we get that

537
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
data shared around the estate

538
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,679
so that we learn every single time

539
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,280
it's not enough

540
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
to learn from an incident how do we

541
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,559
learn from all of the events that are

542
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,840
slightly below that water line and we

543
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
actually avoid incidents before they

544
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
become accidents

545
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
and that's where for example we've got

546
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
lessons from

547
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
the counter-terrorism world

548
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,640
so if somewhere within your nation

549
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
there was information that could have

550
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,640
potentially prevented a terrorist attack

551
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
the subsequent investigation will say

552
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
that information should have been with

553
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
the right person at the right time in

554
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
order to disrupt it and stop it

555
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,080
in the cyber security world it's the

556
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
same

557
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
if somewhere within your organizations

558
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,200
there was an information that could have

559
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
stopped an attack

560
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,720
is it with that person is it in an

561
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
actionable format can they do something

562
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,679
about it and can they stop that attack

563
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,679
so this this is really now starting to

564
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
get to the

565
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
we can't try to defend in our stove

566
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
pipes

567
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
we can't actually allow organizations to

568
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,559
try and be resilient by themselves this

569
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
is how do we learn together and it's

570
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
starting to break down these barriers so

571
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,880
that is

572
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
more of a collective defense which then

573
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
goes to some of the fantastic efforts of

574
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
nato over the years

575
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,320
and then if you look at something like

576
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
the aviation sector in the aviation

577
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
sector

578
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,559
there's an analogy of

579
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,760
they never want to suffer the same

580
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
accident twice

581
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
how do we learn at every single stage

582
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
how do we get our organization how do we

583
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,120
get our individuals to really take the

584
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
the the act the accidents the incidents

585
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
the near misses

586
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
and share them and discuss them and chat

587
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
through them

588
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,039
and learn from them so it doesn't happen

589
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,919
again and again that value and that

590
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,240
approach and that culture is something

591
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
that we found really really useful when

592
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,520
it comes to cyber security

593
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
because this really really boils down to

594
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
the people

595
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,280
so

596
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
finding and hiring with diversity is

597
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,600
absolutely critical to this

598
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
and that's not just in the the

599
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
conversations around trying to increase

600
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
the gender balance across the the cyber

601
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
security world but also of the skills

602
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,039
that people have got there

603
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
everything we've seen through through

604
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,320
the efforts that we've been getting

605
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
engaged in is this challenge that we're

606
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
trying to tackle

607
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
it goes right from the technical

608
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,960
leadership

609
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
and the and the

610
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
the the analysts all the way up to the

611
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,679
senior leadership within the

612
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,960
organization

613
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
and so how do we actually train

614
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
and educate

615
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
and actually advise all the way through

616
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
that entire spectrum

617
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,600
because when we go back to that

618
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
defenders one mindset this isn't just

619
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
across organizations but within

620
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
organizations is everybody in that

621
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
organization really thinking about how

622
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
they defend it and look after it

623
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
and everything that we've seen and

624
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
discussed and it's a an ongoing

625
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,799
challenge around the world is

626
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,520
the rate and scale and increase of our

627
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
cyber security challenges

628
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
feels like we're never going to quite

629
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
have enough people to achieve to

630
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
actually tackle them

631
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,760
and if we start thinking about well if

632
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,799
we're not going to have enough people

633
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,280
what does that do to our mindset

634
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
what can we do to actually make our life

635
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
easier to make the life easier for the

636
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
teams on the ground for the individuals

637
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
that are trying to make a difference

638
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,960
how do we simplify their processes it's

639
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
already been touched upon about how do

640
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
we automate and

641
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
actually

642
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,840
make the signal from noise a lot easier

643
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
and also we've got to empower them and

644
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
we've got to help them be creative

645
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,600
because

646
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
our adversaries are innovating all of

647
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,720
the time and nathaniel actually touched

648
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,039
upon that this morning their pace of um

649
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400
innovation is significant

650
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
rigid structures rigid processes and

651
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
actually help is not going to help us

652
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,159
going forwards so how do we get our

653
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,919
individuals to the point where actually

654
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,520
they really can

655
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,039
um turn around and start giving out

656
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
those those fantastic and new ideas

657
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
and shifting this perception

658
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,280
away from the human being being the

659
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
weakest link to the human being being

660
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
the strongest link in our organizations

661
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
this is not just about the technology

662
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
because this is about culture

663
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,679
it's the only thing that increases in

664
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,559
value over time

665
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,960
so having had a look at the resilience

666
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
and trying to improve look at how we

667
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,919
improve resilience across the uk

668
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
the next question is how do we know that

669
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,039
it's improving

670
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,320
and actually

671
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
how do we actually get to the point

672
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
where we've got proportionate realistic

673
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,880
metrics that it's improving at scale

674
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
and the way that we're looking to do

675
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
this is is something that we we're

676
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
calling sort of govershaw so this is

677
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
really this this single view of

678
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,720
understanding risk at scale

679
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
and it's moving it to the point where

680
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,919
it's tailored to threats

681
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,360
simplified

682
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
and it's and critically to this it's

683
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,480
objective

684
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,919
and it's also creating a natural

685
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
feedback loop again trying to reduce the

686
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,480
burden for the teams on the ground

687
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,840
and if we think about the pillars of

688
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,679
what we're doing on the strategy of

689
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,240
manage protect detect and minimize

690
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,679
that's how we're going to be assessing

691
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,000
the teams and the organizations out

692
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,039
there

693
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,640
and as we measure them we're actually

694
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
doing it against

695
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
a standardized framework that's already

696
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
in existence so it's not creating

697
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
anything new um

698
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,600
and we create this feedback loop because

699
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
we're assessing them against the pillars

700
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
that are already in the strategy so as

701
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,520
time goes on then actually we just get a

702
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
steady feedback loop of whether we are

703
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
actually making a difference or not

704
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,120
so it's about

705
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
getting that um

706
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
steady and under a steady build of

707
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
understanding across the whole of the

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
estate

709
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
and it's helping the organizations walk

710
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,000
through this process to better

711
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
understand themselves

712
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
but again as we do this

713
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
this is not just about the organizations

714
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
this is about sector and national scale

715
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
so as they prioritize and they go

716
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,000
through themselves at their own

717
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
self-assessments

718
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
we've got objectivity we've got order in

719
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,120
there and then a final assessment

720
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
the value of a single organization going

721
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
through that for them is fantastic

722
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
the value of all your organizations

723
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,799
going through that and then getting this

724
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,279
sectoral vision and the sectoral view of

725
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,480
where you are

726
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,080
is the thing that makes a huge huge

727
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
difference for long-term planning for

728
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,840
long-term understanding of where your

729
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
gaps are where your common challenges

730
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,799
are

731
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
because it's the common challenges that

732
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,039
have to be fixed at scale in working

733
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
together

734
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,000
and we also

735
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,240
really really focused on how do we look

736
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,159
at minimizing the impact of security

737
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
incidents

738
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,840
within your organizations we talk about

739
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
uh the standard sort of prepare respond

740
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
recover and learn cycle

741
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but how do you do that on national scale

742
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,559
how do you do a sectoral scale

743
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,840
because the challenge is slightly

744
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,919
different

745
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,640
so

746
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,080
the way that we're starting to approach

747
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
this is

748
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,400
typically you would look at doing a red

749
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
team exercise on an organization

750
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,760
which really digs into

751
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
threat lead let's test the technology

752
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,279
let's test whether the controls are

753
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,840
working against this organization

754
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
but if you think about the reports that

755
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
generally come out of things like that

756
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
they're quite technical

757
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
are they engaged with

758
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
the senior leadership does it really

759
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,559
relate to what the impact of that

760
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,440
outcome or those outcomes could be

761
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,039
so we're getting to a point now where

762
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,400
actually

763
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,480
we'll do a red team excise we'll do a

764
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
threat led penetration test

765
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
but then we're looking to flip the

766
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
results of those exercises

767
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
into

768
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
of the technical exercises into a

769
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
tabletop exercise that involves senior

770
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,159
leadership

771
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
so the senior leadership then walk

772
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,760
through and live the experience of what

773
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,720
we've just found technically

774
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
they can contextualize those technical

775
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,919
results

776
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
into what it means for them as leaders

777
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,320
of that organization

778
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,919
so by the time we come off the

779
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,919
engagement then actually we're at a

780
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,919
point now where technical teams have the

781
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,520
same visibility and same understanding

782
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,400
as the leadership teams

783
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
and we can start doing that at multiple

784
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,279
scales

785
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
and this really now does start getting

786
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,159
us into

787
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,559
defending as one because our attackers

788
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,720
do not attack in stove pipes we can't

789
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,799
defend in stove pipes

790
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
so within and across organizations i

791
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,640
mean the diagram here from xkcd

792
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,559
was designed to talk about software

793
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,320
supply chain challenges

794
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
in reality this is what all of our

795
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
sectors and large-scale organizations

796
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,360
look like with our teams

797
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,200
we can't have people thinking in their

798
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,799
blocks we have to actually get people

799
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,400
working together because then we'd get a

800
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,640
signal from noise at scale and a

801
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
defensive force that is greater than the

802
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,400
sum of the individual parts

803
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
and we're trying to take that forward by

804
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
creating a subsecurity coordination

805
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,960
center that looks after us as a sector

806
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,880
that can start coordinating across all

807
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
of those different bits so we can do

808
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,840
this at scale and pace

809
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
because across the technology that we

810
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,039
have

811
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,880
the vulnerabilities we have are

812
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
significant

813
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
we will always have the challenge of

814
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
vulnerabilities out there

815
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,080
but it's not just your organization

816
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,520
so whenever we get a vulnerability or a

817
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
large scale vulnerability

818
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
all of your organizations could have the

819
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,440
same challenge so if we really want to

820
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,679
start defending as one we need to start

821
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,120
talking together

822
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
we need to start engaging across all of

823
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
those organizations to see who's found a

824
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,559
really good way to mitigate it and move

825
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,480
on quickly

826
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
because this is about doing this at

827
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,520
scale and building that trust and

828
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
engagement

829
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,039
and it's not just looking within your

830
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,120
own organizations we've already touched

831
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
upon the value of working across

832
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,120
industry and government

833
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,880
but the hacker and research community

834
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
are fantastic at doing this sort of

835
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,120
thing

836
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
and that's why building trust across all

837
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,760
of those different partnerships and

838
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,799
relationships is really really critical

839
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,919
and it's the same when it comes to

840
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,240
threats how many threat actors will only

841
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,919
attack one organization within your

842
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,000
sector

843
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
really threat actors will go against

844
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
multiple organizations within your

845
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,200
sector how do you actually get your

846
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,039
organizations talking

847
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
so that you can engage find and actually

848
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
get that signal from noise again

849
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,399
and then this brings us across in a full

850
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,039
circle through to deterrence

851
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,039
i mean fantastic presentations yesterday

852
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,840
talking about the challenges of

853
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,520
deterrence whereas if we can really boil

854
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,200
this challenge down

855
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
of what it is we're trying to achieve at

856
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
government and national level and also

857
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
in private sector

858
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,279
if we really focus on the resilience if

859
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
we really focus on being able to defend

860
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,440
as one we get to the point where we get

861
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,039
to potentially deterrence through

862
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
defensive denial

863
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,279
we get the point where an adversary has

864
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,799
so much effort that they need to try and

865
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,799
expend

866
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
that there is no such thing really as a

867
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,880
campaign there's an

868
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
attempt an achievement of an effect we

869
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,799
all talk we all mitigate and we will

870
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,640
move forward

871
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
it's about increasing risks and costs

872
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,840
all the way through

873
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
and reducing their ability for strategic

874
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
surprise

875
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
because fundamentally with the

876
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
interconnectedness of the domain

877
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,720
we are in this together and we can act

878
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
together

879
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,080
so

880
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,679
it's been a fantastic journey over the

881
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,880
last couple of years to try and

882
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,159
transform how we think nationally around

883
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,559
cyber security and cyber defense

884
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,399
boiling it down to that

885
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
focus on resilience boiling it down to

886
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
that focus on how do we defend as one

887
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,919
how do we defend across all of those

888
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,000
organizations how do we share data and

889
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
how do we get ahead of the adversary

890
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,159
and that has so much applicability

891
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
across national international and

892
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,640
coalition as well and we can make a

893
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
difference

894
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,930
so um thank you very much

895
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:46,709
[Applause]
