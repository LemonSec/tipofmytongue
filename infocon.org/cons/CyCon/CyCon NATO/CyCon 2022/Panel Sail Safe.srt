00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
focus on the cyber security of

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,000
ships modern ships i'm a phd student at

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
tall tech regarding cycon i'm the

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
co-chair of the conference and the

manager of technology track

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
today i'm going to moderate this panel

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,119
in which with or distinguished speakers

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,399
we will focus on cyber security in

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
maritime

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,239
noida is the importance of the shipping

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,719
industry for modern society is

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
constantly growing

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,280
more than 90 percent of the goods across

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
the world are being transported by the

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,719
sea

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,760
the need

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,239
to reduce the operational costs and the

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,280
delivery times has led the industry to

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
seeking technological technological

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,719
solutions

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
along with the growing reliance on

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,199
automation

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,319
the risk of external interference and

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,320
disruption of key systems is greatly

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,600
increased

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
malicious actors can interfere interfere

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
with different control systems of the

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,759
ship

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
and can cut off external communication

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
or obtain confidential data

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,960
western cyber security is recently

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
gaining momentum

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
as a result of fair of few

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
recent attacks

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
to western sc but i'm sure there is a

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
lot more to know

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
in our panel today or first speaker

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
professor katsikas

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,119
will introduce the actual situation and

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
the cyber challenges in the maritime

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,320
sector

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
then we will dig deeper

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,119
dr michael thomas will share

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,880
his uh results in his research and

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
discuss the land-based attack scenarios

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
and possible consequences against ships

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840

will offer us possible mitigation for

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
cyber threats in a maritime sector

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360

shall we

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,720
start the the slides

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
okay good

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
so uh

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
that's just the the first one and

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
it's supposed to serve as an

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
introduction to the discussion that we

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
will have uh uh later with uh with

99
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,640
michael and uh isidoros hopefully so

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,358
just to start with a few words about the

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,959
norwegian center for cyber security and

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
critical sectors which i'm the director

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,639
of

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,320
it's a

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
research-based innovation center

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
which is actually a public-private

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
partnership between

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
research

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,199
institutions and universities in norway

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,080
and several industries in different

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
sectors critical sectors all of them

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
actually are critical infrastructures

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
even though we call them we call them

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
critical sectors

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,080
and the the idea

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
uh behind its development is that we

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
create a bridge between our research

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
groups in cyber security that exists in

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
ntnu and in our research partners and

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
what i call the the real world

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
of industry on the other side of course

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
to non-norwegians these

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
logos may not mean much

124
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
but those that can identify

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
loggers will see that these are partners

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
from the process industry the defense

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
industry the

128
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
power industry the oil and gas industry

129
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
healthcare and the police and so on as

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,639
well as the security industry and then

131
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
there are a number of international

132
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,479
collaborators around the world

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,440
from

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,720
asia europe uh and north america

135
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
collaborating with us we started about

136
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
almost two years ago

137
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
and the lifetime of the center is

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
supposed to be

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
eight years after that it's supposed to

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,759
be self-sustainable

141
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,960
so

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
one of the the sectors that we do

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
research in and remember it's a

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
research-based innovation center so it's

145
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,199
applied research

146
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
uh is of course the the time maritime

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
sector even though this is not

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
represented among our industry partners

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,199
so

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
there is a lot of

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
research going on and

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,919
you might wonder why all this fuss about

153
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,080
cyber security in the in the maritime

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
sector uh lately well

155
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
unfortunately we may like it or not but

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,400
usually it's money behind everything i

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
hate to say that but as an academic but

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
unfortunately this is this is the way it

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
usually is

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
so uh just as an example gabriel already

161
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,759
gave you an indication that 90 of the

162
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,520
goods worldwide are transported by ship

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
right i hope that i was true yeah yeah

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,240
absolutely yeah and of course this gives

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,479
you an indication of the magnitude the

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
economic magnitude of the industry so

167
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
this is just you know a small portion of

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
that

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
in in europe and i would just draw your

170
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
attention to the fact that the overall

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
contribution of the shipping industry

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
not the maritime the the shipping alone

173
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,360
uh to the european gdp is

174
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,840
149 i think a billion

175
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
euros

176
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
i if i'm not mistaken the european gdp

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
is something around 17

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,919
trillion

179
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
so you can do the math and say that this

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,039
is a substantial percentage actually of

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,360
the overall european gdp

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
so this is one of the reasons why

183
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
interest in the cyber security of the

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
the shipping industry has grown

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
lately and by lately

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,199
i mean

187
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
almost 10 years really

188
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
the one of the first reports if not the

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
first report that i came across

190
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
regarding the security of the

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
maritime sector came from media those of

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
you not familiar with anisa it's the

193
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,080
european network and information

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,360
security agency that's the european uh

195
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
european union

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,879
agency

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
mandated with supporting cybersecurity

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
activities in

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
member states so they came up with this

200
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
report back in november 2011

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
and the

202
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
summary or the conclusions of the report

203
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
was that the the maritime sector

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
at least time

205
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
had these challenges with regards to

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
cyber security of course

207
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,840
so low awareness and focus on

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
the on the field on the cyber security

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
the complexity

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
of the ict environment

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
fragmented maritime governance context

212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,519
inadequate consideration of cyber

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
security in maritime regulation

214
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,958
no holistic approach to maritime cyber

215
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
risks and over overall lack of direct

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
economic incentives to implement good

217
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
cyber security in the maritime sector

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
question to you how many of these

219
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
challenges have we really addressed in

220
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
the past 11 years

221
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,760
how good do you think we are doing

222
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
are we doing

223
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,080
well are we doing can we do better are

224
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
we doing terribly

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
well no volunteers i understand this is

226
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
just after lunch so i'll give you a hint

227
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
okay

228
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
well

229
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
this is how the

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
the shipping industry itself perceives

231
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
how they are doing and this comes

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
actually you don't see the answers here

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
you only see the questions

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
i was

235
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
i missed a slight gap or when i sent you

236
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
the slides and then it was too late for

237
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
me to introduce the answers as well but

238
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
i have i have a piece of paper so i'll

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
tell you the answers so this was a

240
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,880
survey done by lloyd's list

241
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
on how the shipping industry themselves

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
perceive how they're doing cyber

243
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
security so

244
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
do we have more attacks

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
the answer is yes we do have more

246
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
attacks we know that right but what is

247
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,279
the severity of attacks

248
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,839
mind you the perceived severity of

249
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,760
attacks well

250
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,000
only 10 percent are perceived to be

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
severe

252
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,320
31

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
are supposed to be significant

254
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,519
52 percent supposed to be or perceived

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
to be minor and and this is the most

256
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,519
alarming to me

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,040
seven percent responded unsure

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,519
not certain

259
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
do you agree that this is the most

260
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
alarming fact because if you know that

261
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,880
you have sustained an attack

262
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
and you're not able to assess the impact

263
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
that the attack had

264
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
alias its severity that's too bad really

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
because it seems it means that you don't

266
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
really know how good you're doing with

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
cyber security or not right

268
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
okay

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
are we doing enough

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,959
well

271
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,920
57 of them say that they could do better

272
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,320
we could do better

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
and only 26 percent are satisfied

274
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
i don't know the correlation between

275
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
this 26 percent and the 7

276
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
that we're unsure about the severity of

277
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
attacks but it would it would have been

278
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
interesting to know

279
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
coming to training because of course it

280
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,160
is a well-known fact that

281
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
one of the crucial factors in improving

282
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,279
the cybersecurity statute of any

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
organization

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
regardless of the

285
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
of the sector is to improve the training

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
right well 54

287
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,839
of the shipping

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,920
of the ship owners responded that they

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
do provide cyber security training which

290
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,920
is not bad

291
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
but it can be it can be better

292
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
and then the question whether there are

293
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
measures in place in the event of an

294
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
attack

295
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,880
63 said yes

296
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
of course the question was not specific

297
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
enough because yes of course the

298
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
shipping industry has measures in case

299
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
of an incident

300
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
but do they have measures

301
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
against cyber attacks in particular

302
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
michael i think this is something you

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
will pick up

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
perhaps

305
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
and then no measures at all 16

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
and again

307
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,839
unsure

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,360
21

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
so they don't know

310
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
do we have measures

311
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,519
sorry don't know

312
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
and finally of course insurance

313
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,000
great 69 are satisfied sure

314
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
then what is the economic

315
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
incentive to do something about cyber

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
security if you think if you believe

317
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
that you're insured against almost

318
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,720
everything that's great then you don't

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
have to invest in cyber security right

320
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
okay

321
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,399
now

322
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
what's the situation uh today

323
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
uh this

324
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
in this uh two slides this one and the

325
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
next maybe three i'm not sure i'm

326
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,079
following a report uh that has been

327
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
issued by norma cyber

328
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
norma is the norwegian maritime cyber

329
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
resilience center it is a center which

330
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
has been established by ownership of

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,680
many major shipping companies in norway

332
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,800
and their issuing annual report so the

333
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
annual threat assessment for 2022 will

334
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
give us a good

335
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,279
a good picture of the landscape as it

336
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,959
stands today

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
and among the the threat actors that we

338
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
identify and this does not only apply to

339
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
norway that's why i'm just using this as

340
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
a guide right

341
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
uh of course nation states

342
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,279
we have

343
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
cyber criminals

344
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
and we have activists as well in fact

345
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,839
i don't think that we have any recorded

346
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,959
incident of hacktivism in the maritime

347
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,680
sector but everyone agrees that it's a

348
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
question of time rather than if

349
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
something like that will will happen

350
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
eventually but of course these days what

351
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,680
is on on stage are nation states

352
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
and

353
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
cyber criminals

354
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
with

355
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
the the goal of monetization of an

356
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
attack

357
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,639
and what kind of threats

358
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
are identified as relevant

359
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
again i followed the structure of the of

360
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,839
the threat report and that means that

361
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
i've followed also the order in which

362
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
the threats appear this is not

363
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,440
any hierarchical order here meaning that

364
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
the first one is more important than the

365
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,120
the last one

366
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
but it somehow reflects

367
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
the uh perception of the importance of

368
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,680
such attacks and it was quite a surprise

369
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
to me that the first one on top uh was

370
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
the espionage

371
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
threat

372
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
yeah i mean it was a surprise because i

373
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,920
had never thought

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
of espionage in the in the maritime

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
sector

376
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,839
as one

377
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,360
really very

378
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
strong threat

379
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
but it appears to be that we do have

380
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,279
evidence that there have been incidents

381
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
like that

382
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
more uh

383
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
possibly well known among them an

384
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,480
incident with a soviet ship

385
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
a research ship

386
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
i think the name was academic lazariff

387
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,320
that was caught following the

388
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
pipelines the oil pipelines between

389
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,720
norway and the uk

390
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
because i mean the ais truck of the of

391
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
the ship was uh analyzed and it was

392
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
found that it was following the the

393
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
pipelines and of course anyone can think

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,000
why this this was happening obviously it

395
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
was not part of an exercise to see

396
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
whether they can navigate

397
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,440
well enough to be able to follow the

398
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
pipelines

399
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,600
then we have of course the supply chain

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
attacks the usual ones not anything

401
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
specific to the maritime sector but

402
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
there have been incidents because of the

403
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
supply to the well-known supply chain

404
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
attacks in the maritime sector

405
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
exploitation of well-known

406
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
vulnerabilities as well

407
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,839
then malware delivery is is common as

408
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
the first step in the

409
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
cyber kill chain of any of any

410
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
attack and unfortunately because of the

411
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,120
poor training

412
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,440
not only of of cruz but also of the

413
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
staff in the

414
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
land basis of the maritime sector is is

415
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,240
quite poor in terms of cyber security uh

416
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,040
this

417
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
method of malware delivery

418
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,839
by

419
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
uh social engineering techniques seems

420
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,880
to be quite quite successful

421
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
then of course credential harvesting

422
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,160
after the the malware delivery is is

423
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
happening and therefore that means that

424
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
attackers have the uh the opportunity to

425
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
get into the into the uh the systems of

426
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,639
the of the attacked

427
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,440
whether

428
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
it's known or not there have been

429
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
incidents even though we have not been

430
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,199
able to attribute them

431
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,519
uh of fishing through in massachusetts

432
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,639
communications and in fact

433
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
this was actually related to credential

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,519
harvesting so there have been attacks

435
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
phishing attacks uh someone or some

436
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
someone's are trying to

437
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,920
map

438
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,039
crew credentials and ship credentials

439
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,799
through

440
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,919
the communications through in

441
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
massachusetts

442
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,839
particularly through the the pandemic

443
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,880
when of course this communication was

444
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
was more useful for

445
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,959
delivering news and so on and in fact

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,599
the cyber security of the satellite

447
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
infrastructure is something that we have

448
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,720
not paid enough attention to i think but

449
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
it's coming up as one of the issues that

450
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,360
need to be looked upon not necessarily

451
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
in the maritime sector itself but in a

452
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
more generic context and then of course

453
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
we have fraud mostly through

454
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
business

455
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
business emails

456
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
fake emails

457
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
and financial fraud and then of course

458
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
the well-known ransomware

459
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
cases now

460
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
i'm usually very bad at keeping time so

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
please shout gabor

462
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,080
i will help you there's the time good

463
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,440
but i think this is my last one so i'm

464
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
not so bad not so terrible eventually

465
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
so

466
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,640
um

467
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
if i go back to the first slide then i

468
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
mean to the slide with the challenges

469
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
identified by iniza 11 years ago i would

470
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,240
say yeah okay there is some progress but

471
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
there is still way to go before we can

472
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
say that we've met those challenges but

473
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
unfortunately or fortunately for us

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,919
security experts there are more

475
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
challenges coming up

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
and some of them

477
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
first of all they derive because of more

478
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
digitalization right nowadays we're

479
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,720
speaking of shipping 4.0

480
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
the equivalent of industry 4.0

481
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
initiative in in the shipping area right

482
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,559
and

483
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,080
one important aspect of this process is

484
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
the integration of it and ot

485
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
not the convergence as many people say

486
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
because convergence has happened at

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
least 15 years ago when ot started using

488
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
i.t but now

489
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
we have an integration of that and the

490
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
situation with this is very similar to

491
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
what had happened more than 20 years ago

492
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
when information technologies and

493
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,840
communication technologies were

494
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,799
integrated and we were forced to change

495
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
the paradigm that we were using for

496
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,039
cyber security

497
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,760
moving from closed systems that we had

498
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,559
to protect against the bad guys

499
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,600
to open systems that would be accessible

500
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
to everyone and then we had to change

501
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
our mindset into transformation to trust

502
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
rather than

503
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
lists of people that could access the

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
closed systems so something like that is

505
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
happening again

506
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,400
but i think it's even more difficult

507
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,559
because

508
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
information

509
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,679
technology people

510
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,000
were always aware of communication

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
technology and vice versa but

512
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,840
unfortunately

513
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,280
those that are

514
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
very good in i.t and iit security are

515
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,039
usually

516
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
quite unknowledgeable about ot and again

517
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
vice versa we simply don't speak the

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
same languages there are very few

519
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
that can understand both worlds this is

520
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
a very major challenge

521
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
another one is of course autonomous

522
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
vessels

523
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
we are already seeing several of those

524
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
in several applications and they do

525
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,320
carry their own

526
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,280
cybersecurity challenges far more

527
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
enhanced and advanced than those of

528
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
conventional vessels and of course

529
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
another variation of autonomous vessels

530
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
as the remotely operated vessels and

531
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
again this is an area where we need to

532
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
do uh to do more

533
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
the final one i've just used one word

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,440
underwater

535
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
there is so much going on underwater now

536
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
and there is so little that we are doing

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,799
to secure what we call the internet of

538
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,000
underwater things that this is a vast

539
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
area that

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
we need to pay attention to and this is

541
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,159
really very very

542
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
challenging area of research

543
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,520
for us there is a lot to do and

544
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,000
hopefully we will be able to do that

545
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,520
before any major incident happens i'm

546
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,600
not only saying that underwater but the

547
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
maritime sector

548
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
in general

549
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,080
i'm usually optimistic so i'm not saying

550
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
that an incident will happen

551
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
but it may

552
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,640
so thank you very much

553
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,640
[Applause]

554
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
thank you very much professor for your

555
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,320
very nice presentation i we agreed

556
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
before the panel we will not dance

557
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
around but still we can't change any

558
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
time well

559
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
we are ready for your questions

560
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
if you do have any

561
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
yes please gentlemen

562
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,679
john

563
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,720
sir

564
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,520
please erwin

565
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,080
i have a question

566
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,159
uh nuclear

567
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,799
airport carrier um schooling people from

568
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,000
on the sea

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
fishing ship uh container ship that has

570
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
fielded here

571
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,760
from

572
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,480
yeah yeah

573
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
you're right of course uh i should have

574
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
mentioned that this uh well being a list

575
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
a survey by lloyd's list it is about of

576
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,039
course

577
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,880
uh merchant money time sector so

578
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,159
no

579
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,880
warshipping involved and i'm sure that

580
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
the perception is is very much uh very

581
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
much different between the civilian and

582
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
the military

583
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,520
sector uh sector there i wouldn't have

584
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
any any data any hard data on the the

585
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,679
military

586
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,200
sector but of course

587
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
i would definitely expect it to be much

588
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,960
much higher

589
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,080
than what it is in the civilian

590
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,960
sector yep

591
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
thank you

592
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,440
okay then i will address a question that

593
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
i'm

594
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
really curious about so we are at

595
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
advancing with the autonomy so the

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,400
weakest point the people is out of the

597
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,080
out of the loop more or less but the

598
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
automation is heavily growing more and

599
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
more itn auto systems are installed on

600
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
the autonomous ships

601
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,279
how do you how do you predict the

602
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,039
shifting of the uh cyber issues

603
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
do you think that uh we will have more

604
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
and more uh

605
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,640
incidents in the

606
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,919
in the area of autonomous shipping or

607
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,840
where we have less because the

608
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,480
autonomous ships are designed by

609
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
being secured

610
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
uh yeah that's a that's a very good

611
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,760
question actually gabor thanks

612
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
and maybe we should we should discuss

613
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,720
this not

614
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,120
uh in the narrow context of the maritime

615
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
sector but i think that whatever i will

616
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
say as an answer will apply to more

617
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
general industry but let's keep it to

618
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
the maritime sector right

619
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
to answer this concretely

620
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,000
i would say that what we need to know is

621
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,279
what percentage of the incidents

622
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,720
are due

623
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
to human error

624
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,520
right

625
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
and of course the uh the reasoning that

626
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,240
if we exclude

627
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
if the percentage of incidents that are

628
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,360
due to human error is quite high and

629
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
then if we do exclude the human factor

630
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,039
from the loop

631
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
then that would automatically mean that

632
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
we should expect less incidents but is

633
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,120
this reasoning really correct

634
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,039
what i would think

635
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
and again no hard data right this is

636
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
just a

637
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,080
an intuition um

638
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,720
yes these kinds of incidents would be

639
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
reduced

640
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
but then there is an additional question

641
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
that needs to be asked would there be

642
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,600
any additional incidents that would not

643
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
have occurred if we had a human in the

644
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
loop

645
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,440
and would occur because we don't have a

646
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
human in the loop

647
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
let me give you a very naive example

648
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,799
right

649
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,159
imagine one of the well-known

650
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,400
cyber security attacks against

651
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,679
navigation

652
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,520
actually the two most known attacks are

653
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
gnss spoofing jamming right

654
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,120
and

655
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,240
ais

656
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
tampering with

657
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
ais

658
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,559
data and in fact you did showcase

659
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,200
an attack with ais in the workshop on on

660
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,080
tuesday right so

661
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
let's take the scenario that you have an

662
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
autonomous ferry

663
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
no human involved right and suddenly

664
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,799
someone launches an attack

665
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
with a few hundred fake

666
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,039
ais trails in the trondheim fjord

667
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,480
right

668
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
great scenario what would the system do

669
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
with today's technology right or if

670
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
the ais was proved so that it showed

671
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,000
the location of the vessel on the shore

672
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,640
rather than in the sea right with

673
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,720
today's technology

674
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
not much of course we are working

675
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,720
towards that right so that we can use ai

676
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
techniques and so on to

677
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
recognize that something is wrong but we

678
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
couldn't be able to do much it's the

679
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
human operator

680
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
on board the ship that knows that this

681
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
cannot be correct right

682
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,559
so

683
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,120
to recap

684
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,559
i think we would be having less

685
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
incidents that are due to the human

686
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,919
factor naturally but we would be having

687
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,240
different incidents that we don't have

688
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
today now

689
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,799
quantitatively whether the latter would

690
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
be more or more severe than the the

691
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
former i can't know but

692
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
i don't think that this is something

693
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
that should stop us or

694
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,279
slower the pace of automation because

695
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,600
there are so many advantages

696
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,039
thank you

697
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,880
well i've been considering that going to

698
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,279
to an autonomous ship with my with my uh

699
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,159
motorboat and with fake ais messages uh

700
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
stealing it

701
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,640
but uh this attack would be

702
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
from this c

703
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,039
but uh our next speaker

704
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,880
dr michael thomas

705
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,200
brought scenarios the in which the

706
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
attacks are

707
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,279
addressed from the land

708
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,080
so

709
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
let's uh thank you very much professor

710
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
for the problems

711
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
and let's dig deeper

712
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,399
our next speaker is dr michael thomas

713
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,799
who is a retired colonel

714
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,279
and currently assigned to maxwell air

715
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,919
force base alabama as a professor of

716
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,679
cyber cyber air force studies previously

717
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,919
he was served at naval

718
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,399
information warfare center

719
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
as an ice

720
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,360
c4 isr system engineer in communication

721
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,000
and network division and was responsible

722
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
for design implementation and

723
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
fielding of major systems engineering

724
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
project for us navy

725
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
he served in several offices like at the

726
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
pentagon at the joint special operations

727
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
command and at the air force institution

728
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,720
of technology

729
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,200
mike the floor is yours please

730
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,080
introduce your results thank you goodbye

731
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,480
you for the nice introduction and

732
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,039
thank you for attending

733
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,799
the

734
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,720
topic is going to float between

735
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,480
both the military and the civilian

736
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,600
sector

737
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
because a lot of them have things in

738
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,559
common just as there are things in

739
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
common between

740
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
platform technology and the air force

741
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,520
and platform technology in the navy

742
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
the current navy ship building has had

743
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
some issues

744
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,559
ship classes have been cut

745
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,440
vessels retired early

746
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
many are waiting years for

747
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,960
repairs

748
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,320
the lcs the littoral combat ship

749
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
has been an example of the adoption of

750
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,039
tech and tech failing

751
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
the zumwalt class stealth destroyer is

752
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,640
being cut back

753
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
from plan 32

754
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,919
to only three

755
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,159
and the implementation of a rail gun on

756
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,200
board has been abandoned

757
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
ford class carriers have got

758
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
all sorts of issues with catapults

759
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,840
radars elevators

760
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
cost overruns

761
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
shipbuilding capacity has been minimized

762
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,120
there is

763
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,840
a quality to quantity and right now the

764
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
people's republic of china is out

765
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
building us and us i say the u.s

766
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,039
historically a nation's rise and decline

767
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
has been directly linked to the power of

768
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
its navy

769
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
the current world order

770
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
was established at the end of world war

771
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,480
ii

772
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
with the united states guaranteeing the

773
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,679
freedom of the seas

774
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,440
and encouraging

775
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,000
britain the france

776
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,679
not to rebuild their navies and begin

777
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
another arms race in the maritime sector

778
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,600
that we would guarantee

779
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,399
freedom of the seas for them and they

780
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,679
could do their

781
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,880
uh

782
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,919
world trade under our banner

783
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
the um

784
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
the issue of the size of the navy has

785
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
has been discussed in the past at the

786
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,039
end of world war ii we had six thousand

787
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,799
ships in the navy

788
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
reagan bankrupted

789
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,039
uh or convinced the soviet union that

790
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,559
they could never outspend just by only

791
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,880
wanting 600 ships in the navy

792
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,519
right now we've got about 350 ships and

793
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,279
the proposal has been

794
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,640
uh to increase that to 450 ships

795
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,840
what kind of platforms are we talking

796
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,159
about stated earlier 90 percent of the

797
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,640
world's traffic in commercial traffic is

798
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,440
done at sea

799
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,559
90 to 95 depending on the statistic

800
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,640
of the internet

801
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
international internet is under the sea

802
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,519
so the sea is very important to the

803
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,840
current information environment

804
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
there's a major study in

805
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,399
19 in 2019

806
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,519
that talked

807
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,360
about almost 60 open source incidents

808
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,279
involving only the components of the

809
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,760
integrated bridge system that ip based

810
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
network on the bridge that has

811
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,360
both data and connectivity

812
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
to the outside world

813
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,279
uh examples of this

814
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,760
uh has been by either disabling and

815
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
spoofing ais

816
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
by russia iran and north korea

817
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,679
due to masking movements

818
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,600
there was an article in the in the news

819
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,919
feeds this morning about the shipping of

820
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
oil and the russians using the same

821
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,880
techniques as the north koreans to turn

822
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,679
their

823
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,760
ais and gps off

824
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,519
running dark to trans transport

825
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,039
ship oil

826
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
sanctioned oil from a russian vessel to

827
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
a non-russian vessel

828
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,279
even for sale in the u.s

829
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,480
nga has provided

830
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,480
maritime charts to the u.s navy and to

831
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
the commercial sector but not all the

832
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
charts are of the same quality

833
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
and in fact the electronic charting

834
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,760
system on board

835
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
using bad

836
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
uh data

837
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
has shown some vulnerabilities

838
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,640
both to html html injects

839
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
our

840
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
outmoded

841
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
operating systems on board

842
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,640
jamming gps is not difficult to do

843
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,880
and in fact the

844
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,159
uh power of a gps signal is said to be

845
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
about that of a 25 watt bulb

846
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,360
the

847
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,880
sensitivity of the receiver is what's

848
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,480
important uh

849
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,720
data indexed at gps

850
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,760
using poorly secured satcom terminals on

851
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,799
board

852
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,799
that might be linked to

853
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
uh the gps enabled

854
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,440
autopilot onboard the ship

855
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,039
has created problems

856
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,840
the uss guardian

857
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,799
in naval history had inaccurate

858
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,279
uh nga data loaded on their electronic

859
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,760
charts and caused it to run aground

860
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,279
uh the uss john mccain

861
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,880
faulty nav

862
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,799
poor sailoring poor manning and poor

863
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,039
equipment implementation as well finally

864
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,039
the uss donald cook

865
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,120
had their gps jammed by a russian

866
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,159
aircraft

867
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,840
so it happens

868
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,040
let's take a look real quick

869
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,480
yeah we'll watch the first minute and a

870
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,918
half of this do i have sound on this

871
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
no

872
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,119
there there is a

873
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,480
an audio track to this as well

874
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
maybe you need to be out of presentation

875
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,480
mode for it to play

876
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,760
no it'll it'll

877
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,280
it'll play in the presentation mode okay

878
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
there's a there's a uh

879
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,719
if you go down to the bottom of the

880
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,719
screen there's a toolbar on the far left

881
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,520
and it should appear

882
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,639
all right go go out of presentation mode

883
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,119
for a second

884
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,839
do we have

885
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,720
audio

886
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,320
i think we do have but

887
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,359
i

888
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,920
think we have to check the details

889
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,200
no there's a there's an audio there's a

890
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,680
video embedded in the slide

891
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
and if you click on the body of the

892
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,480
slide it'll begin playing

893
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,200
it's only

894
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
you see it's a picture

895
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,040
and we have to deal with huge shifts so

896
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
okay sorry that's a challenge i expected

897
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,680
the audience to anyway the the audio is

898
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,839
a story that was on cnbc go back to the

899
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,520
presentation end of that slide and i'll

900
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
continue

901
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
that showed the

902
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,720
nsa was training college students to

903
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,959
um

904
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,200
[Music]

905
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,240
hack

906
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
integrated bridge system technology and

907
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,839
one of the young students reflected on

908
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,680
uh how much damage in the economy they

909
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
could do to a country

910
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,520
all right what does the attack surface

911
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
in the ship look like

912
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,560
navigation data can be in the cloud

913
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
you've got port infrastructure

914
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,920
mainland computer systems at the

915
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
companies

916
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
all sorts routes procedures and

917
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
personnel

918
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,839
who are the bad actors

919
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
as my colleague earlier mentioned

920
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,560
nation states rival companies

921
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,720
criminals pirates

922
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,079
are

923
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,160
independent freelance hackers

924
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,520
and then of course insiders as well

925
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
a little bit of history

926
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,280
um

927
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,800
typically

928
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
the uh

929
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
if we look at the top the cyber

930
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,920
interacts industry 3.0 and industry 4.0

931
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,000
was when we started seeing

932
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,960
uh automated systems introduced first to

933
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
scada then as

934
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,480
it linked to scada

935
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
this is another

936
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
video

937
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,880
i would love to see these dots moving

938
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,079
but apparently they're not going to do

939
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,480
it each dot being a ship

940
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
and each ship

941
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,040
having

942
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,839
uh different systems on board

943
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,160
in different sets of systems

944
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
the bridge system being composed of

945
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
course of ais

946
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,599
the charting gps gyrocompass radar and

947
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,560
weather

948
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,880
tampering with any of those can have

949
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
very deleterious effects

950
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,320
on the outcome

951
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,200
the problem also happens to be when you

952
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
cross the navigation

953
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,240
into the marine systems or the

954
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,359
propulsion and steering

955
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,560
cyber attacks on board a vessel often

956
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,440
occur because those systems are no

957
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,200
longer segregated

958
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,440
companies wanting minimal manning and

959
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,040
wanting to check and check the

960
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
status of where ship is and how it's

961
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,000
performing

962
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,280
will often

963
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,000
go through the ip based network

964
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,640
across the bus into the control systems

965
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
to look at fuel consumption

966
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,839
uh performance if they're monitoring the

967
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,640
ballast properly and create a create an

968
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,160
issue

969
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,040
gps simulators can be uh

970
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
purchased for very little money and used

971
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,960
as a platform to inject an ascii

972
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
character 12 to 18

973
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
ascii characters

974
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,440
through the satcom

975
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
until there's a ship that would normally

976
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,839
be ready to turn left for example you

977
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,240
change the l to an r and it turns right

978
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
it's been demonstrated on a container

979
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,280
ship back in 1918 pentest partners

980
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,480
showed that access into

981
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,960
the steering

982
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,359
steering and throttle was possible

983
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,480
using such an approach

984
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,160
again the volume of global tonnage we

985
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
can believe

986
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
back in march 2021 when the ever given

987
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
was jammed inside the suez canal the

988
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,280
disruption on global trade that was felt

989
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
and for a short time

990
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,280
the impact

991
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,119
was known and was being paid attention

992
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,480
to

993
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,359
um

994
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,560
there was another

995
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,800
attack on a merchant vessel in june of

996
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,359
2019

997
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,079
cyber attack they're not sure if it was

998
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,560
targeted by hackers or if one of the

999
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,520
crew

1000
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,760
entertainment uh

1001
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,200
i.t based products had malware injected

1002
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,960
uh accidentally or intentionally by the

1003
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
crew

1004
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
but it was a deep dress vessel bound for

1005
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,079
new york and it was totally debilitated

1006
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,359
by malware they had to fly a white team

1007
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,680
crew out and actually

1008
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,680
basically reboot the reboot the ship

1009
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,920
we published data

1010
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,079
online

1011
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
depending on the size of the ship a ship

1012
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,079
may have to ping every five four five

1013
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,040
seconds its location and heading

1014
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
and speed and that's

1015
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,480
broadcast on an open network

1016
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,319
for the world to see so the information

1017
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,680
is there target selection is a

1018
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760
possibility

1019
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
what the ever given provided was the

1020
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,359
idea

1021
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,599
that block ships could come back in

1022
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,560
vogue a block ship being something that

1023
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,520
was

1024
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,680
uh blocking a channel

1025
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
uh the russian navy did this as early as

1026
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,119
2014 as recently as 2014

1027
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,160
when they

1028
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
sunk a derelict vessel

1029
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,319
at the bay in crimea and basically

1030
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,000
trapped most of the ukrainian navy

1031
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,880
taking possession of it

1032
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,760
um

1033
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
if we look at the red circle

1034
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,319
uh april 1 2021

1035
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,960
uh we see what is called a navy task

1036
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,920
force heading towards the suez canal

1037
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
this is immediately after

1038
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,880
the ever kevin has been refloated

1039
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,359
as we start to move it by april 8th it

1040
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,880
is through the canal

1041
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
and on its mission on the way to its

1042
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
mission further in the persian gulf and

1043
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,839
then finally by the 15th it's on station

1044
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,400
uh just outside the persian gulf

1045
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,839
for counter piracy maneuvers

1046
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,319
this is a view from the uss monterey

1047
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,359
part of the eisenhower strike group

1048
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,560
that was displayed on the charts

1049
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,599
imagine

1050
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,760
being stuck

1051
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,480
in the canal with a block ship and then

1052
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
being targeted

1053
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,599
by

1054
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,680
people with floating bombs

1055
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
uh

1056
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,920
it would totally

1057
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,800
eliminate the success of this mission

1058
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,160
uh that occurred in may where they

1059
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,760
grabbed a lot of russian-made anti-tank

1060
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
weapons

1061
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,599
uh and route for somewhere

1062
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,599
but but basically what would happen is

1063
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,119
that you could establish three separate

1064
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,319
kill zones

1065
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,880
north in the great bitter lake and then

1066
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
south

1067
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
with traffic backed up

1068
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,119
and in fact this is exactly what

1069
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,520
happened to the uss coal back in 12

1070
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
october a small

1071
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,400
uh

1072
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,599
floating

1073
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,480
uh

1074
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
floating bomb got close enough to take

1075
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,000
out a piece of it

1076
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,240
the ship was able to be recovered taken

1077
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,560
back and rebuilt and is still in service

1078
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,359
but a determined enemy

1079
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,680
uh using this vector of attack could

1080
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,240
disable either

1081
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,240
military or civilian shipping

1082
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,160
one scenario protection of pipelines and

1083
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,480
subsidy cables has been proposed

1084
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
um

1085
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,440
people have to know where the subsea

1086
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,839
cables are we advertise where they are

1087
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,319
because we don't want ships running into

1088
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,240
them running over them fishermen

1089
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,040
dropping their anchors on top of them

1090
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,119
disrupts the internet

1091
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
but in fact

1092
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,800
not too long ago

1093
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,880
there was an occurrence of

1094
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,760
a ship

1095
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
subsidy cable being cut

1096
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,920
between the northern coast of norway

1097
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
and svalbard

1098
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,240
that disrupted internet traffic

1099
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
interesting it took out one but didn't

1100
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,720
take out the other one

1101
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,800
another scenario

1102
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,480
cyber attacks against shipping and

1103
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,280
shore-based infrastructure

1104
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,640
some of this has been occurring in the

1105
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,560
run-up to the ukraine war where lng

1106
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,480
tankers in the u.s were actually

1107
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
targeted

1108
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,560
and disrupted

1109
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
an lng tanker again

1110
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,200
a floating vessel with high pressure

1111
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,599
tanks

1112
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,680
lots of

1113
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,079
kinetic energy potential energy stored

1114
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,720
in that compressed gas

1115
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,119
the concerns of

1116
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,200
lng tanker accidents in the boston

1117
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,520
channel has been documented over and

1118
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,160
over again in the last 50 years

1119
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,599
um

1120
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
with the current technology if a an lng

1121
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,280
tanker were jammed or taking control

1122
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
in a populated area you could

1123
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,599
potentially have nuclear effects without

1124
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,200
having a weapon of mass destruction

1125
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,359
boston channel again

1126
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,040
shows some of the

1127
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,240
affected areas that would be in there

1128
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,680
cyber-enabled underwater weapons

1129
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,160
targets abound examples are

1130
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,839
pipelines coming from north africa

1131
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,560
supplying

1132
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,240
hydrocarbons to

1133
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,000
southern europe

1134
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,280
in real life

1135
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,880
again

1136
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,640
russia has been

1137
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,720
attributed to having had something to do

1138
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,839
with the subsidy cable

1139
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,640
cut

1140
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,880
and it's not just russia france has in

1141
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,760
fact

1142
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,160
uh created a strategy for underwater

1143
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,480
warfare and is prepared

1144
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,880
uh to move forward with this capability

1145
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,440
in the coming decade

1146
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,240
shooting and blocking dangerous

1147
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
exercises again

1148
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,040
once

1149
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,760
a ship is under control of some

1150
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,880
uh

1151
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
negative party

1152
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,920
uh

1153
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,200
how are they gonna handle it what are

1154
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,800
they going to do with it

1155
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
a control zone outside one of the

1156
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,040
islands in open water again

1157
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
uh the graphic didn't come through

1158
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,000
either

1159
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,480
beijing has got lots of

1160
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,079
uh

1161
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,480
encroachments into other areas of the

1162
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,359
south china sea

1163
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,920
um so some tactical advice for maritime

1164
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,319
cyber security we'll look at tactical

1165
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,319
operational and strategic

1166
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,280
um

1167
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,720
make sure your i your ais uh

1168
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
is secured your satcom is secured your

1169
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,400
ip based network uh is secured

1170
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,359
um

1171
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
crew and the wi-fi are and business

1172
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,000
networks are logically separated there's

1173
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,880
no need to have your crew email system

1174
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
connected to the rest of the bridge

1175
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,920
usb ports secure this is all basic stuff

1176
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
check on board for the wi-fi networks

1177
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,800
don't over rely on technology

1178
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,920
that was part of the problem with the

1179
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,079
mccain the bridge crew thought they were

1180
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,680
where they weren't

1181
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,280
and ended up running into a container

1182
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,640
ship

1183
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,079
teach your crew about cyber security

1184
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,240
that's going to be a difficult one with

1185
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,599
the number of people

1186
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,800
on the vessels and the crew rotations

1187
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,079
that occur

1188
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,640
technology suppliers

1189
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,400
have to prove to you that they are

1190
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,240
secure uh you shouldn't have to be doing

1191
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,520
it all by yourself

1192
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,880
there are companies out there that will

1193
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,680
do

1194
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,160
a cyber security audit for you this is

1195
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
something before you allow a vessel into

1196
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,960
your waters legislation can

1197
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,560
be introduced

1198
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,400
so that it is safe it can it has to

1199
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,680
prove that it's safe to be in those

1200
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,359
waters

1201
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,200
operational advice has been put out by

1202
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,319
bimco

1203
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,440
uh

1204
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,119
you know a cyber risk management

1205
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,000
approach

1206
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,880
in

1207
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,720
in a

1208
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,359
multi-stage environment

1209
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,720
but again

1210
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,040
developed the philosophy for the vessel

1211
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,000
design

1212
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,440
designed for robustness and then of

1213
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,640
course system resilience

1214
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,280
operational advice again

1215
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,200
you've got to look at the entire

1216
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,118
package in a system of systems approach

1217
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,160
so

1218
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,000
the atlantic council came out with

1219
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,880
strategic advice for the implementation

1220
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,240
of policy legislation

1221
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
large scale measures that should be

1222
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,000
adopted globally

1223
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,040
and more

1224
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,440
more strategic advice eventually we're

1225
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,040
going to a more remote control

1226
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,359
environment for floating vessels it's

1227
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,359
going to be a problem the navies of the

1228
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,680
world as well as the commercial sectors

1229
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,079
have adopted this as a means of keeping

1230
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,000
the number of floating platforms up to

1231
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,839
have increased capability

1232
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,200
um

1233
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,839
in fact the navy just introduced

1234
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,839
a

1235
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,040
new uh

1236
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,280
float a new sub command

1237
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,480
uh to be held in uh navworm

1238
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,319
in dahlgren

1239
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,520
that will

1240
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,839
in fact be in charge of uh floating

1241
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,400
floating vessels automated vessels uh

1242
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,760
one test result a year ago from darpa

1243
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,400
they sailed a 50-foot vessel from san

1244
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,880
diego to honolulu in back with no one on

1245
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,839
board

1246
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,559
so

1247
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,359
the technology both in warships and in

1248
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,200
commercial shipping is

1249
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,960
on the on the rise

1250
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,319
so

1251
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,920
dunn and kruger always like it we

1252
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,680
started at the peak amount stupid

1253
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,359
halfway through maybe we started having

1254
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,640
some hope

1255
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,559
all the way through the slides

1256
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,680
we've become a little bit more

1257
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,800
enlightened

1258
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,640
but sometime in the future driven by

1259
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,319
mission requirements we're going to have

1260
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,720
to have some way

1261
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,880
and definition of what a sustainment for

1262
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,800
these new automated

1263
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,960
platforms are going to be

1264
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,040
and if no one has got questions

1265
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,839
that's the end of my material

1266
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,720
thank you very much uh for your

1267
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,960
excellent uh presentation and the brief

1268
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,800
overview

1269
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,760
i'm not scared i knew about it but uh i

1270
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,000
think that uh our audience might wish to

1271
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,359
address some questions please

1272
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,839
in the back

1273
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,319
i thought i saw a hand up

1274
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,440
okay

1275
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,839
uh

1276
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,680
two questions pop up in my mind

1277
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,839
how do you estimate uh

1278
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,720
how

1279
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,760
confident the sector is and how clever

1280
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,599
the sector is right now

1281
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,440
on the

1282
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,760
tunneling club graph

1283
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,599
in which stage we are

1284
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,440
oh um

1285
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,680
we're in the nation's stages

1286
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,960
of implementation and security

1287
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,359
uh it's largely been ignored

1288
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,680
because most

1289
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,359
people just want to go to the beach they

1290
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,800
don't want to think about

1291
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
the industrial controls and the ip based

1292
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,319
controls

1293
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,640
necessary to have safe

1294
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,680
a safe maritime working environment um

1295
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,599
if you think of

1296
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,000
uh the number of incidents in private

1297
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,920
homes and in businesses

1298
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,040
um

1299
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,079
there's still a market for

1300
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,960
people wanting to create havoc so it's

1301
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,880
an extension of that into a moving

1302
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,760
environment at sea

1303
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,920
regarding the please in maritime as i i

1304
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,319
i'm observing that the current trend is

1305
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,960
to train maritime personnel and people

1306
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,119
working in maritime teach them cyber

1307
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,559
security

1308
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,160
and there still is a lack of as i have

1309
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,000
witnessed lack of

1310
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,160
skillful people in cyber security in the

1311
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,960
american domain how can we or is it

1312
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,280
possible or is it feasible to do the

1313
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,920
other way which is teaching maritime

1314
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,599
affairs and

1315
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,319
concepts and the aspects of the maritime

1316
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,599
industry

1317
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,680
to be able in cyber security there's a

1318
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,760
lot of people knowing it knowing ot

1319
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,079
security but they have no idea about

1320
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,240
maritime and what is needed to secure

1321
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,760
martian system

1322
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,760
would this be something

1323
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,960
useful or how can it be

1324
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,800
um let me let me tell a story and then

1325
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,319
tell another story

1326
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,440
last august at def con

1327
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
they have a hack to see

1328
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,040
competition

1329
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,920
uh the the the goal is to win the black

1330
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,839
coveted black badge

1331
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:42,960
um

1332
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,000
a team

1333
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,240
with only land-based skills

1334
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,160
uh was able to plug in and take control

1335
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,040
of both the the

1336
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,520
integrated bridge simulator as well as

1337
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,800
steering

1338
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,119
and throttle within it within a few

1339
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,119
hours

1340
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,760
it doesn't take a lot for clever people

1341
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,040
to look at systems and see what they do

1342
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,599
particularly systems that

1343
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,960
maybe 15 20 years old weren't designed

1344
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,200
with security in and i'm talking

1345
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,400
that lower section of the integrated

1346
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,800
controls that would be called scada or

1347
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
ics on land

1348
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,680
um

1349
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
the second um

1350
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,880
there's a guy named joe weissman

1351
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,400
he's an expert

1352
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,359
in cyber security marine maritime cyber

1353
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,160
security uh did a talk for us on our

1354
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,480
virtual cyber seminar series

1355
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,800
uh and said that

1356
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,280
the internet of things that helped run a

1357
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,160
ship

1358
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,599
uh the pumps

1359
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,480
uh

1360
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,280
the

1361
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,000
motors and whatnot uh

1362
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
are not built

1363
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,119
with any type of cyber security built

1364
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,920
into them at all and the people that

1365
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,119
designed them

1366
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,480
don't know the language of cyber

1367
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,960
security so some of it can be very very

1368
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,640
easy some of it can be very very

1369
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,118
difficult

1370
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,200
other questions

1371
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
i think that you have a better overview

1372
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,920
on the on the sector

1373
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,480
so that's always a good excuse okay our

1374
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,559
technology is old we cannot introduce

1375
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,640
any cyber security measure at the same

1376
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,800
time international magnum organization

1377
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,040
uh made compulsory the cyber assessment

1378
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
for ships uh

1379
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,359
how do you see in your country is are

1380
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,000
these recommendations followed or just

1381
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,520
omitted and told that okay the

1382
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,359
technology is old

1383
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,160
there are some um

1384
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,079
some good steps being taken and

1385
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,800
recommendations being made

1386
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,200
but even um

1387
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,119
uh off the east coast of africa you've

1388
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,079
got

1389
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,640
legitimate commercial haulers turning

1390
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,240
off their ais

1391
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,800
so that somali pirates won't

1392
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,599
won't be able to identify them

1393
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,280
for target selection

1394
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,319
uh

1395
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,480
the russians uh turn theirs off for the

1396
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
sake of sanctions avoidance the north

1397
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,040
koreans turn theirs off and the

1398
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,160
um

1399
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,480
for the sake of uh

1400
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,040
sanctions avoidance we know they're out

1401
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,920
there

1402
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,079
uh reports are thousand page reports are

1403
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,599
generated every year by the united

1404
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,400
nations uh the question becomes

1405
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,160
what incentivizes

1406
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,839
the rest of the industry to do something

1407
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,880
about it

1408
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,079
and i don't have the answer to that

1409
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,119
you mentioned russia several times uh

1410
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,680
how can the sector attribute the attacks

1411
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
well it you know it's interesting using

1412
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,839
uh

1413
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,160
geoint and satellite-based technology

1414
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,240
most

1415
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,920
freighters of a certain length and a

1416
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,960
certain

1417
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,000
width

1418
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,520
have

1419
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,359
something the equivalent of a figure of

1420
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,640
a fingerprint

1421
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
in the way the deck is configured

1422
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,119
antennas where the bridge is

1423
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:55,920
uh

1424
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,240
where hard structures are placed so a

1425
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,160
ship can be identified relatively

1426
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,160
accurately and then can be tracked from

1427
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,200
space

1428
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,559
so an integration of uh

1429
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,640
uh geoint and a geo enabled tracking

1430
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,240
uh for that

1431
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,000
uh as well as

1432
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,559
uh keeping track of the ship uh when it

1433
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,599
when it meets up with another vessel

1434
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,200
does the cross

1435
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,760
platform transfer the sanctioned goods

1436
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,440
and then tracking where it where it goes

1437
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,480
either to north korea or uh even some to

1438
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,760
the united states

1439
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,160
i see but in the land case attacks it

1440
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,359
would be a

1441
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,119
more challenging task right yeah well

1442
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,440
there's a smuggling smuggling is what

1443
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,960
we're talking about high-tech

1444
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,839
smuggling yeah excellent thank you very

1445
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,160
much i hope and believe you preserved

1446
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,118
some questions for the uh very end and

1447
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,839
let's keep moving uh honest speaker is a

1448
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,119

how to solve the problem that was uh

1476
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,920
figured out right now

1477

00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,960
several years ago i was attending uh as

1488
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,200
a participant

1489
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,359

anyway before moving on please allow me

1492
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,599
to share my screen first

1493
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,280
first of all to do this myself i was at

1494
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,640
the you mentioned i'm retired journal

1495
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,680
and

1496
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,040
currently

1497
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,680
involved in the european defense agency

1498
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,599
managing research and technology

1499
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,440
innovation projects in cyber and

1500
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,359
information technology

1501
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,119
before that

1502
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,040
i had the opportunity to work also in

1503
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,119
the private sector that gave me also the

1504
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,359
opportunity to get involved in projects

1505
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,160
related to maritime cyber security

1506
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,119
with

1507
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,400
the experience that i can share with you

1508
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,720
in my presentation that will try to

1509
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,839
address to identify what we can do what

1510
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,599
are the medication

1511
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,640
measures

1512
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,960
for addressing the challenges that have

1513
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,520
been identified so far

1514
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,760
so let me share

1515
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,839
my presentation let's hope technology

1516
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,319
will help us

1517
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,920
okay can you please confirm that you can

1518
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,040
see my slide in full

1519
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,200
yes please please

1520
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,359
okay we can see your slide

1521
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,640
perfect

1522
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,640
so mitigating the cyber threat in

1523
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,480
maritime sector what are the key

1524
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,680
principles

1525
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,359
for

1526
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,880
cyber security for medication threats

1527
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,359
initially just to say that i will not

1528
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,640
try to use any

1529
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,000
known already worked and applied in the

1530
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,920
land of the traditional let's say cyber

1531
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,040
security area so what we need actually

1532
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,440
in the maritime sector is to tailor to

1533
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,640
customize technology and processes to be

1534
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,200
applicable in the specific environment

1535
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,960
of maritime sector

1536
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,640
so what are the key principles is to

1537
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,160
identify the threat which is something

1538
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,960
that my colleagues already the previous

1539
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,880
speakers have already addressed that it

1540
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,440
was part of

1541
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,200
the panel

1542
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,520
risk management detect and protect

1543
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,240
respondent recover secure architecture

1544
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,160
user awareness and training and security

1545
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,799
compliance

1546
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,440
let's move on one by one so by risk

1547
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,240
management which is actually includes uh

1548
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,200
the identification of threads uh

1549
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,280
we can see that

1550
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,079
those are the four key

1551
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,839
elements that

1552
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,640
consist the risk management first of all

1553
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,400
and especially for maritime we need an

1554
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,880
asset inventory and a sufficient ascent

1555
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,400
management

1556
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,359
system

1557
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,319
why because uh one of the biggest

1558
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,920
problems in maritime sector in the

1559
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,480
recipient industry is to know

1560
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,599
our to know their assets

1561
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,880
many times

1562
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,319
failures or incidents come from

1563
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,960
devices that are

1564
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,200
forgotten the thermistor not something

1565
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,839
new to the cyber security domain as we

1566
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,400
all know but in the shipping industry

1567
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,160
combined the land the shore the port and

1568
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,880
the

1569
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,799
vessels technology

1570
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,079
there are assets that are forgotten also

1571
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,119
more

1572
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,280
specifically and more importantly in the

1573
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,400
ot

1574
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,720
area operational technology assets also

1575
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,480
need to be

1576
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,119
monitored and managed continuously

1577
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,280
because of their sensitivity and their

1578
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,200
impact in case of any security incident

1579
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,359
gap analysis we need to identify the

1580
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,240
technology and administrative gaps

1581
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,760
every shipping

1582
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,000
industry in the maritime sector need to

1583
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,559
know what are the gaps they need to know

1584
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,240
where the threat comes from either for

1585
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,559
their offices or

1586
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,680
from the ship and the vessels

1587
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,960
themselves

1588
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,640
then we need to assess there is to

1589
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,359
identify the risk and accessories many

1590
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,880
times

1591
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,680
we can see that there is a poor risk

1592
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,440
assessment in

1593
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,680
the maritime sector

1594
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,680
i have seen risk assessment that just

1595
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
consists of a five to six

1596
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,280
major global let's say transparent

1597
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,000
risks that do not actually apply to the

1598
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,039
specific environment so a risk

1599
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,359
identification is something that

1600
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,520
requires a lot of effort and

1601
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,000
focus for each shipping

1602
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,599
industry

1603
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,160
it's time risk treatment not only

1604
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,119
identify the risks but also to define

1605
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,760
security controls that will mitigate its

1606
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,520
identified risk

1607
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,359
again as i told you just something new

1608
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,680
but what i have seen

1609
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,200
from my previous experience in the

1610
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,599
private sector it is something that does

1611
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,960
not

1612
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,440
performed well it does not perform

1613
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,280
sufficiently meaning that at the end

1614
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,200
shipping owners and management

1615
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,000
at the management level do not know why

1616
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,640
they need to invest on cyber security

1617
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,680
technology and people

1618
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,760
detect and protect again we are

1619
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,520
following the guidelines from mist okay

1620
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,240
the overall principles in cyber security

1621
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,760
in order to

1622
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,079
be able to protect our systems we need

1623
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,640
to detect the threat

1624
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,480
some key points for detect and

1625
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,720
protection are the following endpoint

1626
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,520
detection technology currently

1627
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,760
we can see that technology offers

1628
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,079
advanced endpoint detection response

1629
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,839
solutions

1630
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,160
agent-based technology that can be

1631
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,039
installed and applied to every iit

1632
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,400
system both

1633
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,119
offshore and on-board

1634
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,079
that can give a sufficient protection

1635
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,520
and

1636
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,680
explain in terms of detection and

1637
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,200
response to the i.t systems

1638
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,079
and also to some of the ot

1639
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,720
that means that

1640
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,520
in maritime sector shipping industry can

1641
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,319
rely on that advanced technology because

1642
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,359
it offers advanced automation and much

1643
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,720
more much more sufficient protection for

1644
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,799
from cyber threats vulnerability

1645
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,079
management again some a critical

1646
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,359
issue

1647
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,200
that requires continuous assessment and

1648
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,559
medication prioritization including

1649
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,039
operational technology

1650
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,480
i have

1651
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,640
the opportunity to see some

1652
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,760
new

1653
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,720
technology solutions in terms of

1654
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,000
in the context of vulnerability

1655
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,240
management and vulnerability assessment

1656
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,720
solutions and software that include

1657
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,319
operational technology assets and that

1658
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,160
and which also

1659
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,920
based on some specific recommended

1660
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,280
architecture can also work on board

1661
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,119
for vessels that even

1662
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,880
during

1663
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,520
shipping during sailing can provide

1664
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,280
sufficient vulnerability detection

1665
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,520
management they use cloud technology and

1666
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,480
they have the also the capacity and the

1667
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,240
technology to er to work in the isolated

1668
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,119
in an isolated environment like a vessel

1669
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,720
either way we all understand how

1670
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,640
important it is to detect

1671
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,839
vulnerabilities early enough to mitigate

1672
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,240
the potential threats the real time is

1673
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,000
just an awareness again something really

1674
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,720
critical that involves collection

1675
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,280
process and analysis of digital asset

1676
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,440
security information what's security

1677
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,680
information we are talking about logs we

1678
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,920
are talking about everything that could

1679
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,039
provide the cyber hygiene of every

1680
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,000
digital asset especially on board and

1681
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,440
this is something critical because

1682
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,160
management usually takes place from the

1683
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,760
headquarter so the id and security team

1684
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,880
need to know for every visa

1685
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,559
the security

1686
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,240
status

1687
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
but

1688
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,920
in real time

1689
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,280
of course it's not easy however now

1690
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,839
technology and current internet bad

1691
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:51,520
reference solutions offer that kind of

1692
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,200
solution that kind of capacity to

1693
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,160
collect

1694
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,400
send data

1695
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,359
to

1696
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,920
a management central management console

1697
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,640
that could efficiently

1698
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,960
process and analyze the data providing

1699
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,720
to

1700
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,240
the security team

1701
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,799
the right picture threat intelligence

1702
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,160
this is something

1703
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,240
really important in global

1704
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,680
because that will drive uh how we can

1705
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,079
detect and respond to cyber attacks uh

1706
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,799
maritime and based on the what we have

1707
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,960
seen lately we can see that there is an

1708
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,640
increased number of cyber efforts in

1709
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,119
cyber attacks successful cyber attacks

1710
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,160
so we need to communicate how these have

1711
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,359
been

1712
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,280
successfully performed what are the

1713
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,760
medication measures and what we can do

1714
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,839
to share information

1715
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,400
for successfully mitigating the threats

1716
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,559
path management really important and

1717
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,799
really difficult prioritization and

1718
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,880
patching the vulnerable systems it is

1719
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,920
not really straightforward even in the

1720
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,559
traditional i.t

1721
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,079
area

1722
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,319
we can understand that there are a lot

1723
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,640
of old systems in the

1724
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,440
shipping sector in the maritime sector

1725
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,720
that makes any patching process really

1726
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,680
hard and really difficult especially for

1727
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,079
systems that are on business that are on

1728
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,440
board and we cannot properly test them

1729
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,760
and to make the right process so it is

1730
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,920
something that is really a headache in

1731
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,000
the maritime sector but still needs to

1732
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,200
be addressed properly

1733
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,440
respond and recover

1734
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,880
something really important in

1735
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,480
the

1736
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,039
domain this in the security domain that

1737
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,119
involves a incident management plan and

1738
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,119
this response capabilities and here it

1739
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,559
is where

1740
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,400
cpic industry in maritime state needs to

1741
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,720
identify how they can

1742
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,160
deliver

1743
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,880
those capabilities

1744
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,559
most likely and

1745
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,520
it is something well realized it's not a

1746
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,640
capacity that can be developed in-house

1747
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,440
uh

1748
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,359
maritime center and many and more and

1749
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,880
more shipping companies in our days uh

1750
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,520
put that in an outsourced approach

1751
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,720
mainly using a security operation center

1752
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,198
as a service that includes incident

1753
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,759
response capabilities and capacity of

1754
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,920
course and the previous uh approach and

1755
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,799
the previous principle the detecting and

1756
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,319
respond and detected

1757
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,719
and responded also involves

1758
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,880
the engagement of a security operation

1759
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,679
center mainly outsourced either way what

1760
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,319
we need to communicate what you need to

1761
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,359
understand is that it is a priority it

1762
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,198
is important to have a 24 7 coverage

1763
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,479
that will provide to the cipic industry

1764
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,520
the right

1765
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,839
capacity and capabilities to respond to

1766
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,560
cyber attacks because

1767
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,560
it's not a

1768
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,799
protection and proactive productive

1769
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,679
measures will not sufficiently

1770
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,040
prevent

1771
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,238
cyber attacks from being happen

1772
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,679
disaster recovery and business

1773
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,679
continuity plans are

1774
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,640
plans that have their own maturity level

1775
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,960
in the maritime sector in terms of

1776
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,600
physical security

1777
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,799
we know that there are plans that

1778
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,120
provide the right measures

1779
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,080
even against piracy and so on

1780
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,040
so we need also to tailor those backup

1781
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,880
plans

1782
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,399
to

1783
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,839
perform a

1784
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,158
proper backup and restore the systems

1785
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,439
and to make sure that shipping

1786
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,399
operations can be restored

1787
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,960
when they are impacted when they have an

1788
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,679
impact by a cyber attack

1789
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,679
we need to know how the it and ot work

1790
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,080
properly and how they can be restored

1791
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,238
because the major concern in the

1792
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,120
maritime industry in maritime sector is

1793
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,159
the impact in the ot assets

1794
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,520
since

1795
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,840
any disruption there could mean

1796
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,679
quite significant damage

1797
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,159
other aspects in terms of mitigation the

1798
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,920
cyber threats

1799
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,000
are the following that include secured

1800
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,440
architecture

1801
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,280
with the key

1802
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,440
principle the network segmentation we

1803
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,760
have seen in the past

1804
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,880
that there are systems

1805
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,120
especially on board on bezels where i t

1806
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,840
and ot systems are not separated not

1807
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,239
physically separated meaning that they

1808
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,679
can provide a vulnerable path for cyber

1809
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,280
attacks to be

1810
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,480
performed

1811
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,719
so starting from that from the network

1812
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,120
segmentation a secure architecture need

1813
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,199
to be applied involving also other

1814
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,679
subnetting principles that will make

1815
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,360
sure that

1816
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,000
access is being granted only to those

1817
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,360
who have the right permissions in the

1818
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,280
right authorization

1819
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,600
strong identity and access management

1820
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,880
something really important in every er

1821
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,760
globally in the security domain

1822
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,080
so even more in the maritime sector we

1823
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,880
need the stroke authentication process

1824
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,600
for every digital asset we have seen

1825
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,640
many

1826
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,760
incidents

1827
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
especially on board from

1828
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,400
different audits where passwords

1829
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,839
were just on a stick

1830
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,280
and

1831
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,640
passwords with a common accounts with a

1832
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,880
common password and other very poor of

1833
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,600
education systems and that's why in a

1834
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,400
recent guideline from

1835
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,400
us coast guard

1836
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,840
the first

1837
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,520
let's say a guide instruction was to use

1838
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,080
a password for each account i know it

1839
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,640
sounds really trivial but

1840
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,880
in 2021 because it was last year's

1841
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,280
accommodation you can imagine

1842
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,080
how

1843
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,400
often this was identified in the real

1844
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,920
world audits

1845
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,159
secure configuration every system must

1846
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,840
be configured properly to minimize the

1847
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,960
attack surface something really common

1848
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,560
really

1849
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,520
not something new but again a lot of

1850
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,159
attacks come from poor configuration

1851
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,600
from default admin consoles from default

1852
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,400
username and passwords that make

1853
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,800
uh from unnecessary services that are

1854
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,480
open to

1855
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,320
the rest of

1856
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,719
the network that make the attack surface

1857
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,400
bigger and more vulnerable to cyber

1858
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,799
attacks

1859
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,000
user awareness and training

1860
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,800
it has been mentioned before we need to

1861
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,120
train the users which are the weakest

1862
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,560
link

1863
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,719
with multiple awareness activities i

1864
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,080
know from

1865
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,880
my experience with

1866
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,600
private maritime sectors that one of the

1867
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,840
biggest concerns is how they can train

1868
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,719
the users that are on board on vessels

1869
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,000
uh given uh most of the times the poor

1870
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,960
background in handling i.t equipment

1871
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,679
it is something that requires a lot of

1872
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,440
effort and we need the multiple

1873
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,440
awareness activities those just trivial

1874
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,480
videos

1875
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,760
and

1876
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,040
10

1877
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,199
instructions of how to use the digital

1878
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,320
assets

1879
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,520
we need facing pains we need many more

1880
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,440
to train the users

1881
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,560
to identify potential threat also what

1882
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,640
has been also identified is not only the

1883
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,480
size the maritime sector that is

1884
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,880
suffering from that the entire security

1885
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,199
community offer suffers

1886
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,000
from the lack of cyber secure expertise

1887
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,480
even more in maritime sector there is a

1888
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,960
misconception that

1889
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,159
security is part of the overall i.t

1890
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,239
management

1891
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:47,520
so it is very often uh

1892
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,440
that we find

1893
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,560
a security cybersecurity in maritime as

1894
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,880
a part of it which is something actually

1895
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,719
that used to happen

1896
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,520
in

1897
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,480
other

1898
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,600
areas

1899
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,960
as well in the past however we need also

1900
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,679
to

1901
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,480
explicitly address

1902
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,679
that and

1903
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,000
shipping companies would start involving

1904
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,880
and hiring cyber security experts that

1905
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,840
will

1906
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,679
fill and address the

1907
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,360
security gaps

1908
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,520
last but not least is

1909
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,440
what we call the security compliance and

1910
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,719
regulations

1911
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:23,520
uh

1912
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,600
you referred briefly before

1913
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,440
how imo and

1914
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,880
regulations can help

1915
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,120
imo has started in 2017 with the

1916
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,960
guidelines of maritime cyber risk

1917
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,560
management

1918
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,239
bimcore released the guidelines on cyber

1919
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,280
security on board ships both guidelines

1920
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,239
and imo used and still use as a

1921
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,040
reference the iso

1922
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,360
27001 standard in the nist framework

1923
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,199
and

1924
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,120
the main

1925
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,520
concept and the main recommendation back

1926
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,400
then was for the shipping company the

1927
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,560
civic industry receiving owners to

1928
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,120
develop a cyber security plan

1929
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,080
that actually drove to a situation that

1930
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,320
they can share with you at least for the

1931
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,239
last two years

1932
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,480
that most of the times part of the audit

1933
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,120
and part of what can be could be

1934
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,840
considered as a successful cyber risk

1935
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,920
management

1936
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,800
approach was for each vessel to have a

1937
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,280
cyber security manual

1938
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,560
a manual that included

1939
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,280
the guidelines that imo offered

1940
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,199
a cyber

1941
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,840
risk assessment the risk treatment plan

1942
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,080
some recommendations security controls

1943
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,199
but only them only those were on the

1944
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,000
manual nothing was implemented in real

1945
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,360
time and until recently those

1946
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,280
this was a

1947
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,600
conceived considered by the auditing

1948
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,080
authorities as something sufficient for

1949
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,440
a vessel to be cyber security compliance

1950
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,159
so my point is that yes regulations need

1951
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,360
to be there

1952
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,520
shipping interest in maritime sector is

1953
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,320
very sensitive to regulations this is

1954
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,400
what has been

1955
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,760
seen in the past for other areas however

1956
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,400
compliance doesn't mean security we need

1957
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,480
to be compliant with the instructions

1958
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,640
regulations are there but we have to

1959
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,600
realize that needs that those need to be

1960
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,640
more than a cyber security manual need

1961
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,400
to be implemented

1962
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,880
and applied security controls that will

1963
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,199
really make sense on

1964
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,239
mitigating the cyber threats

1965
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,920
and the impact

1966
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,719
from

1967
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,560
in the maritime

1968
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,080
community

1969
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,679
and that actually concludes my

1970
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,400
presentation

1971
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,880
i hope that

1972
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,760
you helped me well despite the distance

1973
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,000
thank you very much uh for your

1974
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,760
excellent presentation

1975
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,800
is doros uh i would like to ask

1976
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,600
or

1977
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,080
audience if there is any question

1978
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,280
yes there is please

1979
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:08,880
thank you

1980
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,960
my name is luke helleborg and first of

1981
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,840
all i was very astonished surprised

1982
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,199
that

1983
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,880
i saw the anissa study for 2011. i was

1984
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,320
doing the study with deloitte at that

1985
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,120
time and i'm so surprised that still

1986
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,560
those

1987
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,640
points are not all addressed yet so

1988
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,880
thank you michael for bringing them up

1989
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,600
now my question to eda is the next it's

1990
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,960
about user awareness and training

1991
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,560
i hear a lot we need and we should do

1992
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,840
and sometimes in mankind we always need

1993
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,840
a very big

1994
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,360
catastrophe if something really needs to

1995
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,040
start moving on on the terrain

1996
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,920
so my question was about this

1997
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,040
training of people

1998
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,679
is there an existing

1999
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,320
training maritime center already exists

2000
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,080
ongoing or planned

2001
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,120
where people could go on the operational

2002
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,360
level and tactical level to really train

2003
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,560
hands-on

2004
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,239
how to secure

2005
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,400
maritime cyber

2006
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,640
in a very practical way we heard today

2007
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,239
technology is there

2008
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,679
processes are there we have capabilities

2009
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,480
so my question is is it existing and if

2010
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,000
not

2011
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,480
if we should propose from industry

2012
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,760
a maritime tactical training capability

2013
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,400
yeah for europe would european defense

2014
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,559
agencies support us thank you very much

2015
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,719
thank you for the question

2016
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,480
i know that uh for nato exists that

2017
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,800
that's a maritime specific training

2018
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,880
center and actually it is increased in

2019
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,920
greece

2020
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,239
but the european union as far as i know

2021
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,080
and the focus on defense there's not

2022
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,280
something similar to that

2023
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,840
eda of course can support such

2024
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,560
initiatives and

2025
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,040
based on how we work in terms of

2026
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,480
facilitating and enabling

2027
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,239
research and technology innovation

2028
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,280
activity is bringing to their networking

2029
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,199
and the acting as an interface between

2030
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,400
industry academia rto and ministries of

2031
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,600
defence

2032
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,080
it is always there's always an

2033
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,000
opportunity and room for

2034
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,560
further improvements and invest that so

2035
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,679
yes it

2036
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,360
can support that

2037
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,040
i know that there's not any european

2038
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,840
union defense for maritime sector a

2039
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,199
specific training center and

2040
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,159
you are more than welcome to provide

2041
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,320
recommendations from the ideas on that

2042
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,400
thank you

2043
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
thank you very much

2044
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,280
any other question

2045
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,199
not yet

2046
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,400
well uh

2047
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
i was just considering uh

2048
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,080
recommendations recommendations

2049
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,640
recommendations that's nice but uh i

2050
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,679
don't know uh if the if the industry

2051
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:04,400
follows it or not most probably yes it

2052
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,600
does

2053
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,400
but

2054
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,920
is there a

2055
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,360
participant in the industry who offers

2056
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,679
a platform or a framework

2057
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,480
that can be used by any participant of

2058
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,120
the industry to join the forces and

2059
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,519
fight together against the cyberattacks

2060
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,480
is the question for me yes

2061
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,080
yeah

2062
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,719
as far as i know uh

2063
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,440
no there's not such a kind of

2064
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,120
of a platform that can be used for

2065
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,840
everyone of course commercial solutions

2066
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,120
are there

2067
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,280
we know that big

2068
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,480
companies uh i don't want to name one or

2069
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,400
two i don't know what to be considered

2070
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,480
as a promoting specific private sector

2071
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,639
but there are solutions that actually

2072
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,199
integrate uh the

2073
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,880
let's say traditional cybersecurity uh

2074
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,880
solutions into a more tailored

2075
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,480
environment that could

2076
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,800
function and work in vessels we have

2077
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,080
seen solutions that try to do that

2078
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,760
however there's not something that can

2079
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,400
be used as the golden should learn and

2080
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,960
confirm that yes

2081
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,040
we need to do that or we need that

2082
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,560
platform that is applicable

2083
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,679
and certified at some point for use in

2084
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,920
the septic industry

2085
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,360
for visuals and for part-time

2086
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,719
assets

2087
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,320
make sense

2088
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,960
i think so

2089
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,840
thank

2090
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,480
you

2091
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,920
the the question of education uh popped

2092
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,560
up uh several times uh

2093
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,360
professor katsika sir i think that

2094
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,639
norway is

2095
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,360
very advanced in the in the topic how do

2096
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,199
you feel how could we introduce an um

2097
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,639
education system for seafarers

2098
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,199
uh related to the cyber

2099
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,679
issues we i don't think that we can

2100
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:08,960
teach

2101
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,760
hundred thousands of of uh

2102
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,719
guys

2103
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,239
for everything

2104
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,480
no that that would not that would not be

2105
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,320
feasible and i don't think it is needed

2106
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,960
anyway because this is the kind of

2107
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,120
well let me take it from another angle

2108
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,600
you know when you speak about human

2109
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,880
cognition

2110
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,840
usually we identify three uh three

2111
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,719
levels in the knowledge continuum you

2112
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,280
start with awareness right

2113
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,440
of being which means being able to

2114
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
answer questions like what is this about

2115
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,960
right

2116
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,920
then

2117
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,639
you go on with training

2118
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,960
and when you're trained you're able to

2119
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,120
answer questions of the type how do you

2120
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,239
do this

2121
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,920
and then the third level in the

2122
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,560
knowledge continuum is education

2123
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,639
uh after which when you're educated

2124
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,320
you're supposed to be able to answer

2125
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,800
questions of the type why

2126
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,199
now we don't need really

2127
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,280
so many thousands or hundred thousands

2128
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,560
of people that are

2129
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,199
educated in maritime cybersecurity but

2130
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,400
we do need

2131
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,120
trained personnel and we most of all

2132
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,719
need aware

2133
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,679
personnel now how can this uh how can

2134
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,880
this be done well one way is

2135
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,560
by

2136
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,760
inviting

2137
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,480
the industry because this is not really

2138
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,440
only a state responsibility to build up

2139
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,639
training

2140
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,000
and awareness

2141
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,159
it's mostly training centers for their

2142
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,320
staff in the maritime industry

2143
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,520
uh isidoro's already mentioned one such

2144
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,040
which i believe is of military

2145
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,560
orientation

2146
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,800
in crete actually

2147
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,000
but

2148
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,320
such initiatives would be welcomed from

2149
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,000
industry and in fact

2150
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,639
i do remember an initiative

2151
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,440
back in 2017

2152
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,679
so it was the beginning for the cyber

2153
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,440
security

2154
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,639
issues in maritime when such a training

2155
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,199
center was announced as a joint

2156
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:08,159
initiative between the tacos lines in

2157
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,440
greece

2158
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,400
and

2159
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,000
a major norwegian

2160
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,040
industry

2161
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,120
actually with presence in many nations i

2162
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,719
will not name them of course but you

2163
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,800
might guess what it is

2164
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,880
that they would start a training

2165
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,880
center for cyber security but

2166
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,360
unfortunately this didn't didn't didn't

2167
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,040
fly but this is one way of doing it now

2168
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,040
if you move a bit

2169
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,679
in the knowledge continuum and you go up

2170
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,560
to education well i guess the the way to

2171
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,440
do it

2172
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,400
is to introduce

2173
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,120
cybersecurity

2174
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,199
course or courses

2175
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,800
to those studying marine technology or

2176
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,920
marine operations so in the

2177
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,360
ntnu

2178
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,960
setting

2179
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,639
we would have to

2180
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,520
somehow introduce courses uh of cyber

2181
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,880
security into our the curricula taught

2182
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,560
in our olasund campus where the maritime

2183
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,280
maritime industry is

2184
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,120
that would be one way to do it and of

2185
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,320
course to a lesser extent

2186
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,159
in size i mean

2187
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:19,679
inform the curriculum uh in my own

2188
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,360
department which is on information

2189
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,400
security

2190
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,080
on

2191
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,560
matters of cyber security in maritime

2192
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,239
but that would have to be

2193
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,719
on on a different scale and much less

2194
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,159
because obviously they would have to be

2195
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,159
exposed not only to the maritime

2196
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,400
industry but also to transportation

2197
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,560
industry and to

2198
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,120
power industry and to any type of of

2199
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,159
industry

2200
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,560
you could imagine but i think

2201
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,239
well i don't think i know at least in

2202
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:47,600
norway

2203
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,679
there is a great demand

2204
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,000
for master's programs

2205
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
that will

2206
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,840
produce people that are knowledgeable in

2207
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,800
both i.t and ot cyber security

2208
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,840
and

2209
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,560
yeah that's something i believe

2210
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,840
that

2211
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,480
us as educators will have to pay

2212
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,600
attention to is

2213
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,600
thank you very much mike is the

2214
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,280
curriculum in the states for seafarers

2215
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:20,080
contains some cyber related education

2216
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,840
there

2217
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,280
are a couple of ways to approach this

2218
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,040
from the

2219
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,320
from the military aspect of course

2220
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,840
you've got the naval academy navy rotc

2221
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,600
uh programs

2222
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,159
officer training contained within public

2223
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,920
universities

2224
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,120
and the naval and the coast guard

2225
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,719
academy

2226
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,760
merchant marine academy as well

2227
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,080
how we go back and

2228
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,639
recapture

2229
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,800
the people that already have

2230
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,639
um

2231
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,920
the creds that are working in the

2232
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,040
industry to get them spun up uh that

2233
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,480
that's a great question and i'm not i'm

2234
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,320
not sure how we would approach that or

2235
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,760
even how we would incentivize it

2236
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,639
so

2237
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,719
see thank you uh i think uh

2238
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,080
do you have any questions for the

2239
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,840
question

2240
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,760
so thank you very much

2241
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,639
for

2242
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,600
our speakers for the contribution

2243
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,880
i think

2244
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,960
we see the problems we saw uh

2245
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,880
several possible

2246
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,040
scenarios that can happen

2247
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,000
in the case of uh

2248
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,280
in a case and we

2249
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,639
saw that

2250
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:33,600
there are

2251
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,159
a way how to solve the problems

2252
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:39,120
and i hope and believe that uh

2253
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,920
we

2254
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,159
it was not an accident that we ended up

2255
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,080
at the education

2256
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,440
i think

2257
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,719
i'm sure that the weakest link always

2258
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:49,760
the

2259
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,800
the

2260
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,000
personal

2261
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,880
and we can harden this weakest link with

2262
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,760
education for sure

2263
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,719
i don't know you might not not might all

2264
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,880
of you from the maritime sector and the

2265
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,600
there was a slight sma smile

2266
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,679
when the password management was

2267
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,320
mentioned let me comment with this short

2268
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,960
story i was dealing with uh with the

2269
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,520

estonian keyboard um on the workshop

2271
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,440
they can feel my pain so i i mistyped

2272
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,320
the password obviously so i contacted

2273
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
the vendor

2274
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,560
that the password doesn't what is the

2275
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,920
password

2276
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,239
and they wrote it is in the users manual

2277
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,800
page 57

2278
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,960
page 57 password is there cool

2279
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,080
remark

please

2281
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,440
don't change this password

2282
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,000
because in the case of need or experts

2283
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,560

2284
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,800
good

2285
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,560
so i tried to finish my job but i failed

2286
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,480
so i sent a letter

2287
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,120
to the vendor hey the password is wrong

2288
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,199
okay try this one

2289
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,840
super admin password

2290
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,280
opens everything so i think

2291
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,480
it was a it was a good case study to

2292

show that uh

2293
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,360
