1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,680
hi

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,560
thank you for coming back after lunch to

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
end this panel on the perils and promise

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
of emerging technologies

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,759
and today we've got a really really

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
great panel of four presenters and we'll

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
we have um leonid mashmayer

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
from the he's a senior researcher at the

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,880
center of securities at east j zurich

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
then we will have um miguel alberto

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,119
gomez who's also a senior researcher at

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,920
the center for securities ach zurich

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,719
kim hardman who is the

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,239
cyber and information technology

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
director of the site of the conflict um

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,800
studies research center in the uk

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
and we have online um

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,840
christopher white who is an assistant

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,239
professor at virginia commonwealth

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
university in the usa

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
so

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,039
firstly we'll have um lenovo who is

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,879
going to be presenting

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,680
on

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
subverting skynet the strategic promise

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,119
of lethal autonomous weapon systems and

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,680
the perils of exploitation so please

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,000
take it away

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,799
okay

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,479
hi everyone

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,600
all right

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,119
um

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,799
nice to meet you all

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,240
my name is sir marshmeyer i don't think

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
i have to introduce myself again

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
the talk i'm to give today is really

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,200
exploratory it's a topic that i'm

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
planning to work more on in the future

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
in the past i've really focused on

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
subversion and the subversive nature of

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
cyber operations

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
and the limitations it has strategically

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,479
so

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
today i'm looking into this new emerging

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
technology artificial intelligence

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,320
lethal autonomous weapon system their

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
great strategic promise

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
but also the the perils obviously that

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
exist here from exploiting them that i

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
think have not been

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,119
acknowledged enough so far in the debate

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,320
so

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
a quick overview of what i'll be talking

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,079
about so i'll start with the strategic

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,200
promise

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,840
what are the expectations of these

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,758
weapons then the limitations and the

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
challenges that we already know in their

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
use

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
third and mainly i'll talk about the

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
perils of subversion

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,599
and the risks that follow from it and to

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,599
show why our focus on or i'll draw on

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,319
existing research from computer science

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
and the types of vulnerabilities that we

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,160
already know exist

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
and finally i'll talk about the

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
strategic implications that follow from

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
these vulnerabilities and what you can

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
do with them

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,519
so

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
starting point for this are at least

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
what are laws what are lethal autonomous

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
weapons systems

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
and at the basic level they're really

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
just what their name suggests weapon

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
systems that can kill people operate

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
autonomously

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,239
the usdod defines them as a weapon

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
system that once activated can select

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
and engage targets without further

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,360
intervention by a human operator

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
and these features are enabled by

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
advancements in two main fields of

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,920
research as i said this technology

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,560
doesn't exist yet but we do know on

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
based on what technologies it would be

88
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,800
possible to field such units

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
and this is robotics and artificial

90
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
intelligence and especially machine

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,519
learning

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
so robots are getting better and better

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
at navigating tehran and also simulating

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
complex human emotions

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,720
and

96
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,080
this is because machine learning

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
algorithms have made great advances

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
especially in the field of deep learning

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
utilizing complex neural networks that

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
partially emulate the structure of the

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
human brain but operate differently in

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
ways that are quite important for this

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
potential of exploitation so i'll talk

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
about that in a

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,519
minute now such neural networks are

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,120
already capable of

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
prevailing against top human players in

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
complex strategy games that involve

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
uncertainty fog of war on the

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
battlefield

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
so this is a little animation from

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
deepmind's alpha star ai that defeated a

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,239
world champion player in the strategy

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,159
game starcraft 2.

115
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,640
and we also have started putting weapons

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
we being us human beings on some of

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
these advanced robots

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,959
and i would argue it's only a question

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
of when not if

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
such armed robots will be fused with

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
artificial intelligence

122
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,960
enabling them to operate autonomously

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
it's unlikely i would argue they're

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
going to look like the terminator from

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
the movies

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
but it is

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
likely they will have the capability to

128
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
kill and destroy

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
and i argue that it's a question of

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
when not if

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,759
because of the great strategic promise

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,320
that you have by developing and filling

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
these units so vladimir putin has said

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
whoever becomes the leader in the sphere

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
will become the ruler of the world

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
other speaker of a third revolution in

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,320
warfare because these units can move

138
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,639
much faster than human beings

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
and also can be deployed at such scale

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
they enable military superior

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
superiority

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
the bigger

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
promise though that's worth to keep in

144
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
mind is this idea of a bloodless war of

145
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
a casualty-free

146
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
conflict and the one author has called

147
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
it the quest for the bloodless war

148
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,639
so obviously huge opportunities here

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,160
but towards reaching them they're

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
already known

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
limitations

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
one of them being the difference between

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,039
information processing and decision

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
making that avi goldferb and john

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
lindsey have recently published a great

156
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
paper on where we know that

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
neural networks different machine

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
learning algorithms are very good at

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
information processing and much faster

160
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,639
than humans

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
but that's not the case for complex

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
decision making especially all the

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,919
components that human decision making

164
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,039
involves

165
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,039
and the counterintuitive consequence

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,080
being that

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
humans possibly have to play an even

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
greater role when such units are fielded

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,639
the second

170
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
challenge is loyalty and trust in human

171
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
machine interaction

172
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
biggest question here being under what

173
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
conditions can human soldiers be

174
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,880
expected to rely with trust their lives

175
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
on you know their machine comrades

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
and this is a big problem because also

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
ai is a black box you know deep learning

178
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
neural networks are black box algorithms

179
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,440
where you don't really know how the

180
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
information is processed how the output

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,440
is generated so you have this

182
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,639
unpredictability there

183
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
and finally the biggest one possibly is

184
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,120
the ethical questions there's a basic

185
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
one should we build killer robots

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
which uh yeah contentious debate that's

187
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
already going but there are also

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
more nuanced question here being you

189
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
know under what conditions can they be

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
released to kill what kinds of targets

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,560
and how autonomously obviously

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
so building on this

193
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
the question i want to focus on though

194
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
is so these limitations exist even if

195
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,800
this technology works the way it's

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
designed and intended to work but what

197
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
if it doesn't that's i think a possibly

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
even bigger problem and that leads to

199
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
the perils of subversion as i framed it

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
since as i mentioned that's been my

201
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
research so far

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
so i focused on the potential for

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
subverting information technology

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
through cyber operations and what the

205
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,000
strategic value is

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
i found actually several limitations

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
there that i think have been

208
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,039
underappreciated

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,280
but the basic point i want to stress is

210
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,960
that information technology can be

211
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
subverted this is something that's

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
inherent to the technology

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
because it's based on logical algorithms

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
and routines that determine its behavior

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and because these algorithms and

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,479
routines are developed by human beings

217
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
who are fundamentally fallible

218
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,479
they always contain flaws that enable

219
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,280
exploitation and manipulation

220
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
and the same applies to laws who also

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
build on algorithms there are much more

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
complex different kinds of algorithms

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
neural networks but

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
this situation and the vulnerabilities

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
that follow still apply here

226
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
and there are three major types of

227
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
vulnerabilities and paths to

228
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,960
exploitation that follow from existing

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
research and computer science the first

230
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
one is development compromise

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
which basically means

232
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
having someone infiltrate

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
or the classic way would be an agent who

234
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,800
infiltrates the institution involved

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,599
here

236
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,400
and builds a backdoor of some kind or

237
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,240
otherwise compromises the neural network

238
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
in question so i should say i'm focusing

239
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,080
on neural networks because these are the

240
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
most likely candidates for

241
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,840
algorithms that would drive these

242
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
autonomous weapon systems they are based

243
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
on what we know now most capable of this

244
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
level of autonomy needed right so for

245
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
example a backdoor can be implemented

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
that is activated by a specific trigger

247
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
and upon countering that

248
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
trigger the algorithm that's trying to

249
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
recognize cars so this is an existing

250
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,679
experiment

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,320
that previously worked flawlessly

252
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
suddenly starts identifying cars as

253
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,519
birds

254
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
so this trigger can be a humanly

255
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
identifiable symbol like in this example

256
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
here from another research project

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
but it might also be a pattern or a

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
sound that's invisible and inaudible to

259
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,880
humans and therefore not easily

260
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
detectable

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
and if we put this to the topic of

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
autonomous weapon systems right what if

263
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
there is a trigger that activates a

264
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
vector that turns your units against

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
yourself

266
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
after they've been perfectly loyal

267
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
before

268
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,959
clearly a problem

269
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
the second type of vulnerability and

270
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
path of exploitation is by poisoning the

271
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
data that's used to train neural

272
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,120
networks

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,399
so this means

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,080
you need access to that data and the

275
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
previous one you obviously need access

276
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
to the institution organization that's

277
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,279
involved in the development process

278
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
itself here it's a lower threshold for

279
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
that excess

280
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,240
and one way that has already been proven

281
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
in research is by introducing a pattern

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
known as a perturbance that might not be

283
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
visible to the human eye so you see that

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
on the middle image here yet it is

285
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
visible to the algorithm it creates a

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
statistical correlation and then leads

287
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
to misclassification of data for example

288
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
a panda as a

289
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
api i think

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
and that way

291
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
neural networks can be manipulated to

292
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
misidentify

293
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
rifles as turtles and vice versa another

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
demonstrated exploitation i think the

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
implications for autonomous weapons are

296
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
obvious here because they would need to

297
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,079
reliably identify enemy armed forces and

298
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
distinguish them from zookeepers as well

299
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
right

300
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,440
third type of exploitation

301
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
requires neither access to the

302
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,480
development process or to the data used

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
but rather only to the environment that

304
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
these targeted laws operate in

305
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
so research shows that simple

306
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
manipulations of objects

307
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
can manipulate complex neural networks

308
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
such as tesla's autopilot

309
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
for example to misread a 35 miles per

310
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
hour sign where you see the the middle

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,279
part is just slightly elongated here and

312
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,640
read this as a 85 miles per hour sign

313
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,440
it's a bit small but at least you see it

314
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
on the screen here

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,519
the tesla autopilot reliably reads this

316
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
as 85 miles per hours

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
and again implications for laws are

318
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,640
quite obvious just consider soldiers

319
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
with slightly manipulated uniforms that

320
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
make enemy laws recognize them as

321
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,519
friends

322
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
and i focus here really on the visual

323
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
part visual recognition pattern

324
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,959
recognition because that's really where

325
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
most of this research is at

326
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
but especially when it goes into

327
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
decision making we can imagine a lot of

328
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
scenarios you know where you can build

329
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,519
in

330
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,880
exploits to really affect the

331
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
decision-making process itself

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
so what are the strategic implications

333
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,279
the first one is the the main challenge

334
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,000
here is uncertainty because

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,839
these

336
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,040
uh as i said there are black box

337
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
algorithms so that means you can't

338
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
really run an audit of code in a way

339
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
that's possible the traditional software

340
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
so that means there is a fundamental

341
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
uncertainty fielding such units based on

342
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
everything we know at least whether you

343
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
can rely on them whether they're going

344
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
to behave as expected or not

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
and the second problem and the risk that

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
follows from this is that of systemic

347
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
subversion because so if there is a

348
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
vulnerability like this you can exploit

349
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
like the ones i've just

350
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
laid out

351
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,839
it wouldn't affect just one unit but

352
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
possibly an entire class of units and

353
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
that would mean you know you have this

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
entire class of units suddenly

355
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,600
stopping to work as you think or turning

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
against you it's a significant problem i

357
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
don't i don't need to underline why

358
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
and the really underlying problem is

359
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
that these vulnerabilities are inherent

360
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
to the technology itself and that's

361
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,880
something that yesterday came up in the

362
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
talk if you've seen that from pitaris

363
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,680
so far and the way that these systems

364
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,279
these algorithms work and the way they

365
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,880
need to be trained there is no way to

366
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,279
reliably eliminate these vulnerabilities

367
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
so someone commented to me on the draft

368
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,320
of this paper that it would be naive to

369
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
expect that militaries are going to

370
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
field these kinds of units without

371
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
eliminating these vulnerabilities but

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
ironically that is a very naive

373
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
expectation because there is no known

374
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
technical fix and there is also no known

375
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,959
fix by you know further development

376
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,440
that's really important to underline and

377
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
because there is no technical fix the

378
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
solution has to be strategic

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,279
and here i'll just lay out three

380
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,120
possible strategies and the problems

381
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
that arise from them

382
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
in dealing with this problem the first

383
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,440
one is just classic counterintelligence

384
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
meaning traditional counterintelligence

385
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,959
tradecraft such as identifying

386
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
infiltrating agents this particularly

387
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
relevant for development compromises but

388
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
might also involve monitoring adversary

389
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,240
activity predicting what they're doing

390
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
second type of a second strategy will

391
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
really focus on technical detection

392
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,040
so i mentioned it's not possible to

393
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,279
audit code and look at the network

394
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,360
itself the algorithm find out whether

395
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
it's been compromised but it has been

396
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
shown by some researchers that is

397
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
possible to measure output data and

398
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
through statistical analysis identify

399
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,519
different kinds of anomalies but that

400
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
also important to underline it gives you

401
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
a probability of compromise but it's in

402
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
reality the real

403
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
reliability still remains unclear and

404
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
that means there is still uncertainty i

405
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
mean a low risk of catastrophic failure

406
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
is still not something you want to deal

407
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
with you know when you feel these kinds

408
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
of units

409
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
therefore the third strategy addresses

410
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
the consequences of that uncertainty

411
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,839
which cannot really be eliminated by

412
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
either of the

413
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
two mentioned before

414
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,800
and that would really be either limiting

415
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,279
the potential damage of compromises the

416
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,160
obvious way would be to limit deployment

417
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
of the of loss to a few specific tasks

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
and also always in the minority of uh

419
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,959
compared to human

420
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
human units

421
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
and basing on this following from this

422
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
the more extreme solution would be what

423
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
i'd call a luddite option whereby

424
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
superior firepower always remains in

425
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,600
human hands

426
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
and that makes it possible keeps the

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
option open to neutralize marauding

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
rogue laws if they you know start to

429
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
maraud on the battlefield just in case

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,560
however

431
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,399
and of course these strategies limit the

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
key advantages of deploying deploying

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
laws namely the ability to overwhelm

434
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
opponents with swarms of fast acting and

435
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,959
reacting machines

436
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,560
and then also and this applies

437
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
especially to the luddite option i just

438
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
laid out the potential to limit

439
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
casualties because you would have you

440
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
know human soldiers fighting basically

441
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
these machines

442
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
so in conclusion

443
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
first point i really want to stress is

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that policy makers and defense planners

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
have to accept that laws are inherently

446
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
vulnerable based on everything that we

447
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,720
know there is no technical fix

448
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
however the vast strategic promise makes

449
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
their deployment likely nonetheless

450
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
based on what we know about

451
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,800
self-interest especially

452
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,240
meanwhile the feasible strategic

453
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
solutions i've laid out they limit or

454
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,120
even forfeit the key advantages of these

455
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
laws that means they are less likely to

456
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,959
be used as well because they you know

457
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,639
have sub-optimal solutions to the

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
problem so the most likely scenario is

459
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
that they're going to be vulnerable laws

460
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
deployed at scale at some stage possibly

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,279
not that far in the future

462
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,279
leading to a lot of problems which i

463
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
plan to look more into in over the next

464
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,680
years i think one thing i want to close

465
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
with here is as i said my research has

466
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
focused on the limitations of cyber

467
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
operations the challenges of subverting

468
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
information technology

469
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
and the limited strategic value

470
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
especially in producing destruction and

471
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,079
damage but this is flipped around

472
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,079
potentially in this situation where it

473
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,839
might be extremely challenging to

474
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
subvert these units

475
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,360
but the damage that you can cause by

476
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
doing so is so great the strategic value

477
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,279
can derive is so great that it's worth

478
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,000
to invest huge resources into this and

479
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
ultimately this development might be

480
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
what brings us a real cyber war that you

481
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
know people have warned of for a long

482
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
time

483
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,360
thank you i hope you found it

484
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
interesting i look forward to your

485
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,519
questions and comments later

486
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
thank you very much lynn and i just a

487
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
quick question based on um what you've

488
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
just said is that well maybe strategic

489
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,560
adversaries will deploy this and you

490
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,959
mentioned about the speed of deployment

491
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,760
how might we respond to

492
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
the speed of that interaction can there

493
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
be human machine teaming in that sort of

494
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,839
situation

495
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
well i think that's at the heart of the

496
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
problem right if you want to react to it

497
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
you have to take humans out of the loop

498
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
but that brings all these problems with

499
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
it and whereas if you keep humans in the

500
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
loop you have more reliability more

501
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760
predictability

502
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
but you lose the speed advantage

503
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
and that's going to be a fundamental

504
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
question to solve for strategic planners

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
i'm glad i'm not the one that needs to

506
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
do this

507
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,039
great well what we'll do is we'll move

508
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,160
on to our next um speaker who is um

509
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
miguel alberto gomez and he's going to

510
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
be speaking about third-party countries

511
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
in cyber conflict understanding the

512
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
dynamics of public opinion following

513
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,000
offensive cyber operations

514
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
all right

515
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,200
all right so

516
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
a slight detour in terms of how we

517
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
study cyber security when it comes to

518
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
this presentation so a lot of the

519
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
discussion that we've had over the last

520
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,600
two days here and in fact over the last

521
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,280
20 years or so has focused primarily on

522
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
whether or not cyber operations work

523
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
whether it achieves the desired um

524
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,039
tactical and strategic effects

525
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,840
um

526
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,919
well that is indeed a valid point to

527
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,039
answer especially given the amount of

528
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,360
investment that a lot of states have

529
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
been pouring into

530
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,840
this domain over the last few years

531
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,320
it i find it odd that one question

532
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
that's rarely answered or rarely asked

533
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
actually

534
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
is to what extent

535
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
do this public opinion play a role when

536
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
it comes to perceiving

537
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
cyber operations and effects and broadly

538
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,799
this speaks to

539
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
my wider research area which is decision

540
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,000
making in cyberspace or how humans

541
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,520
who if you think about it are the

542
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
fundamental actors um in cyberspace so

543
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,840
ultimately they are enabled by

544
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,360
technology by the end of the day it's

545
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,679
the decision of these individuals to act

546
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
that determines uh political and

547
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
strategic effects so

548
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
this

549
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
presentation that i have now speaks to

550
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,600
that question and positions itself in

551
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
a lot of the emergent literature that

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
we've been seeing over the last

553
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,400
uh five years when it comes to research

554
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
on decision making so a lot of

555
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
my colleagues have started to answer or

556
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
ask particular questions of how does the

557
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,120
public

558
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
see or perceive attribution do they buy

559
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
into attribution

560
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
or does the public have a particular way

561
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,360
of perceiving threats from cyberspace

562
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
and equal and related to this would they

563
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,720
support on retaliation through this

564
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
domain and

565
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
these are all equally important

566
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
questions because we always are the

567
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
the media and popular media in

568
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,000
particular portrays this notion of cyber

569
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,280
operations being some catastrophic event

570
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,000
that would scare publics into into

571
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,799
action or into submission in certain

572
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,720
depending on which argument you side

573
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,799
with um and what we find is that the

574
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
reality is actually a lot more nuanced

575
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
than that

576
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
public perception public opinion about

577
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
cyber

578
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
tends to

579
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,360
vary across a number of different

580
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
variables ranging from their own

581
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,559
expertise

582
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
about cyberspace to underlying beliefs

583
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,240
about a particular

584
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,360
adversary and whatnot but what's lacking

585
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,880
still in this discussion is

586
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
how about third parties how about third

587
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,760
party publics how would they respond and

588
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
this is an important question to raise

589
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,039
because as

590
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,240
state strategies in cyberspace begin to

591
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
evolve and take the case of defend

592
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
forward in the concept of persistent

593
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
engagement with the united states

594
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
this idea that you they will pursue

595
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,600
adversaries wherever they find them

596
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,480
increases the risk of spill over

597
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
cyberspace is an interconnected domain

598
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
where actions in one area could easily

599
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
carry over into another part of the

600
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
network intentionally or otherwise so

601
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,799
it's a question that's not particularly

602
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,799
new in cyber in

603
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,159
international relations political

604
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,120
science

605
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
circles um

606
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,679
the rise of terrorism during the second

607
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,799
half of the 20th century and especially

608
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
the global war on terror

609
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
saw the tendency of states of acting

610
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,080
beyond their own territories and acting

611
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,240
operating within third-party country uh

612
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
territories in order to pursue their

613
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
security goals now

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
the same could be said with cyber um

615
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
your adversary will not be launching

616
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
operations exclusively from their own

617
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
systems they could be launching it

618
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
through compromised third-party systems

619
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,880
now

620
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
if you're trying to secure yourself uh

621
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
as best as possible then you will try to

622
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
hit back where you can

623
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
of course the big question there is that

624
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,679
if your actions have been discovered by

625
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,120
the publics in these third-party

626
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
countries how do they react

627
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
the simple question is at the moment

628
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,679
we're not sure and we don't have

629
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
a definite case that we can say that yes

630
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
this is how they will react or they'll

631
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
be fine with it because we're working on

632
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,559
to to protect them and whatnot so it's

633
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,960
this type of questions that we need to

634
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
answer now especially since operations

635
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
are exten are extending way beyond uh

636
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
blue space and into grey space of both

637
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,840
both allies and non-allied states

638
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
um the study that are representing here

639
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,559
is actually just part of a larger

640
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
project but we make three

641
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,120
key arguments or

642
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,919
that we feel could affect how the

643
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
publics respond so first is the

644
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
existence of prior authorization so

645
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
whether or not the initiating state

646
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,400
would quote unquote ask permission

647
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,039
before it pursues um their adversary in

648
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,799
a third party network

649
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
we feel that that could

650
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,559
the presence of that could increase or

651
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,640
decrease um

652
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
how publics respond whether they

653
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
are fine with such an operations or they

654
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
would want to punish the initiator if

655
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
they did not ask permission first

656
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
the second factor that we're looking at

657
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,840
is the current relationship between

658
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
the initiating state and the third party

659
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
state are they allies are their partners

660
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,640
or do they not have any existing

661
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
strategic relationship at all

662
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
if your

663
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
ally decides to operate in your space

664
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,280
you might be fine with that um if you

665
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,799
assume that they're acting responsibly

666
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,240
or it could go the other way you might

667
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
not be fine with that and feel somehow

668
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
violated that someone that you trust has

669
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
been poking around in a network that's

670
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
not their own

671
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
and the final point or the final

672
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
factor that we highlight is the app is

673
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
the nature or the identity of the actual

674
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,520
target uh is the target a state actor or

675
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
is it a non-state actor and the gen

676
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,080
going into this study we felt that it is

677
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,919
possible that if it's a state after your

678
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,240
publix might be a bit more concerned

679
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
linking this back to state actors having

680
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
more capacity than than non-state actors

681
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
especially we're talking about

682
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
highly disruptive and degradative

683
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
operations in this space

684
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,520
so how do we answer this

685
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,840
in an ideal world we would wait for such

686
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
an operation

687
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,760
to occur and then release a survey

688
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
amongst publics to see how they feel

689
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,919
about it but we do not have the benefit

690
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,760
of time to do that so the next best

691
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
thing

692
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
is to run a relative relatively simple

693
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
experiment online so in our case we

694
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,200
recruited approximately 800 respondents

695
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
um in this case from the uk

696
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,080
and we presented them with a fictitious

697
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
scenario where we manipulate

698
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,919
these aspects of either authorization

699
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,240
ally existence of an alliance or the

700
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
identity of the actor and

701
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
after they've seen

702
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,799
variations of this scenario we then ask

703
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
them how willing they are to either

704
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,039
punish the initiator state

705
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,960
um continue cooperating with the initial

706
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,840
state and to what extent they feel that

707
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
this would have negative consequences

708
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,279
for them i.e blowback

709
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
and we've also

710
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,440
collected a number of

711
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
attributes as well their political views

712
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,000
etc just to see whether those would

713
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,520
influence and

714
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
i won't get too much into the details of

715
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
the findings i'll just pick i'll just

716
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,880
highlight the three most important ones

717
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
so if you're interested it's already

718
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,880
available in the proceedings of the

719
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,799
conference um but the three most

720
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,360
important findings that we we have is

721
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,559
first of all

722
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,120
punishment is not a given so

723
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,080
when we look at the likelihood of

724
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
third-party publics

725
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
calling for their government to punish

726
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
the initiator state we find that the

727
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,559
likelihood of this happening is cut in

728
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,520
half

729
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,200
if permission and if authorization

730
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,159
is uh sought and if an existing alliance

731
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,720
exists so this is an example wherein um

732
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
asking for forgiveness rather than

733
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,559
permission doesn't really work

734
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
it's a lot easier at least what we find

735
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
in this case it's a lot easier to first

736
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
ask permission than to ask for

737
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
forgiveness down the line at least as

738
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,640
far as the public is concerned now this

739
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,120
raises a couple of interesting questions

740
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
at the operational level so

741
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
if if this is indeed the case in the

742
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
initiator state must

743
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
be confident that there would be no

744
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,799
negative repercussions in their

745
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,120
capability if they were to inform the

746
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
third party that such an operation will

747
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,720
take place and

748
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
doing so still raises at this point a

749
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
lot of questions um whether that would

750
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
be a smart thing to do

751
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
um because that would somehow hint at

752
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
your capabilities which the initiator

753
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
said might not wish to be publicly known

754
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
okay so

755
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
initially so at this point the findings

756
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
already raised some interesting

757
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,360
questions um that need to be answered by

758
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
additional studies and observations down

759
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,200
the line

760
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
second finding that we have is

761
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,440
that again if authorization is sought

762
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
and if an existing alliance relationship

763
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
exists

764
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
publics are generally at least twice as

765
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
likely to favor continued cooperation um

766
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,320
so if these attributes are in place they

767
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
feel that

768
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
this might be something that they may

769
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
benefit from and would be

770
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
open to it now

771
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
the upside to this it

772
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,840
it raises the possibility that a lot of

773
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
the policies that have been

774
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,320
coming up over the last few years the

775
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
the significant

776
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,559
role that cyber plays now in existing

777
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,440
alliances this seems to reinforce this

778
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
idea that that might be a good thing

779
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,760
and then finally

780
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,080
regarding consequences we find that if

781
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
uh

782
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,279
an alliance exists

783
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
between the initiator state and the

784
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
third party state

785
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,039
the publics tend to not worry too much

786
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,039
about consequences and this is probably

787
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
the one of the most interesting findings

788
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,480
here so so long as there is a

789
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,640
relationship a strategic relationship

790
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,799
between the two

791
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,679
uh parties it is possible so we don't

792
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,960
have the definite answer for this one

793
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
but it is possible that there may be

794
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
some level of confidence amongst public

795
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,440
that what is happening would be

796
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
to their benefit and possible

797
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
consequences might be shared between um

798
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,240
them and the initiating state now

799
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
it's still quite early days for this

800
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,919
research um

801
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,640
we have a couple more follow-up uh

802
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
projects uh in in this regard we're

803
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
going to replicate this with another

804
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
country because there might be something

805
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,799
unique with the uk population their

806
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
support for such operations but

807
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,520
regardless of that it's

808
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,880
such uh

809
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
such findings are useful because it does

810
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
highlight the importance of looking

811
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
beyond

812
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,039
the question of whether or not cyber

813
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
operations makes sense it's still a

814
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,320
valuable question to

815
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,039
to raise at this point but i think as

816
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
we're starting to see the limits of

817
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,799
these operations

818
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,480
it's important for us to start to

819
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,200
analyze or start to unpack how decision

820
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
makers your policy makers and the public

821
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
alike begin to think about these

822
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
operations and what it would mean for

823
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
them

824
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,439
and with that i'll end my presentation

825
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
thanks miguel i think it's such an

826
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,960
interesting paper in particular because

827
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,039
we're starting to see how um hunts

828
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,120
forward is being done with allies in

829
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,200
particular so i'm thinking maybe we're

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
always starting to see a response to

831
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,919
some of the things that you found in

832
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,240
your paper i'm just wondering do you

833
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,039
think

834
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,720
we'll see that kind of continuing with

835
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,880
other states or where do you see it

836
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,559
going um

837
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,600
i think that um

838
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
so as i mentioned that the uk might be

839
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
an early would be a unique case um that

840
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,279
they because of the existing

841
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,480
relationship uh with with the united

842
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,919
states for instance in fact in this

843
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,200
study we actually

844
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,039
put in a question of who do you think

845
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
this operation who initiated this

846
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
operation and

847
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,600
over i think half of the respondents

848
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
noted that it was the u.s um that was

849
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,120
behind it so there might be something

850
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
that's

851
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,240
more that is that's rooted within the

852
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
existing strategic relationship between

853
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,320
these two actors that drives that which

854
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,440
is why we're going to be trying to see

855
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,399
whether or not we find the same effects

856
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,240
with other countries where we could

857
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
replicate this study but at the end of

858
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,200
the day i think the best

859
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
proof or at least the most convincing

860
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,000
proof that we would have is

861
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,880
if

862
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
we see a case wherein there is a clear

863
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
public reaction

864
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,159
uh to such an operation then that would

865
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,840
be the most instructive

866
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
for us we in the paper we highlight

867
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
operation glowing symphony the u.s

868
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,960
operation against isis that went through

869
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,559
german networks but

870
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,320
public response to that was quite muted

871
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,840
so we can't really say much out of that

872
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,399
but yeah i think over time we will see

873
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,360
more

874
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
of the dynamics of the mechanisms that

875
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,880
drive

876
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
public opinion in this regard unfold

877
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,159
great thank you very much so next we

878
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
have kim hartman and she's going to be

879
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
speaking on

880
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
the emergence of 5g networks and

881
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,640
implications for of cyber conflict and

882
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,799
this was co-written with um kier giles

883
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,200
who is a senior consulting fellow um of

884
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,799
the russian eurasia program at chatham

885
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
house who we saw on the stage in the

886
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,880
last panel and it also leads the

887
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,039
conflict studies research center thank

888
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,000
you very much thank you

889
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,519
so thank you andrew for the nice

890
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,919
introduction it's always an honor to be

891
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,399
at cycon and to get this opportunity to

892
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,519
speak here

893
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
especially as a technical speaker i'm a

894
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,320
computer scientist it's always a huge

895
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,039
chance and a challenge at the same time

896
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,039
to get the the opportunity to actually

897
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,279
speak to non-technical people as well

898
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,880
and to actually

899
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,480
show a bit of or technical world

900
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
so i know it's the first session after

901
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,640
lunch it's always a bit difficult so i

902
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
thought i just kind of start off with

903
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
being a little bit interactive with you

904
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
so as andrew just said i'm going to be

905
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,919
talking about 5g

906
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,039
and

907
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,919
our brains are kind of buzzword centered

908
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,880
so if you hear the word 5g i just want

909
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,120
to see a hand sign from you what are the

910
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
buzzwords that come to your head so

911
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,720
whenever you feel like this is a

912
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
buzzword i'm having in my head just kind

913
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,519
of raise your hand please

914
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,399
so the first thing would you say that

915
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,640
the things that you associate with 5g

916
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
networks is speed and capacity

917
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
improvements so just raise your hand

918
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,200
thank you very much okay

919
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,720
so how about smart networks

920
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,480
yeah that looks good too

921
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
iot

922
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,480
it's kind of big buzzword yes of course

923
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,320
i know it's going to be a bit biased how

924
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,519
about security concerns

925
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
yeah a little less but of course it's

926
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
going to be bias we're at cyclone so

927
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,519
obviously we all have a security focus

928
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
and of those of you who just raised your

929
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,000
hand on security concerns how many of

930
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,159
you would feel that you're capable to

931
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,880
actually pin down technically

932
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,039
where those security concerns come from

933
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,640
so just raise your hand if you feel i

934
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
know exactly where in technical terms

935
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,679
that is

936
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,919
yes okay that's what i've expected

937
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,080
that's fine that's absolutely fine now

938
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
first of all the first point that we're

939
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,960
making actually in the paper is that 5g

940
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
is it's been used as a buzzword a lot so

941
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,480
you do get the feeling okay maybe this

942
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,600
is something that i should be able to

943
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
understand easily and it's just it's

944
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
just a new way of networking it's going

945
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,600
to be faster and smart and everything

946
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
it's going to be great um if you feel

947
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,919
that you don't really understand the

948
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,960
technical

949
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,440
back backbone of it that's fine because

950
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
it's really complex i'm saying this as a

951
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,839
technical person it is complex so you

952
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,320
will need to have a background

953
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,040
best in software development as well as

954
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,119
a network infrastructure technologies to

955
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,918
actually fully grasp what is going on so

956
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,599
this is one of the things that's also a

957
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,760
challenge for most technical

958
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,879
persons

959
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,760
because it's unusual so mostly you're

960
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,839
either a network guy or you're a

961
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,280
software development guy there aren't

962
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,440
that many people around who are both so

963
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
suddenly we also we as the technical

964
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
community need to adapt to this new

965
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
challenge of 5g networks

966
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,560
so that's one of the things that we are

967
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,839
concerned with

968
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,480
but apart from that so just be calm it's

969
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
fine that if you don't feel really

970
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,440
comfortable from from the technical

971
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,560
point of view

972
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
um what i want to

973
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
or what you will be able to to say by

974
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,160
the end of this talk hopefully at least

975
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,359
is

976
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,200
where most of your security concerns

977
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,000
come from in 5g

978
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,320
who you need to place and where you need

979
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
to place those people in order to

980
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,040
mitigate these security concerns now

981
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
this sounds like a really big thing that

982
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
i'm promising and it probably is so it's

983
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,839
not gonna it's not gonna erase all your

984
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,280
problems but it's going to give you a

985
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
strategy to mitigate some of the

986
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
problems that are arising

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
so the first thing that you need to

988
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,920
understand when talking about 5g is the

989
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
big shift that we as a technical

990
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,720
community are making is to move from

991
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,920
physical devices in networking to more

992
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,480
software-based solutions so i think that

993
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
that's something that many people of you

994
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,079
will have kind of in the back of your

995
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,680
hand it has some type of she has

996
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
something to do with softwareization and

997
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
this will be familiar to you because

998
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,119
i've been with cyclone for the past 10

999
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,359
years i think and i've recognized many

1000
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,800
faces around so i know you've heard the

1001
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
same talks as i have and these topics

1002
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,800
have been up in the past so one of the

1003
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,280
things that immediately comes up is that

1004
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
you need to be concerned when you hear

1005
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
software is about software supply chain

1006
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
so that's one of the big issues that is

1007
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,040
coming in

1008
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
and obviously this also applies to 5g

1009
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,760
and even more because we're building our

1010
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
networks we're building our future

1011
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
networks everything that we're when

1012
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
we're communicating when we're talking

1013
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,200
about hospitals about production plans

1014
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,880
whatever basically you name it

1015
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
everything that we're using will be

1016
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,640
based on 5g

1017
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,119
and we need to consider that the

1018
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,680
software side of it is a huger concern

1019
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,520
than it has been in the past

1020
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,760
and it's also a huge security concern

1021
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
because in the past we have always been

1022
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
able as the final

1023
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
solution like if everything goes wrong

1024
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,440
we've always said well at least we have

1025
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
physical security yeah so if if you're

1026
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
not on my machine if you don't have

1027
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,440
physical access to it

1028
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,599
i'm fine worst case i can pull the plug

1029
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
and everything's going to be okay

1030
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,359
now with 5g

1031
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,599
you have largely deprived yourself of

1032
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
that solution

1033
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,320
so it's it's never been a good solution

1034
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
i'm not saying that but it has been a

1035
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,920
solution that has been there and you've

1036
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
deprived yourself of that at the same

1037
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,599
time

1038
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,040
5g is

1039
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
basically

1040
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,640
one of the possibilities many of the

1041
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,720
possibilities that come from 5g have

1042
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,440
actually arisen from the facts that you

1043
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
open up the way you're building your

1044
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
network you're allowing more people to

1045
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,599
contribute to how to build the network

1046
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,680
from a software side so these people are

1047
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,079
writing software so it's not you don't

1048
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,520
have to be

1049
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,200
like a physical

1050
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,079
micro or plates productor or anything

1051
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,000
you don't have to to build physical

1052
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
devices you have to build software and

1053
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
that allows you to contribute i'm not

1054
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,520
just talking about the suppliers in

1055
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
terms of the big ones but i'm actually

1056
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,079
talking about each individual developer

1057
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,680
that is included in this process

1058
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,480
so

1059
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,640
basically what we are doing when we're

1060
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,960
talking about building 5g

1061
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,880
networks is

1062
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,680
i like to get the picture of building a

1063
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,200
massive puzzle

1064
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,359
with loads of people contributing to

1065
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,720
this puzzle

1066
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,119
and each of these participants that are

1067
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,880
contributing to this puzzle are making

1068
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,280
up their own puzzle pieces

1069
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,359
now these have to be able to be

1070
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,480
interconnected

1071
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,800
and work together to actually form one

1072
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,640
functioning picture

1073
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
so what you get to your mind immediately

1074
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,200
is well someone needs to manage that

1075
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,480
process and that's exactly what we're

1076
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,599
doing so not in terms of having a like a

1077
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
ceo managing everything but we have a

1078
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
technical solution first so this is

1079
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,160
called management and architecture test

1080
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,200
orchestration of software and that's

1081
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,839
another reason another point where

1082
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,680
security concerns come in because this

1083
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,280
is actually one of the

1084
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,640
the um because it's automated it's also

1085
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
one of the things that can be biased

1086
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,800
that can be it can fail

1087
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
which needs to install security

1088
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,720
measurements to actually

1089
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,560
hold everything in place and not to

1090
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,960
allow um faulty

1091
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
pieces of the puzzle to get in which

1092
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
might then propagate throughout the

1093
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,640
whole picture and corrupt your whole

1094
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,440
network so that's one of the of the big

1095
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,200
things that are actually arising with 5g

1096
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,320
now

1097
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,599
having said all of that

1098
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,040
the

1099
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
the thing with the threats

1100
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
in 5g networks is not not it's not just

1101
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,800
that you have this one piece of the

1102
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,680
puzzle that may be broken it's actually

1103
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
that this one piece of the puzzle

1104
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,839
works throughout the whole network and

1105
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,000
it might propagate whatever it is it's

1106
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
doing which is falsely through

1107
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,680
throughout the whole network so you

1108
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,040
might immediately not just have one cell

1109
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,440
or one mast that is corrupted but you

1110
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,839
can in fact corrupt your whole network

1111
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,320
and depending on the scale of your

1112
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,640
network that can have a tremendous

1113
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,720
effect and this is one of the reasons

1114
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,079
why we believe

1115
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,119
although we have not seen 5g attacks to

1116
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,040
the extent that we would have expected

1117
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,760
yet

1118
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
we are we believe that this will be one

1119
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,880
of the huge playgrounds in the future

1120
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,760
and

1121
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
having said that we have not seen those

1122
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,800
attacks yet you also have to to rethink

1123
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,319
this this term

1124
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,240
because we are not we don't have like

1125
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,119
big newspapers saying okay 5g networks

1126
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,880
have been hacked because it's really not

1127
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,640
most people still have a problem with

1128
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,560
the term 5g

1129
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,359
so

1130
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,839
but whenever you read something about

1131
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,560
virtualization vulnerabilities when you

1132
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,319
read something about software supply

1133
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,400
chain vulnerabilities when you read

1134
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,319
something about corrupted software that

1135
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
is being induced into

1136
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,280
modules of software components

1137
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,839
that is actually

1138
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,960
an ancestor to what what what attack

1139
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,079
types you will be seeing in 5g

1140
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,359
now obviously

1141
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,920
right now 5g is still in the rollout

1142
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
people are still a bit insecure this is

1143
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,119
not going to be a playground for script

1144
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,880
kitties this is currently going to be a

1145
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,760
playground for state-sponsored or

1146
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,359
alternatively alternatively

1147
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,560
people with huge financial capacities

1148
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,160
and of course cognitive

1149
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
capacities this is going to be their

1150
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,680
playground first but i think we will be

1151
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
moving towards

1152
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,560
seeing more

1153
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,200
common day attacks on

1154
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,960
5g networks over the next couple of

1155
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,319
years

1156
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,920
in fact

1157
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,119
we have um already about this is an old

1158
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,200
survey from 2021

1159
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,720
so unfortunately the most recent survey

1160
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,280
i could find we have about 70 percent of

1161
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,440
operators have already started to roll

1162
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
out 5g

1163
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,280
to maps to their customers

1164
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,000
um at the same time out of out of these

1165
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
70 that have already ruled out 50 feel

1166
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
that they are not capable of actually

1167
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,520
controlling the security concerns that

1168
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,599
arise with 5g so the ones that i've just

1169
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,520
named especially the software side

1170
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
security concerns of these

1171
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,760
if you want to get more details on how

1172
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,680
exactly these software security concerns

1173
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,480
look

1174
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,160
please read the paper because it's in

1175
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,560
there it's impossible to get

1176
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,319
that message over in 15 minutes so

1177
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
that's why i'm skipping it at this point

1178
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,319
but it's in the paper

1179
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,520
so basically what what you need to do is

1180
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
to think about okay how can i mitigate

1181
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
the strategy how can i mitigate these

1182
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,599
type of attacks

1183
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
and um

1184
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
obviously there there will be many

1185
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,400
solutions to it

1186
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
but one of the reasons why i like to

1187
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,599
speak at cycon is because there's a huge

1188
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,480
gap between decision makers

1189
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,319
and the technical personnel

1190
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,319
it's always been like that it's probably

1191
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,280
always going to be it has gotten better

1192
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,800
over the past couple of years cycle is

1193
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,119
one of the reasons probably why

1194
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,960
but it's always been a concern because

1195
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
they're speaking of two completely

1196
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,480
different things

1197
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,440
so

1198
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,079
one thing that we have proposed

1199
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,880
is

1200
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,319
to actually

1201
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
think about how could we

1202
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,440
improve development teams to be able to

1203
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,079
cope to this new type of attack because

1204
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
usually when you're talking to software

1205
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,560
developers they're not the the biggest

1206
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
fans of security basically because

1207
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,160
security guys are the ones who are

1208
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,400
always trying to to stop you from doing

1209
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,160
all the cool stuff you're kind of

1210
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,319
pushing the break saying okay sorry this

1211
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,240
doesn't work this way you have to get

1212
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
step back you have to reevaluate you

1213
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,839
have to test everything it's tedious

1214
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,280
they don't like us

1215
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,480
okay

1216
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
so but at the same time now software

1217
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,640
developers really crucially need to

1218
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,720
think about security so that's a huge

1219
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,079
challenge for them as well they of

1220
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,680
course they do think about security but

1221
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
not in the same way that we do and

1222
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,440
again also from from this i.t security

1223
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
professional

1224
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,560
side

1225
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,800
we do not think about

1226
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,680
security in the same way as you decision

1227
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
makers will do because you have a

1228
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,760
different view of the things that are

1229
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
going on you have a different view of

1230
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,760
the political challenges especially

1231
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,000
these days that we are facing this is

1232
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
something that we will of course we are

1233
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,920
informed we do read newspapers and

1234
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,760
everything we know these things but we

1235
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,680
have a different view we don't have your

1236
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,319
expertise in these in these terms so

1237
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,920
what can we do

1238
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,760
basically what we are proposing in the

1239
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,640
paper

1240
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,280
is to use the concept of agile

1241
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,520
development teams there are if you're

1242
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
unsure about these also please refer to

1243
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,319
paper it's in there um

1244
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,640
because it's a it's a concept there are

1245
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,720
different concepts of how to do agile

1246
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,839
development

1247
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,640
and these are teams where each person

1248
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
has their own role so you have the

1249
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,359
software developer you have the tester

1250
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,480
you have

1251
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,560
other people around who are doing

1252
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,319
different roles

1253
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,640
and they're trying to to do this in an

1254
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,880
agile way and to to limit themselves to

1255
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,480
their role and not do too many other

1256
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
things in between

1257
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
so one concept that we have proposed in

1258
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,680
the past

1259
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,520
that's actually an article i wrote about

1260
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,280
four years ago i think

1261
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,880
is to induce

1262
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,440
a security personnel into these agile

1263
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,040
development teams

1264
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,680
and taking this on we are now moving

1265
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,960
forward and saying okay actually we

1266
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,880
don't just need security personal and

1267
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
technical terms we actually need

1268
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,680
decision makers to be around and of

1269
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
course that is a huge challenge because

1270
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,359
the decision maker will be sitting there

1271
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,440
saying okay they are talking about some

1272
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,200
kind of rest ap api security terms and i

1273
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,640
don't know what that is

1274
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,480
and i don't i don't really want to

1275
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
understand i can't understand so that's

1276
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
one of the challenges that we we need to

1277
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
educate personal that is actually

1278
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,839
capable of

1279
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,040
um of handling this new situation where

1280
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,760
we don't just have software security

1281
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
concerns as we've always had i mean of

1282
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,920
course we never wanted to have broken

1283
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
software yeah we never wanted to have

1284
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
that but it's been a different it's it's

1285
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,319
different if you just have your piece of

1286
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,400
software that isn't working or whether

1287
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
that piece of software is actually

1288
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,960
making up the bad backbone of our future

1289
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,720
networks

1290
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,200
so that's this is why this this

1291
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,400
situation has changed especially because

1292
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,800
you've deprived yourself of the option

1293
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
of physical security

1294
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,880
not completely yes but to a large extent

1295
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,800
so this is basically the message that

1296
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,760
i'm trying to make i hope that it's

1297
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,920
helped you to kind of get a bit more

1298
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
feeling about 5g

1299
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,280
is that

1300
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
we do need to rethink the way we build

1301
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,720
software not just in terms of building

1302
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,960
the one piece of software but actually

1303
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
in terms of the whole management

1304
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,520
management and orchestration of software

1305
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,599
so it's talking about rollouts about

1306
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,040
updating that's one of the reasons why

1307
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,280
experts are saying that the 5g attack

1308
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,240
surface

1309
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,880
attack surface has multiplied

1310
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,200
because we have software that needs

1311
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
regular updating you can't just build

1312
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,680
your software function and leave it

1313
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,880
there for the next five years that

1314
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,119
doesn't work you will need to update

1315
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,359
these things on a very regular basis now

1316
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,000
there are different opinions on what how

1317
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,839
often you need to do that but somewhere

1318
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,520
between one and two weeks is probably a

1319
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,599
good guess so this is really something

1320
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,920
that needs to get done often so we need

1321
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,240
to manage those we need to we need to

1322
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,960
rethink how to do that and we will need

1323
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,000
personnel in place who not just have a

1324
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,319
good knowledge of software development

1325
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,200
and id security but we especially also

1326
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,079
need decision makers who have a back a

1327
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,319
background and political sciences or in

1328
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,160
social sciences should understand the

1329
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,839
bigger picture of what is going on

1330
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,960
nowadays

1331
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,440
to to be in those teams and to guide

1332
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,119
them through their process

1333
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,880
of development

1334
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,599
so with that i'm going to finalize my

1335
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,440
talk i think i'm within the time i thank

1336
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,040
you very much for your attention i hope

1337
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
you did enjoy it and i hope it helped

1338
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,400
you with the topic of 5g technologies

1339
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,119
thank you very much

1340
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,920
and thank you very much kim and the

1341
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,319
paper is really good it's the last one

1342
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,400
in the book actually so it's easy to

1343
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,440
find um but in that in that paper you

1344
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
mentioned about huawei and in particular

1345
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,280
it's exclusion from different

1346
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
telecommunications networks and in the

1347
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,079
uk we we had the huawei cyber security

1348
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,880
capacity center um sorry cyber security

1349
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,440
evaluation center and we saw a big

1350
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,920
transformation between 4g and 5g

1351
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,599
networks it was seen that we couldn't

1352
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,040
really assure

1353
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,599
um the processes about how we might find

1354
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,599
vulnerabilities in 5g so i'm wondering

1355
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,920
whether you think that the focus on

1356
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,400
supply chain and assurance processes

1357
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,720
maybe don't quite cover um enough of

1358
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,160
what's going on which has been a real

1359
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
focus within the cyber security

1360
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,359
community

1361
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,839
i think it's a very important step which

1362
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,559
has been done for very good reasons and

1363
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
the exclusion of huawei is one of the

1364
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,280
very good reasons of actually doing this

1365
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,280
because of course if you don't trust

1366
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,920
your supplier in your supply chain then

1367
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,319
that's a big no-go yeah so that's the

1368
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,680
first thing

1369
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,880
but on top of that you also need to face

1370
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,000
that

1371
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,040
software may be corrupted not due to

1372
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,119
someone wanting to corrupt it but

1373
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,800
actually due to the software development

1374
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,160
process especially when we're talking

1375
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,520
about agile

1376
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,400
software development is not perfect so

1377
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,880
with every role out depending on of

1378
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,800
course how much time you have you will

1379
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,880
not just introduce new features but you

1380
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,280
will also introduce new vulnerabilities

1381
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,040
that's just something that that comes

1382
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,720
inherently with it

1383
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
of course you can do a lot of things

1384
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,359
better you can try to to be as

1385
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,920
careful as as you can be you can include

1386
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,240
tests um into your software rollout and

1387
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,160
things like that but you still need to

1388
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,480
do that and that's why i believe

1389
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,559
especially given um

1390
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,280
the the importance of 5g in the upcoming

1391
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,400
networks

1392
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,319
that it's not enough with just excluding

1393
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,160
suppliers but that we actually need

1394
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,640
personal on the team that helps the

1395
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,599
developers to to to fulfill their role

1396
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,520
um with these new challenges

1397
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,160
great thank you very much so next we

1398
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,640
have christopher white who unfortunately

1399
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,880
come and come in person today hopefully

1400
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,920
we'll see on the screen very soon and

1401
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
christopher is going to be talking about

1402
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,400
machine expertise in the loop artificial

1403
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,119
intelligence decision making inputs and

1404
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,079
cyber conflicts

1405
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,839
yes great thank you yeah i'm bringing it

1406
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,920
back right now to what uh leonard

1407
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,079
started us off with and talking about ai

1408
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,520
and cyber conflict

1409
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,079
um so uh thank you first of all to all

1410
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,640
the all my panelists for um some very

1411
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,400
interesting papers that i've i've been

1412
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,839
able to read and preparing for today's

1413
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:40,880
session

1414
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
the project i'm going to talk about here

1415
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,000
is um and you can read it in the 2022

1416
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,680
cyclone proceedings of course

1417
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,640
is

1418
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,720
machine expertise in the loop artificial

1419
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,480
intelligence decision making inputs is

1420
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,839
cyber conflict so this project is just

1421
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,520
to kind of preview what i want to talk

1422
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,160
about here this is a progression of work

1423
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
that i've increasingly been undertaking

1424
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,559
at the intersection of new ai systems

1425
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,400
and the dynamics of global cyber

1426
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,720
conflict for the last several years

1427
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,880
the empirical findings of the project

1428
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
the research i'm presenting in the

1429
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
proceedings here are the result of about

1430
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,800
a year's worth of

1431
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
hands-on engagement with elite decision

1432
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,520
makers exploring how they react to and

1433
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,240
then reflect on encountering artificial

1434
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,319
intelligence in the decision making loop

1435
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,359
um in different formats and in different

1436
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,040
i think for a lack of better way of

1437
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,839
putting it different quantities as well

1438
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,880
so i want to walk you through the

1439
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,079
project but the bottom line up front for

1440
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,040
me

1441
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,599
with this work is actually fairly simple

1442
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,920
uh cyber conflict decision makers and

1443
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,400
what i've found with this study don't

1444
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,240
seem to be particularly convinced that

1445
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,000
artificial intelligence is going to

1446
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,079
transform their enterprise so much is

1447
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,760
that it's going to iteratively evolve it

1448
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,839
um and we can have a conversation about

1449
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,280
whether or not that's the kind of

1450
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,960
implemental mindset at work and we're

1451
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,720
just not thinking about the the far

1452
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,640
future horizons or not but but that

1453
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,480
certainly seems to be the trend amongst

1454
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,640
the individuals that i've engaged with

1455
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,720
um unfortunately though um this

1456
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,400
obviously on the one hand means

1457
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,440
unavoidable new ambiguities

1458
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,200
but more importantly it also means that

1459
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,960
there's new space for for the

1460
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,079
development of policy and the

1461
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,319
development of practice that more

1462
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,960
assuages anxiety than it does truly

1463
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,880
resolve strategic

1464
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,880
and operational uncertainties and that's

1465
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,359
that's concerning for a few reasons

1466
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,880
all right let me see if my virtual

1467
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,480
clicker works

1468
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,520
there we go

1469
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,000
so uh given the context of a panel today

1470
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,440
and the work that's already been

1471
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,200
discussed i don't think i particularly

1472
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,040
by dr maschmeyer i don't think i need to

1473
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,720
do too much to describe my starting

1474
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,839
point here

1475
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,319
which is this emerging conversation

1476
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,880
about how ai technologies particularly

1477
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,720
uh advances in machine learning and deep

1478
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,440
reasoning are going to impact cyber

1479
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,559
security and more broadly cyber conflict

1480
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,160
if you go back through the past several

1481
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
cyclone conferences in fact um and then

1482
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,440
looked through

1483
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,800
actually a growing number of scholarly

1484
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,480
outlets over the just past three to four

1485
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,240
years there's a lot more attention

1486
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,960
getting paid to advances in automated

1487
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,240
cyber defenses and the

1488
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,319
intelligentization of malicious tools

1489
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,520
and the development of smart id

1490
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,200
infrastructure and so on and then

1491
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,119
increasingly the implications of all of

1492
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,800
the above for politically and

1493
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,319
economically motivated uh cyber ops um

1494
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,240
i've written a couple of these analyses

1495
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,400
including one two years ago at cyclone

1496
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,680
2020.

1497
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,720
um

1498
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,240
now at present with this debate i think

1499
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,480
i would say that we're in a position uh

1500
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,880
the the kind of nascent cyber conflict

1501
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,599
studies field was in around two decades

1502
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,520
ago maybe give or take a few years and

1503
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,440
that is to say that a lot of analyses

1504
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,359
we've seen to date um some of my own

1505
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,440
included i'll fully admit that they said

1506
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,200
about the question of ai's impact on

1507
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,400
cyber security in a very

1508
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
technology-first fashion um there are a

1509
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,040
lot of good and logical arguments out

1510
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,520
there that basically argue ai is going

1511
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,079
to change the logics of cyber conflicts

1512
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,800
um that we've you know spent a long time

1513
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,319
building understanding of in recent

1514
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,480
years and by that i mean that um you

1515
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,240
know the nature of digital contestation

1516
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
isn't going to change but it is possible

1517
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,480
that transformative enough technology

1518
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,240
technological advances

1519
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,160
might reshape the how the what's the

1520
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,040
whys the value propositions involved in

1521
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,880
cyber operations in both national and

1522
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
international contexts i think ai is

1523
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,880
certainly one set of technologies and i

1524
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,839
think um 5g just referring back to kim's

1525
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,520
talk right there could certainly be

1526
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,800
another

1527
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,480
with ai though

1528
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,040
a lot of arguments so far so far justify

1529
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,640
this idea of you know potentially

1530
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,720
shifting logics of engagement out into

1531
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,839
the future by outlining how um as as

1532
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,920
leonard actually has done how ai enable

1533
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,200
code is potentially going to

1534
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
intelligentize the cyber threat

1535
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,480
environment right doing things like

1536
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,000
making rapid attack surface analyses um

1537
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
automated tactic selection and much more

1538
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,880
the new norms of cyber security

1539
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,640
at least at the higher end and then of

1540
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,480
course ai itself is going to become a

1541
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,079
target it already is a target to be

1542
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,559
attacked and will increasingly be so and

1543
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,200
then largely by a cyrus base a fact that

1544
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,119
suggests that we could probably we

1545
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,960
probably should expect an uptick of

1546
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,599
global cyber assertiveness or aggression

1547
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,240
in certain areas irrespective of you

1548
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,000
know whatever the functional impacts of

1549
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
ai ends up being on either cyber attack

1550
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,640
or defense and so in short a lot of

1551
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,640
people this debate kind of i think you

1552
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,359
can boil it down to to some degree um

1553
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,880
they say the ai stands to make cyber

1554
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,799
conflict you know more expansive more

1555
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,880
high speed less predictable bigger

1556
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,440
faster smarter

1557
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,319
now

1558
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,480
the element of this all of this that

1559
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,440
interests me is not really so much

1560
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
the techno strategic implications of of

1561
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,359
you know new formats of machine

1562
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,119
intelligence new processes new systems

1563
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,040
and so on it's the socio-institutional

1564
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,160
context of it all the

1565
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,920
socio-institutional context in which

1566
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,240
these techniques are being developed and

1567
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,680
into which they're going to be adopted

1568
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
out into the future there's already a

1569
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,480
lot written

1570
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,119
about how ai is likely to reconstitute

1571
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,119
all manner of security relationships in

1572
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,720
international affairs um there's

1573
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,000
actually been some excellent articles

1574
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,520
and books over the past it's a year and

1575
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,119
a half in particular and i'm really

1576
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,640
pleased to see the development of this

1577
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,119
field um well

1578
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,760
you know this reconstitution of security

1579
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,040
relationship this is also going to be

1580
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,559
true and it already is true in a lot of

1581
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,640
instances for those that are attempting

1582
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,799
to leverage ai advances for for national

1583
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,559
security practice including obviously

1584
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,200
the practice of of cyber conflict um

1585
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,359
last year um an american general and

1586
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,599
this was reported um quite prominently

1587
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,200
he stated that western defense

1588
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,640
establishments are we're going to

1589
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,960
inevitably have to undergo uh uh i'm

1590
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,040
quoting here a culture shift in order

1591
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,119
for warfighters and operators to embrace

1592
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,680
ai integration

1593
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,520
honestly that's a really uncontroversial

1594
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,839
statement right these kinds of culture

1595
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,359
shifts were necessary following the

1596
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,440
advent of other revolutionary

1597
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
information technologies everything from

1598
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,240
radar to lethal unmanned aerial systems

1599
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,839
but of course in so many historical

1600
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,480
cases we can see that this needed shift

1601
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,960
to you know uh new culture new doctrine

1602
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,680
new norms um the needy shift in fact uh

1603
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,440
you know in strategic culture as a whole

1604
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,119
it happened in a stunted fashion um how

1605
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,440
fragmented and walled off defense

1606
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,119
establishments can sometimes be

1607
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,520
education levels of defense community

1608
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,920
workforces um the relative conceptual

1609
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,839
distance between current practice and

1610
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,440
and future practice these are all

1611
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,000
factors basically that can dictate how

1612
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,240
successful um the pivot to the future um

1613
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,880
model of approach might actually be and

1614
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,119
so my goal here with this project

1615
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,799
was to take stock of where we are right

1616
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,680
now to study how elite decision makers

1617
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,839
um exactly the kind of people that are

1618
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,359
called upon to make cyber conflict

1619
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,559
decisions react to encountering ai in

1620
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,160
their decision making process and then

1621
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,520
reflect on it afterwards

1622
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,200
so i

1623
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,079
have uh two research questions i set out

1624
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,359
to answer here just let me just read

1625
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,359
them out for you first of all to what

1626
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,520
degree are variable levels of ai

1627
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,599
generated intelligence likely to

1628
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,920
influence elite support for more or less

1629
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,280
assertive policy measures

1630
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,440
secondly to what degree does elite

1631
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,680
support for more or less assertive

1632
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,119
policy measures

1633
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,880
vary based on differential use of ai

1634
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,960
encountered um

1635
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
on the part of the adversary as part of

1636
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,200
a sophisticated cyber operation so when

1637
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,240
the an adversary uses ai um how does

1638
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,160
that uh and how

1639
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,400
you know they encounter um we encounter

1640
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,760
our anniversary using ai in different

1641
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,760
ways how does that affect at least

1642
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,480
choosing to to react uh more or less

1643
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,720
assertively

1644
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,119
so these research questions

1645
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,480
kind of demand their own studies and

1646
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,760
they and they got their own studies but

1647
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,520
the method of approach here was the same

1648
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,520
for me and so i i i think it's uh

1649
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,040
i think it was absolutely a good idea

1650
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,359
for me to present these together um so

1651
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,760
during 2020 and then into about mid late

1652
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,839
2021 i ran a series of uh war game

1653
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,040
simulations uh with professional

1654
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,280
military education institutions pmes and

1655
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,200
their in their student bodies um the

1656
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,040
populations for the war games were

1657
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,000
military officers pma faculty and staff

1658
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,960
and a range of other national security

1659
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,200
specialists at these schools

1660
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,920
both visiting and and otherwise

1661
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,839
participants were

1662
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,520
various nationalities but primarily

1663
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,400
american german slovenians there were a

1664
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,559
handful of australians

1665
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,559
dutch and british personnel sprinkled in

1666
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,440
as well

1667
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,680
and these war games are

1668
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,480
pseudo-experimental that means just the

1669
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,000
gruesome participants get randomly

1670
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,839
sorted into treatment categories so that

1671
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,640
we can extract data about diversion

1672
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,040
experiences within the game environment

1673
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,799
so the first study addressing the first

1674
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,040
research question had participants being

1675
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,280
presented with a developing situation

1676
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,200
where a foreign nation appears to be

1677
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,119
linked to low-intensity intrusions

1678
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,119
against government i.t infrastructure

1679
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,119
the treatment here was the way in which

1680
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,960
intelligence assessments were presented

1681
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,040
to the participants namely an intel

1682
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,960
assessment entirely produced by humans

1683
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,079
intel assessments uh coming from defense

1684
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,160
department ai systems the kind of thing

1685
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,240
that presents data it contextualizes but

1686
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,319
then it leaves the final reporting and

1687
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,559
the evaluations up to humans in the loop

1688
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,799
or finally intel that was entirely

1689
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,200
generated down to the recommendations by

1690
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,160
an ai system

1691
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,559
in study number two participants get a

1692
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,960
similar scenario a preparatory cyber

1693
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
campaign appearing to lay the groundwork

1694
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,119
for potential disruption a major

1695
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,599
interference operation in this case

1696
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,200
though it was the

1697
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,359
presentation of rival state capabilities

1698
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:42,880
that varied across the participant

1699
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,280
groups and so specifically there were

1700
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,680
there were three groups here uh first of

1701
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,280
all a group that encountered basically

1702
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,480
no ai involved in how they encountered

1703
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,319
the adversary's input to the to the

1704
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,839
episode

1705
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,680
secondly a group or a set of groups i

1706
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,640
should say

1707
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,520
that um that saw rival cyber activities

1708
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,680
being tactically enabled and determined

1709
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,400
by ai systems but under the auspices of

1710
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,920
well-established and decently well

1711
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,839
understood strategic objectives clearly

1712
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,839
set by by humans on the other side of

1713
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,640
the divide and then finally a group that

1714
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,559
encountered cyber activities being

1715
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,440
conducted as a result of ai systems

1716
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,200
being used fairly holistically by the

1717
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,359
the rival state to dictate strategic

1718
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,799
preferences

1719
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,720
um in both studies of course this is

1720
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,160
quite similar to the survey experiment

1721
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,480
described by miguel

1722
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,119
who presented uh two papers ago in both

1723
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,880
studies participants fill out pre-study

1724
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,799
questionnaires they give gives a lot of

1725
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,480
information about their background their

1726
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,680
preferences

1727
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,440
and then the games then gauge their

1728
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,440
preferences in a number of different and

1729
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,680
i think interesting ways so you know on

1730
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,280
an escalation ladder what level of

1731
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,799
response are you going to take given the

1732
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,640
information given to you what kind of

1733
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,160
information would be more useful to you

1734
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,000
here how confident are you in your

1735
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,079
assessments that kind of thing and then

1736
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,559
participants and this is the value of

1737
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,280
simulations of war games as a series of

1738
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,440
ir articles have um

1739
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,200
have recently spoken to

1740
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,720
participants were debriefed at the end

1741
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,960
of the game so that we can get rich data

1742
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,640
that lets us dig deeper into the

1743
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,640
reactions to the scenario details

1744
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,880
so let me um

1745
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,039
walk you through a couple of findings

1746
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,319
i hope you're all going to read the

1747
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,920
these papers in the proceedings these

1748
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,440
are these are i think quite interesting

1749
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,240
papers um and i hope mine is is of

1750
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,079
interest to many of you um let me just

1751
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,000
take a few minutes here to to preview

1752
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,680
what i saw as the biggest findings from

1753
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,200
the initial analysis of the data i

1754
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,119
gathered which was gathered by the way

1755
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,319
from about 800 789 participants across

1756
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,240
these studies

1757
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,799
so first of all so the treatment groups

1758
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,720
in both studies

1759
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,960
they can probably be best thought of

1760
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,319
very simply as the no ai decision makers

1761
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,720
those who only encountered tactical ai

1762
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,039
usage and those dealing with strategic

1763
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,440
ai employment in the environment and so

1764
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,359
i found evidence that those that were

1765
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,680
faced with tactical ai usage by

1766
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,680
adversaries were much more willing to

1767
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,440
act assertively in responding to the

1768
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,680
scenario in early game stages than their

1769
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,960
counterparts

1770
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,119
but on the flip side of things

1771
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,039
there was a lot of robust evidence of

1772
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,359
restraint when ai was used in a more

1773
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,119
holistic and strategic fashion or

1774
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,680
observed to be used in that fashion

1775
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,680
um in both studies actually the the kind

1776
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,920
of strategic ai groups they were much

1777
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,240
more inclined to wait and see to use

1778
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,720
diplomacy to take private channel

1779
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,880
options than anything more assertive and

1780
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,039
they didn't escalate in later phases of

1781
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,319
the game

1782
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,920
and so in debriefing it really became

1783
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,760
apparent that a lot of decision makers

1784
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,079
see or they saw in this game at least

1785
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,880
adversary willingness to use ai

1786
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,240
tactically to upgrade their cyber ops as

1787
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,119
a sign of greater aggressive intent in

1788
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,640
and of itself

1789
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,559
but then on the other side of things

1790
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,880
there was consensus that strategic ai

1791
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,000
employment in pretty much any form

1792
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,079
where operations might lead on from ai

1793
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,839
processes were

1794
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,240
premature and they were extremely likely

1795
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,480
prone to error and so caution became a

1796
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,599
strategic imperative

1797
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,000
the second uh finding i think worth

1798
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,559
underlining here is that um and this is

1799
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,480
again a tie-in to one of the earlier

1800
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,599
papers knowledge uh know-how about cyber

1801
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,599
conflict about artificial intelligence

1802
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,039
about international conflict

1803
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,960
international relations actually did

1804
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,599
very little to predict greater levels of

1805
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,760
confidence amongst respondents

1806
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,839
uh in their their assessments when it

1807
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,400
came to strategic ai usage and so the

1808
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,200
general idea that came out in debriefing

1809
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,079
of of these military officers and pme

1810
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,640
faculty and so on was not so much that

1811
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,880
ai might be changing the nature or the

1812
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,559
logic of the game being played so much

1813
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:47,520
as again

1814
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,760
it might just be error prone and prone

1815
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,160
to human misuse and i actually took this

1816
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,559
result quite positively as opposed to

1817
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,920
the the next finding i want to talk

1818
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,520
about in conclusion

1819
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,359
i took this quite positively because

1820
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,359
respondents with strong subject matter

1821
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,440
backgrounds generally seem to remain

1822
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,400
aware of the fact that misdesign and

1823
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,720
misuse were the real source of a lot of

1824
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,799
potential ambiguity now the populations

1825
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,720
that i'm just as a kind of a caveat that

1826
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,480
i was looking at here are really

1827
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,640
actually very good proxies which you

1828
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,480
don't always get for the kinds of

1829
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,480
decision makers we think of when we

1830
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,640
think of cyber conflict it's likely of

1831
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,599
course that a lot more civilian um

1832
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,280
stakeholders and decision makers are in

1833
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,039
the loops or in the processes that i'm

1834
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:30,880
i'm attempting to describe here and so

1835
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,599
this may not hold quite so true for

1836
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,200
other populations but at least for the

1837
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,280
specialists in the room i thought this

1838
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,680
was quite a positive uh finding

1839
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,160
to be a little bit more negative though

1840
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,599
finally and i think perhaps most

1841
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,960
interestingly the findings in this

1842
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,359
project really showed that ai induced

1843
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,960
hesitancy

1844
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,200
might be partially resolved just by the

1845
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,440
mere perception of humans at work

1846
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,280
somewhere in the loop and so a lot of

1847
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,880
participants pointed out that the

1848
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,039
tactical ai usage that was described in

1849
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,200
these simulations wasn't really a far

1850
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
cry from from tools from systems that

1851
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,799
they actually were already familiar with

1852
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,079
in the real world

1853
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,319
um it's interesting

1854
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,079
but the findings the way that they're

1855
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,079
outlined in the paper and please go read

1856
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,400
if this is of interest to you um they're

1857
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,720
potentially concerning because both of

1858
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,119
the tactical ai treatment groups in both

1859
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,880
studies were the ones that were far more

1860
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,039
likely than their peers to escalate the

1861
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,520
crisis um situation across different

1862
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,440
phases of the game

1863
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,839
the idea that that appeared i think most

1864
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,359
clearly in debriefing this pertinent

1865
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,000
here is that encountering limited ai

1866
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
enabled capabilities in the field again

1867
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,880
might reflect this clearer assessment of

1868
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,359
aggressive intent than the alternative

1869
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,520
whilst ai delivered intel that is

1870
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,319
contextualized by a human is likely

1871
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,079
although if you look at my findings it's

1872
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,760
statistically significant but it's only

1873
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,680
slightly more likely than the no ai

1874
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,240
scenario to deliver a more trustworthy

1875
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,839
picture of the situation for decision

1876
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,680
makers

1877
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,359
we're clearly talking about validation

1878
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,000
effects here of a sort in both instances

1879
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,079
and that's a little concerning actually

1880
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,440
because it means that there exists the

1881
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,599
possibility that some decision makers

1882
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,839
can experience a false sense of

1883
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,319
validation of their assumptions without

1884
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,839
really giving appropriate thought to the

1885
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,599
credibility of the outposts that are

1886
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,799
being presented to them all just because

1887
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,200
there is a human in the loop

1888
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,799
this is obviously something i'm going to

1889
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,039
try to study in much more granular

1890
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,599
detail going forward but this is i think

1891
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,359
quite an interesting um finding

1892
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,960
let me let me finish this there overall

1893
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,559
i really i really hope that the studies

1894
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,319
i'm presenting in this paper which of

1895
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,319
course as with most of my colleagues

1896
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,480
here are part of larger projects but i

1897
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,240
hope these studies are useful for those

1898
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,200
that are actually in the thick of

1899
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,359
thinking about um necessarily culture

1900
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,319
shifts

1901
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,000
the adoption of ai and western defense

1902
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,839
communities um there are clearly

1903
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,559
challenges to be overcome uh beyond just

1904
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,799
the technologies involved beyond just

1905
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,839
providing for relative ai education in

1906
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,319
fairly diverse defense workforces

1907
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,079
i would say that at the very least

1908
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,720
extreme scrutiny about the intelligence

1909
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,280
analytic process the loop needs not only

1910
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,880
to be an element of any um process that

1911
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,559
we develop going forward but also a

1912
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,560
cultural expectation there needs to be a

1913
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,158
culture of extreme scrutiny of of these

1914
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,839
processes that might involve machine

1915
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,198
intelligence and with that i hope i'm

1916
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:27,040
still within my time i'll i'll end here

1917
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,799
and move us on to the panel discussion

1918
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,679
but thank you very much

1919
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,359
thank you very much christopher and i

1920
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,960
think i want to just linger on that

1921
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,279
question of expertise and how it

1922
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,920
develops because in your paper you

1923
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,799
talk a bit about how expertise kind of

1924
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,439
changes how people respond i'm wondering

1925
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,439
whether that's a kind of the results

1926
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,000
that you found are a product of the

1927
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,080
present and maybe as we see in the next

1928
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,640
10 20 years as people with those skills

1929
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,479
and knowledge of ai whether we'll see

1930
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,718
any changes

1931
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,600
i think we have to be hopeful that we

1932
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,040
will of course um see those changes

1933
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:11,839
the

1934
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,520
trick i think

1935
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,839
uh for me is that the populations i've

1936
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,439
been looking at here i think i mentioned

1937
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,198
this there are actually i think

1938
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,198
surprisingly good proxies for those

1939
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,560
decision makers

1940
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,040
of you know cyber conflict cyber

1941
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,439
operations the

1942
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,600
the idea that they might actually

1943
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,198
already be somewhat familiar with these

1944
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,880
ideas presents somewhat of a

1945
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,520
generalization issue here um we may be

1946
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,359
looking in this study

1947
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,399
at folks that basically have good tacit

1948
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,000
knowledge about

1949
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,158
ai in cyber conflict or even just cyber

1950
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,759
concepts in general and of course tacit

1951
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,000
knowledge is that kind of of knowledge

1952
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,158
that is very difficult to communicate to

1953
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:53,279
other people um it's not enough to to

1954
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,280
educate somebody about what ai is to

1955
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,800
have them to have them read leonard's

1956
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,159
paper and kind of you know know about

1957
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,000
about the potential strategic issues

1958
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,159
bound up in um in the development and

1959
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,480
the application of these technologies um

1960
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,480
it's more complicated than that um and

1961
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,560
so we face a real challenge going

1962
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,040
forward in designing education training

1963
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,560
uh programs that effectively

1964
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,440
communicate lessons that are socially

1965
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,280
learned that are something that is you

1966
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,120
know again traditionally very difficult

1967
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,800
to communicate in you know conventional

1968
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,880
uh general education requirement

1969
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,320
training within you know any workforce

1970
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,920
yeah i think that response speaks to

1971
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,679
almost all the papers right and i think

1972
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,920
we've all focused on expertise or the

1973
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,280
development of expertise in different

1974
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,120
ways whether that's in militaries

1975
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,600
whether that's in the publics or within

1976
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,080
5g infrastructures and someone who works

1977
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,159
in offensive type strategy and i reverse

1978
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,679
engineered malware it's been really

1979
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,880
really interesting to see how these

1980
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,000
different communities need to start

1981
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,480
speaking and developing and those

1982
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,000
different kind of cultural and social

1983
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,239
habits but what i'll do is i'll push it

1984
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,679
out to the audience so i've got about 20

1985
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,560
minutes

1986
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,080
left of the session if anyone's got any

1987
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,840
questions so i see your first question

1988
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,159
over there

1989
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,120
yeah hi um

1990
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,960
leonard question to you super

1991
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,280
interesting topic uh thank you so much

1992
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,239
for your

1993
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,760
expertise and for sharing all of that

1994
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,679
with us with us

1995
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,239
um two super brief questions really just

1996
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,760
clarifications actually so you were

1997
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,080
saying there are three major attack

1998
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,880
paths

1999
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,840
right if you want to include uh

2000
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,840
autonomous systems so this would be

2001
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,000
development compromise data portioning

2002
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,040
and input manipulation right so i just

2003
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,760
wanted to quickly ask could you point

2004
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,840
out what do you think is like the most

2005
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,000
likely interference path and why

2006
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,239
and then the second one is again a

2007
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,120
clarification he said main risk is the

2008
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,840
systemic subversion of the units due to

2009
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,360
black boxing

2010
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,040
if you could just elaborate on that a

2011
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,159
little bit that would be great thanks

2012
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,480
sure let's go ahead yeah yeah

2013
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,080
thanks for the questions

2014
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,199
so on the yeah the most likely path

2015
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,280
i don't think i can

2016
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,600
say this it's an interesting question

2017
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,239
because i laid out kind of the threshold

2018
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,920
of access you need right for the

2019
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,239
development compromise it's the highest

2020
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,239
but the level of manipulation you can

2021
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,480
carry out is also the greatest i think

2022
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,239
it really depends on the objective that

2023
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,840
you have and the possibility of

2024
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,000
accessing it and especially in military

2025
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
context getting access i mean this is it

2026
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,159
becomes a classic intelligence problem

2027
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,480
if your adversary gets access to some

2028
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,800
you know important development project

2029
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,320
that's a problem not just in this

2030
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,600
context

2031
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,920
but it's very hard to do so i would say

2032
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,239
this is probably the least likely

2033
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,840
and but the data poisoning that's a

2034
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,440
really interesting one because we know

2035
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,679
that the bigger the data set is the

2036
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,679
better the output becomes the better the

2037
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,679
model becomes and that means there are a

2038
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,000
lot of incentives for centralization of

2039
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,199
data sets

2040
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,440
and of reusing the same kind of data

2041
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,760
sets for different purposes and that

2042
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,120
that would mean though there is one

2043
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,480
central point

2044
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,239
of attack that you could target

2045
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,600
that's the

2046
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,679
most efficient way to do this the most

2047
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,400
secure way would be to re-develop put

2048
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,320
together a different data set for each

2049
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,719
task but that would take huge

2050
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,000
investments

2051
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,679
and i'm not sure how easy that would be

2052
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,360
to defend also from an institutional

2053
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,560
perspective so on that one i'm not sure

2054
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,159
honest answer

2055
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,920
but i would expect that then the because

2056
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,600
it's the easiest from that perspective

2057
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,760
the third one the input manipulation

2058
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,520
if you find a way to do it

2059
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,880
that's the least

2060
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,199
investment least resources you need and

2061
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,880
compared to the highest payoff you get

2062
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,440
so i would expect that to be the most

2063
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,840
likely path

2064
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
yeah i'm sorry you also had the question

2065
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,600
sorry i just remembered on the systemic

2066
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,719
subversion

2067
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:51,760
um

2068
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,600
well the point i want to make there is

2069
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,679
just it's the same with vulnerabilities

2070
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,920
in computer systems now right if if

2071
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,000
there is a vulnerability

2072
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,400
say i mean the via sub case that we had

2073
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,080
the cyber attack against ukraine is a

2074
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,199
good example right there was a

2075
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,960
vulnerability in this specific type of

2076
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,760
modem and then all of them are affected

2077
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,520
and that produces the collateral damage

2078
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,760
that we've seen across europe

2079
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,360
and it would be the same thing right you

2080
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,520
have one type of unit if there's a

2081
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,080
vulnerability it would not only affect

2082
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,400
if you have a way to proliferate it at

2083
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,320
least this is then becomes a bigger

2084
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,320
question are these going to be networked

2085
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,280
you know is there going to be

2086
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,719
communication between them you would

2087
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,360
expect there to be and if so you would

2088
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,520
be able to proliferate this exploit

2089
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,760
across the whole army or perhaps you

2090
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,280
know across the globe

2091
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,040
across any country that is fielding

2092
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,199
these kinds of units so that's that's

2093
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,839
the basic idea

2094
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,480
i sold one further back over there first

2095
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,400
yeah that person yep you

2096
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,679
hi um michael t meyer i'm the director

2097
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,199
of the u.s national ai and cyber

2098
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,199
security isao i have a question for

2099
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,640
christopher white

2100
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,320
um i think uh one of the biggest

2101
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,000
challenges with ai always has been

2102
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,239
deriving inputs from outputs right

2103
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,880
and in 2018 i was at the belfast center

2104
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,600
and the big conversation that we had was

2105
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,239
if we are using intelligence reports how

2106
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,480
can we actually increase this confidence

2107
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
on behalf of the decision maker when

2108
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,480
they're receiving it and ai was a factor

2109
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,760
that went into

2110
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,640
that report generation are you available

2111
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,280
aware of any sort of war games or

2112
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,440
research that was evaluating or

2113
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,320
assessing the impact of explainable ai

2114
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,040
white boxing and black boxing

2115
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,320
in order to increase basically

2116
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,159
confidence and trust decision makers

2117
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,960
so the short answer is i'm not actually

2118
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,000
i'm

2119
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,360
i've been involved in a few uh

2120
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,640
war game

2121
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,120
war games that uh you know have occurred

2122
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,400
uh

2123
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,440
organized by by service uh personnel

2124
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,120
over the past year so i'm not

2125
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,440
particularly aware of uh other

2126
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,679
researchers having run simulations that

2127
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:04,719
take aim

2128
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,800
specifically at you know variable

2129
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,440
solutions for for the issues that i'm

2130
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,000
uh i'm looking to hear um i know that's

2131
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,679
not a very satisfying answer i'm afraid

2132
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:14,560
to say

2133
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,239
um

2134
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,760
yeah i know that's not a very satisfying

2135
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,360
answer i would be very happy to talk

2136
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,800
further with you about it though um

2137
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,040
offline

2138
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,440
let's do it

2139
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,040
yeah yeah so you want to take these two

2140
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,320
questions all right yeah yeah

2141
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,760
thank you i'm manfred budrodema the nato

2142
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,440
chief information officer i've got a

2143
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,199
question for kim

2144
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,280
and the rest of the panel and then first

2145
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,239
of all i loved the analogy of the puzzle

2146
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,159
for the 5g

2147
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,520
and how do you see the application of ai

2148
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,920
in detecting inauthentic

2149
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,080
placements of puzzle pieces right that

2150
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,520
could spread out to the rest of the

2151
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,280
network

2152
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,880
um so short answer yes i do see that

2153
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,080
there is a lot of room for for that kind

2154
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,280
of

2155
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,320
approach

2156
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,760
um and i'm

2157
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,679
pretty confident that there will be um

2158
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,920
but of course like there have been other

2159
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,360
talks about ai and i.t security and

2160
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,600
the short message of all of these talks

2161
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,600
is that there is a drawback because it

2162
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,800
has to do how how ai works and of course

2163
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,960
there's also a discussion on whether the

2164
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,960
type of ai that we're looking at today

2165
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,920
which is often more statistical analysis

2166
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,000
whether that really is ai or whether

2167
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,199
it's

2168
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,000
not like in a technical term it's not ai

2169
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,080
it's more analysis

2170
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,040
of course it depends on where this ai

2171
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,360
development is going

2172
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,360
there is already in software development

2173
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,760
you do already have automated checks so

2174
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,760
there is already a lot of these kind of

2175
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,679
things that are being done

2176
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,400
whether that really is true ai is

2177
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
something that you can discuss

2178
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,560
takes depends a bit on what your stance

2179
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,920
is and and how how sharp you are on on

2180
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,719
the definition of ai um but yes yes

2181
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,920
short answer yes i think there is um

2182
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,480
really a good room for development um to

2183
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,000
include ai especially generally in

2184
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
software development but especially in

2185
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,159
5g because what is so important about 5g

2186
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,480
which is different from i.t security and

2187
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,280
other areas is

2188
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,239
i.t security is often playing hide and

2189
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,280
seek

2190
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,080
and

2191
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,920
this is something that we need to move

2192
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,440
away from because in 5g we don't have

2193
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,320
the time to wait until the attack is

2194
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,800
there and then respond we need to be

2195
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,440
active we need to be proactive so in

2196
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,320
2016 at cycle we actually had the topic

2197
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,000
act of cyber defense some of you might

2198
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,360
recall it

2199
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,840
so this is coming back to in order to be

2200
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,920
able to move forward we need to be more

2201
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,920
active we can't wait for the attack to

2202
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,440
be there

2203
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,480
yeah i think that's really interesting

2204
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
point which doesn't just apply to 5g

2205
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,080
telecommunications but across crystal

2206
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,600
national infrastructures and we might

2207
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,640
look at the eu's nis directive etc as

2208
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,239
part of that development of thinking in

2209
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,840
that way okay

2210
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,040
next question yeah

2211
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,360
hi i'm scott milne from the uk ministry

2212
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,679
of defense cyber specialist unit i have

2213
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,239
a question for kim and you talked a bit

2214
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,159
about some of the new vulnerabilities

2215
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,840
that have been introduced

2216
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,880
in 5g architecture and can you also

2217
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,800
comment on whether there have been any

2218
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,480
new security controls introduced at the

2219
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,199
same time to defend against for example

2220
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,040
lateral movement and infection within

2221
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,320
the core network

2222
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,239
i'm sorry i'm afraid i didn't get the

2223
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,840
last part of your question i got the

2224
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,400
first part so

2225
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,600
has there been

2226
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,800
new uh controls introduced in 5g

2227
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,199
architecture security controls to

2228
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,120
protect against

2229
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,199
cyber vulnerabilities such as lateral

2230
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,960
movement and infection

2231
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,400
okay so thank you very much for the

2232
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,080
question because that's one of the big

2233
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,000
points that i didn't make earlier of

2234
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,040
course

2235
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,760
5g is not just all vulnerability yeah so

2236
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,320
the software the softwarization also

2237
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,719
gives us a lot of opportunities

2238
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,960
to actually improve our security but at

2239
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,880
the same time we also introduce a new

2240
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,679
set of vulnerabilities and the issue

2241
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,679
that the iit security

2242
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,840
community has with 5g is that the um the

2243
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,000
security measures that you're capable of

2244
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,400
installing um

2245
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,360
is

2246
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,320
less

2247
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,600
than the

2248
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,199
than the threat surface that you are

2249
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,440
adding so that is basically the the

2250
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,280
drawback so of course there are there

2251
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,600
are loads of options um especially when

2252
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,040
it comes to encryption and stuff like

2253
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,600
that and of course you it's also a huge

2254
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,320
opportunity as i said earlier

2255
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,719
what the softwareization also means is

2256
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,120
that you need to update regularly so you

2257
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,400
won't have

2258
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,360
your

2259
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,840
5 or 10 year old machine standing in

2260
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,760
some room that nobody ever looks at you

2261
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,040
have software which is going to be

2262
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,880
managed and which is going to be

2263
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,880
developed and revolved on a frequently

2264
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,600
basis so that is a huge advantage this

2265
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,880
is one of the things why i think this

2266
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,639
topic is so interesting because this is

2267
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,960
one of the the instances in time when we

2268
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,000
actually really have the opportunity to

2269
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,639
step away from this hide and seek game

2270
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,120
and to actually move forward and get

2271
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,920
ahead of our attackers so that's one of

2272
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,880
the the huge advantages of 5g so there's

2273
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,600
a

2274
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,840
very much room to to actually move

2275
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,679
forward and to get better but at the

2276
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,639
same time we have a load

2277
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,040
a whole new set of vulnerabilities that

2278
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,880
that are coming in and that we need to

2279
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,199
address and as i quoted earlier in the

2280
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,719
survey

2281
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,719
we are not quite prepared for that and

2282
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,960
that's that's the issue that's that's

2283
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,040
exactly the issue and that's why we need

2284
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,400
to think about what can we do to improve

2285
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,800
that to actually use this advantage that

2286
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,360
we are getting with the softwareization

2287
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,840
thank you very much

2288
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,560
yeah i have a friend here

2289
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,239
thank you so much i have a question to

2290
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,880
dr gomez regarding the results about the

2291
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,120
public opinion do you think your results

2292
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:23,040
are regime specific and would the what

2293
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,960
do you think whether they would change

2294
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,800
if for instance the study was conducted

2295
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,000
around

2296
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,040
uh more authority authoritative states

2297
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,400
and their public opinion thank you um i

2298
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,440
would say cautiously that yes there is a

2299
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,480
possibility

2300
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,600
for them to change um

2301
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,480
a lot of it revolves around

2302
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,360
existing beliefs that

2303
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,239
uh

2304
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,639
publics may have about

2305
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,719
relationships so what we did with the

2306
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,120
experiment to try to rule that out was

2307
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,440
to not explicitly mention who the target

2308
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,440
was and who the initiator was

2309
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,120
but the fact that

2310
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,800
the respondents

2311
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,120
gravitated towards

2312
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,120
mostly identifying the us as an

2313
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,400
initiator

2314
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,600
suggests that there might be uh

2315
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,360
beliefs underlying beliefs about who

2316
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,960
acts in this space

2317
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,080
and

2318
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,000
how these actors act specifically um may

2319
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,639
shape uh preferences so

2320
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:23,760
i would

2321
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,520
cautiously say for the moment that we

2322
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,400
could

2323
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,320
see a change in how they respond if we

2324
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,560
were to replicate this in more

2325
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,639
authoritarian states or even in

2326
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,960
other states with

2327
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,199
existing alliance relationships but that

2328
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,920
relationship would not be as

2329
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,840
established or there might not be as

2330
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,440
much historical

2331
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,040
weight to these relationships that could

2332
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,800
again shift how publics view it

2333
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,960
any more questions

2334
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,040
um yeah so we'll probably take two so if

2335
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,800
we take that one first and that one's

2336
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,719
seconds thank you

2337
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,120
hi uh john fernandes i'm from the u.s

2338
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,719
army cyber institute

2339
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,120
uh i had a question for you leonard um

2340
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,280
just as you're talking about kind of we

2341
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,520
couldn't mitigate the autonomous um

2342
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,960
decision making

2343
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,639
i was interested in what your thoughts

2344
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,400
were about some of the other fields in

2345
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,320
ai when we start talking about using

2346
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,760
knowledge bases or using more of a

2347
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,840
hierarchical rule system

2348
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,320
or even just tuning how you build your

2349
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,880
models to incorporate explainable ai if

2350
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,320
you thought those would be some ways to

2351
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,320
mitigate or at least validate and test

2352
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,040
thanks yeah this is let's really just

2353
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,760
say

2354
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,040
the second question all right that's

2355
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,880
okay

2356
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,120
yep

2357
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,560
uh hello um i'm jeremy from the dutchess

2358
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,719
habits of heights organization in berlin

2359
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,440
um i guess this question pertains to

2360
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,199
uh ai laws and the sort of 5g

2361
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,639
discussions

2362
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,440
but the general implications seem to be

2363
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,400
that

2364
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,239
we there are enormous sort of structural

2365
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,159
problems that require sort of oversight

2366
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,159
all sort of governance auditing

2367
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,520
of these sort of technological

2368
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,679
developments and yet because of the

2369
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,239
utility of these technologies or the

2370
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,120
sort of need for speed and efficiencies

2371
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,560
we're going to end up sort of making

2372
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,400
these mistakes anyway and i guess

2373
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,679
looking at the current security

2374
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,520
landscape are there any lessons that we

2375
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,760
should be drawing regarding what sort of

2376
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,920
sort of auditing or oversight processes

2377
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,320
work what mistakes have been made what

2378
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,600
we need to learn from the current

2379
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,880
landscape going forward

2380
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,960
all right i was going to say yeah thanks

2381
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,400
for the question

2382
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,920
this is really it goes into the

2383
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,239
technical aspects of it that i am not

2384
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,159
really the best expert in because i'm a

2385
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,840
political scientist so i'm looking

2386
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,960
that's why i've been focusing on the

2387
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
strategic context here too and that

2388
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,440
means i need to rely on researchers on

2389
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,440
computer science especially

2390
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,800
or in ai to to figure this out i depend

2391
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,480
on you know what the findings are so

2392
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,320
what i see as a political scientist is

2393
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,560
that yes there are some possible

2394
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,880
mitigations but just this morning i was

2395
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,639
reading bruce schneier's block and i saw

2396
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,360
there was also a new technique for

2397
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,679
manipulating

2398
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,280
pattern recognition without data

2399
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,840
poisoning just by changing the order of

2400
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,159
the images that are input by having you

2401
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,000
know having very biased images at the

2402
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,159
beginning completely changing the way

2403
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,520
the model is trained because apparently

2404
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,719
at that phase

2405
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,040
it shapes to a great extent how this

2406
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,800
model looks like later

2407
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,239
so it looks as if on both sides we see

2408
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,320
continuous development and it is not yet

2409
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,800
clear if someone in the audience is you

2410
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,480
know more well-versed in the technical

2411
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,400
aspects also if you want to tell me i'm

2412
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,320
completely wrong i really welcome that

2413
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,759
because that'd be interesting feedback

2414
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,920
and your response power from the other

2415
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,920
question

2416
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,159
okay

2417
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:56,559
any other questions from the audience

2418
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,600
so i think what um i'll comment on is um

2419
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,360
there's been a lot of discussion or kind

2420
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,560
of commentary that maybe the promise of

2421
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,120
ai or the kind of the

2422
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,199
resilience that we have that we might

2423
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,800
what what's been happening ukraine

2424
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
suggests that actually maybe we won't

2425
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,480
quite see um

2426
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,960
laws deployed we don't need it to or

2427
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,639
actually we do have fairly good

2428
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,560
resilient systems i'm wondering whether

2429
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,880
that's a good um way of kind of

2430
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,560
summarizing what we might be learning

2431
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,040
from ukraine or not and if anyone's got

2432
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,840
any thoughts on that

2433
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,400
yeah to me

2434
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,800
if i may take that one that goes to the

2435
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
point i made earlier

2436
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,040
where we know the strategic value of

2437
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,800
cyber operations that pursue active

2438
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,679
effects is relatively limited because

2439
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,280
you know the more intensely at least

2440
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,960
that's been my argument the more intense

2441
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,199
the effect is that you pursue the harder

2442
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,880
it is to get it in a reliable way and

2443
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,480
the longer it takes

2444
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,400
and because the payoff is relatively low

2445
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,920
i mean if you want to destroy something

2446
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,679
you can just use conventional weapons

2447
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,520
very basic point but also in the gray

2448
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,600
zone between that the more intense it

2449
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,679
gets the effect you pursue the less

2450
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,159
effective cyber operations become as a

2451
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,239
strategic option for producing that

2452
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,440
effect

2453
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,600
but i see that very different in the

2454
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,000
scenario of you know laid out if so if

2455
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,440
you are let's i don't know how many

2456
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,120
years in the future if you have you know

2457
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,880
you're fighting an enemy that has

2458
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,600
fielded this great army of laws that

2459
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,840
possibly are better than your own but

2460
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,760
you have found a vulnerability

2461
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,000
which is extremely hard to exploit and

2462
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
maybe takes a lot of resources and a

2463
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,480
long time but potentially gives you the

2464
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,040
advantage in case of battle and a great

2465
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,960
element of surprise right i mean what

2466
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,440
better surprise also strategic surprise

2467
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,840
is there than just switching off that

2468
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,400
army or turning it against the adversary

2469
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,199
so because you know the the benefits

2470
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:50,000
potential benefits are so great

2471
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,880
and therefore the incentives to invest a

2472
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,960
lot of resources and time into it i

2473
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,760
don't think this is a lesson we can draw

2474
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,080
rather it might be actually as i said

2475
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,000
right where we see this the cyber war

2476
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,480
visions fulfilled because we do have

2477
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,719
lethal or systems capable of lethal

2478
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,000
effects that are out there and have

2479
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,320
vulnerabilities

2480
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,960
anyone else want to jump in um

2481
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,159
i agree with leonard in this to the in

2482
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,920
at least in his argument that what we're

2483
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,320
seeing right now in ukraine is that

2484
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,880
cyber would have limited effects because

2485
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,719
it's a lot more difficult to actually

2486
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,480
plan around that when it's much simpler

2487
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,360
to

2488
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,679
use conventional munitions but i think

2489
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,600
another important lesson that ukraine

2490
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,120
highlights is that

2491
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,040
it's just as important to look at what

2492
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,719
the effects are

2493
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,960
and it's also important to

2494
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,440
evaluate how decision makers got to that

2495
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,960
point why do we see continuous use of

2496
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,360
cyber operations when what we've learned

2497
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,480
over the last few years and most

2498
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,840
recently in ukraine is that they're not

2499
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,360
that effective so

2500
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,600
why do states continuous continue to

2501
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,280
invest in them emergent those smaller

2502
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,880
powers continue to invest in them when

2503
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,280
in fact the returns are so low so it's

2504
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,880
the thinking around

2505
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,080
um

2506
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,560
these decisions that i th that would

2507
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,080
probably be worth investigating

2508
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,800
if i can just uh jump in on on that

2509
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,239
question i know the time is up but i

2510
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,239
think it's a very interesting topic to

2511
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,440
discuss about

2512
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,920
uh especially because i look at it a bit

2513
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,199
different than you two do i think in

2514
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,639
technical terms

2515
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,719
destruction is not the worst thing that

2516
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,440
you can do so obviously i'm right now

2517
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,280
i've just given a talk about 5g so i'm

2518
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,679
looking at it from the 5g aspect of it

2519
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:32,560
so

2520
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,199
destruction is bad yes of course it's

2521
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:37,600
bad but it's not it's not the the

2522
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,520
tremendous thing that you can do it's

2523
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,040
not the worst thing you can do what is

2524
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,639
much more important especially when

2525
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,880
we're talking about the situation where

2526
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,800
you are in a military operation

2527
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,239
operation is actually to have your

2528
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,320
network infiltrated to actually have

2529
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,480
someone sitting in your communication

2530
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,199
system and being able to understand what

2531
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,800
you're doing what you're planning and

2532
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,960
being and they're with being ahead of

2533
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,040
what you're doing so

2534
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,600
i would actually say that it would be

2535
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,800
diligent to destroy that advantage that

2536
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,960
you've got us as the attacker and take

2537
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,320
that network down that's not what i want

2538
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,159
to do what i want to do is to be in

2539
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,719
there and actually operate covertly so

2540
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,520
i'm looking at especially in terms of 5g

2541
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,600
of cyber conflict of being much more

2542
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,159
covered operations than being actual

2543
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,000
destruction operations and that's one

2544
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,679
that's one of the reasons i can't stress

2545
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,239
this is enough why we need to get ahead

2546
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:29,440
of our

2547
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,560
of our

2548
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,040
opponents to actually

2549
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,239
avoid

2550
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,000
having someone sitting in our

2551
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,400
communication systems and being able to

2552
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,320
to listen to every step that we're

2553
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,440
planning and taking and of course in it

2554
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,520
also in a political sense puts us in a

2555
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,239
bad position um if we have someone in

2556
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,000
our network that is able to say okay i'm

2557
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
gonna for example use ransomware or i'm

2558
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,080
gonna pull the pull the plug which we

2559
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,400
don't have anymore but do it in software

2560
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,719
terms and destroy your communication of

2561
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,320
course that that's something that puts

2562
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
you in a politically bad position

2563
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,400
because it has an effect but i think

2564
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,800
it's not the the worst effect of the

2565
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,159
much more

2566
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,480
difficult or dangerous effect is

2567
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,840
actually the covered operation and i

2568
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,600
think that's something that we are going

2569
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,840
to see in cyber conflict in the very

2570
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,440
near future quite a lot especially with

2571
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,080
the current situation and russia being

2572
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,800
an opponent that is often

2573
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,400
trying to

2574
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,840
operate more covertly than to just use

2575
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,679
pure destruction

2576
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,280
thanks i have a book coming out on that

2577
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280
point just as it so happens

2578
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,600
so um christopher do you have a comment

2579
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,880
a quick comment to make on that or

2580
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,320
you're happy to let go

2581
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,800
i know we're over time so i would simply

2582
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,080
make the point that if we're thinking

2583
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,320
about the future we're you know the

2584
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,719
sources of insecurity for us with these

2585
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,719
emerging technologies out

2586
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,280
a year two years 10 years 20 years

2587
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,520
uh you know they're the same as with

2588
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,520
other information technologies with with

2589
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,960
the internet and cyberspace in

2590
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,880
particular it's you know the human

2591
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,360
factor misdesigned misuse its path

2592
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,520
dependency the circumstances of today

2593
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,600
leading us to make security decisions

2594
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,760
design decisions that will dictate what

2595
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,920
happens tomorrow and it's network

2596
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,239
externalities we can't forget that 5g

2597
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:17,600
artificial intelligence are going to

2598
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,520
change things about society which will

2599
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,360
determine the value propositions of

2600
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,960
different you know modes of cyber

2601
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,960
conflicts in the future such that we

2602
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,520
can't necessarily rely on a lot of these

2603
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,719
assumptions we're throwing back and

2604
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,000
forth which

2605
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,120
you know i know

2606
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,239
you know at least leonard and miguel

2607
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,840
really well we have conversations where

2608
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,040
we throw these assumptions around all

2609
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,400
the time and

2610
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,520
we're not necessarily going to be able

2611
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,920
to rely on them again a decade or two

2612
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,840
decades from now we need to you know

2613
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,000
recognize the learning from the current

2614
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,120
conflict

2615
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,360
um will have distinct implications for

2616
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,080
our security and our insecurity out you

2617
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,080
know that period of time so we

2618
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,320
better learn the right lessons

2619
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,679
thank you very much and thank you for

2620
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,159
indulging my um fairly provocative

2621
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:01,120
question there and i thank you so much

2622
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,600
for all the questions as well and i got

2623
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,960
so excited at the start i've got to

2624
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,239
actually introduce me so if you do want

2625
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,760
to say hello please say hello and i'll

2626
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,560
give you my name then and thank you um

2627
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,440
very much and we'll have some um gifts

2628
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,800
for the

2629
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,239
different speakers but

2630
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:20,000
i'll i'll let you go and enjoy coffee so

2631
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,239
thank you
