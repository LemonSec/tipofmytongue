3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,880
uh survived the excellent dinner last

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,000
night

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,599
um

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,360
when when i first

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,880
i was approached

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,119
to moderate this panel and i saw the

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,080
words

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,439
indo-pacific

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,359
um in the theme then then immediately

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,199
china came up to my mind

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
we've been talking a lot about ukraine

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
during this uh this conference and then

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,760
rightly so

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
but at the same time

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
we're seeing quite many developments

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
happening um in the

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,570
in the pacific um

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,719
[Music]

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,280
area uh we see we kept news about china

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
doing kind of this island hopping

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
trying to get new uh defense agreements

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
with their with different countries

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
and the the big question

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,000
for me

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
is

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
are we missing something

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,719
what what is the role of of cyber and in

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
this domain as

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
as we know also china um having been

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
quite active in in cyber so

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
to talk about this and and some other

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,960

colleagues

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
i guess before i go into

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
our part of the world or our region um

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
what is happening in ukraine uh has

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
shocked uh everyone around the world uh

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
and people around

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,560

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
japan uh and in our neighborhood are

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
shocked as well

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
the existing international order based

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,519
on the rule of law is being challenged

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,200
and the international community must

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
stand up to it

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
anyone who is seeing this any country

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
who is seeing the situation in ukraine

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
must come to understand that

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
the use of force to change the status

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
quo or to use by

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
military means in violation of internal

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
law will not be tolerated

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
and will have consequences

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
china

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
is

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,519
have become an economic power a strong

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
power a military power as well

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
and

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
the security situation in our part of

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
the world has become very difficult uh

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
we feel uh not we feel i mean i think

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
cyber is a realm that reflects

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,400
geopolitical tensions uh in our part in

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
any part of the world

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
and

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
china

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
on its own uh is

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
carrying out activities that are of

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
concern to us uh president biden

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
recently made a visit to tokyo

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
in the

108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
joint statement between our prime

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
minister and the president we expressed

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
concern for many of their activities

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,159
and

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
what is also of concern to us is that

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
china and russia are

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
they have been close but they may be

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,079
even getting closer

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
president putin visited beijing in

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
february uh right before the beijing

118
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,560
winter olympic games

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
their joint statement said

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
their

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,919
friendship has no limits and there are

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,360
no forbidden areas of cooperation um

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
they have on the 24th of may on the day

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,880
that the quad leaders leaders of japan

125
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
the united states australia and india

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
were meeting in tokyo on that specific

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
day

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,680
russia and china jointly flew bombers in

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,919
areas around japan they had only started

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
to do this in 2019 but this was the

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
fourth time that they had carried this

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
out

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
so you can understand the geopolitical

134
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,199
tension that is surrounding

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,320
japan

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,039
and

137
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,160
the cyber realm is where

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
we see increasingly activities that

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
reflect this

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
both nato and japan us alliance

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,320
recognize that cyber attacks could

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
constitute an armed attack

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
but the

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
activities that we see today are below

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,840
the threshold but it is it's more

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,120
challenging to to deal with these uh

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
these malicious cyber activities um and

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
it's it's becoming more challenging for

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
japan i don't want to go on for too long

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
so i'd like to pass the baton over to uh

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
domica

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
yeah um i really appreciate the question

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,240
i think it's a very important one and

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
one that we're wrestling with uh all the

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
time in the department of defense uh our

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
new national defense strategy recognizes

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
that china is the pacing threat and

158
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
while russia and the conflict in ukraine

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
is the acute threat and um

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
is i think what many have acknowledged

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
here the first time that we are seeing

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
uh cyber con in conflict uh there's a

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
lot for us to be learning about what

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,680
this means but at a strategic level the

165
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
key takeaways from

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
the

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
conflict between russia and ukraine

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
is that it is not just a regional

169
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
conflict it is not just of interest to

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
the to nato and the countries in europe

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
it is of interest to countries all over

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
the world and we have seen countries

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
from all over the world recognize that

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
the attempts to deprive ukraine of its

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
sovereignty

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
is something that all of us

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
oppose and so we appreciate the aid

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
provided by japan by australia by others

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
all around the world on the other side

180
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
of the planet

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
this also has tremendous implications

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,400
for potential conflict in the

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
indo-pacific if someone attempts to

184
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
change the existing status quo and

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
self-governance by force i think we have

186
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
been very clear that that is something

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,199
that is unacceptable and that

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
like in ukraine countries will pay a

189
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
very high price for doing that and it

190
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,680
will

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
and there will be a need to be held

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
accountable for any such attempt but as

193
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
we look at this current crisis we are

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
learning many lessons about how we need

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,960
to prepare especially in the cyber

196
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,759
domain to ensure that countries are able

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240
to preserve their self-governance in

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
cyber and in conflict

199
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,880
currently

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
so i think the only the only useful

201
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
thing i can add to that because my

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
colleagues have expressed it so well um

203
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
is how the indo-pacific region um

204
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,000
is is a slightly different problem from

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
a from a cyber domain perspective and

206
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,360
that is because a lot of the you know um

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,400
cutting-edge technology development

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,599
much of it is happening in the

209
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
indo-pacific we have

210
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,199
some very technologically advanced

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,400
neighbours

212
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
and of course china is a technological

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
powerhouse

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
that means that

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
in addition to

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,919
you know the traditional methods of

217
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
warfare that we would expect in in

218
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
conflict and again no one no one wants

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,240
to see conflict in the indo-pacific um

220
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
but in addition to that they have a lot

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,039
of other levers they can pull and it

222
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
means that

223
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
conflict can look a little different or

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
at least it needs to be taken in that

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
broader context now i know i'm repeating

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
things that many others

227
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
have said during this conference

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
but you know cyber cyber conflict isn't

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
one angle uh in in conflict in the

230
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,879
indo-pacific um

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,399
china

232
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
uh

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
there is there is no one more interested

234
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
in spying on and manipulating the

235
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
chinese than the chinese communist party

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,560
and that means they are very practiced

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
in

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
certain types of

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,040
state monitoring

240
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
it makes them very very competent at

241
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
applying things like social credit

242
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
system and applying new and advancing

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
technologies such as facial recognition

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
um technology drone-based warfare

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
they're investing

246
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
enormous amounts into advanced

247
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
technologies such as ai have a major

248
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
driver in that space to develop

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
with managing an enormous population

250
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
industrial upgrades and a very large

251
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
military

252
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,399
from a quantum perspective they

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,800
in 2020 they invested

254
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
more money than the next uh

255
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
five i believe um competitors in the

256
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
quantum space so they invested more

257
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,160
money cumulatively than

258
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
uh germany france the united states and

259
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
the eu combined

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
that is a lot of investment in advanced

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,519
technology

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,240
and and what is capable when when you

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
are practiced and have invested a lot in

264
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
that technological space

265
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
is that

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
it's not just a matter of

267
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,240
um

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
you know

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
cyber attacks as we are currently used

270
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
to them it is also

271
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,720
um the use of authoritarian direction on

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,600
technology companies that are worldwide

273
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
and so the integration of technology

274
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,560
that is dictated or directed by a

275
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
certain government um being implemented

276
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
in critical infrastructure worldwide

277
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
and again we've spoken about supply

278
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
chains the need to understand what kind

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
of technology is where what capabilities

280
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,399
are where

281
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,279
and

282
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,079
you know

283
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
technology such as for example

284
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,120
language translation when you combine

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
organizations who are particularly

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,120
interested in disinformation

287
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
misinformation

288
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
uh investing in this kind of technology

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,399
and then embedding it into systems and

290
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,760
deploying that around the world where we

291
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
aren't sure where it is it means that it

292
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
becomes very very hard to manage

293
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,079
misinformation

294
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,360
and disinformation and censorship so

295
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,839
the the breadth of cyber

296
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,000
um campaign is quite broad um with when

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
you're working with highly sophisticated

298
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
technology adversaries and there is a

299
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,920
lot of risk in the indo-pacific which um

300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
as as we have the majority of the

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
world's semi-conductors manufactured in

302
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,519
uh taiwan and south korea in china and

303
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
in america

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
um without chips we have no tech so

305
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
being able to make sure that we are

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,519
protecting our neighbours that we're

307
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,720
protecting

308
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
our technological freedom and how that

309
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
is going to be directed that we're

310
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
protecting

311
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,959
standards in a way

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,560
that um they adhere to to principles

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,160
that we all agree to um that are open

314
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,279
fair transparent um and that adhere to

315
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,000
international uh rules based orders

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
so

317
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
there is there is a lot at risk in the

318
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
technical domain in this space and it's

319
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,839
a

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,959
you know

321
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
again we've spoken a lot about the

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
ukraine and russia and i can i extend my

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
respects to the ukrainians here today to

324
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,240
everyone who has

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
dealt with and has to live in countries

326
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,639
that have faced russian aggression and

327
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
to those of you who fight back um

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,399
you know it is humbling your bravery and

329
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,839
engagement and

330
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,200
it's again on the other side of the

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,959
world we find it difficult to figure out

332
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,040
what we can do in this space

333
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
so please let us know

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,480
again

335
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
there's additional additional threats

336
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,839
that i think it's worth also continuing

337
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,600
to look at at the same time as they

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,079
learn from russia

339
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,480
thank you so much i wanted to clarify

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,519
one one aspect here and uh

341
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
yeah you mentioned um the the quads and

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,399
and the quad recently also had at the

343
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,519
summit

344
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
um and all of the countries also pledged

345
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
50 billion dollars for the

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
infrastructure

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
are there any implications also on on

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
on the cyber or how how we can

349
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,800
how quad wants to defend

350
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
or invest here

351
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,600
quad

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
is a

353
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
a a framework of four like-minded

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,959
countries that wants to promote uh

355
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
international order based on the rule of

356
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
law fundamental values that we all share

357
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
um and

358
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
we are

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,839
saying that we would like to promote

360
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,279
what we call the free and open in the

361
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,959
pacific which is international order

362
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
based on the existing international i

363
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,440
mean where we where we are now

364
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
and we would like to do good deeds

365
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
within the region and even beyond uh and

366
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
50 billion dollars uh investment in the

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
infrastructure project

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
the vaccines that we will be promoting

369
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
uh the

370
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,040
cyber

371
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
security sphere where we would cooperate

372
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
and we would cooperate to provide

373
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
technical assistance to countries in the

374
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
region

375
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
we cyber

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
of course is one of the areas that we

377
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
would like to do good deeds within the

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
region

379
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
50 billion dollars is more for

380
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
infrastructure but but cyborg is

381
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
obviously included in the things that we

382
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
would like to carry out yeah i think one

383
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,839
of the

384
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,320
keys when we think about the quad and

385
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,959
cyber is all of our commitments to the

386
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
free and open internet and the cyber

387
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
domain i really appreciate our

388
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
lithuanian colleagues who've done deep

389
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
technical analysis of chinese products

390
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
and discovered that chinese censorship

391
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,480
tools are hardwired into the products

392
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
that they sell throughout the world the

393
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
four of

394
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,279
the four countries are committed to a

395
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,279
different vision of technology a

396
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,800
multi-stakeholder

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
free and open environment and i think

398
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
many of our european colleagues share

399
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
that view

400
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,240
and so as we think about how to contest

401
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
the increasing digital authoritarianism

402
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,320
i think the quad and the conversations

403
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,680
that we have there become increasingly

404
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
important

405
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
and if i can add to that too you know

406
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,880
with um relationships like the quad and

407
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
with orcus and with asean and and a

408
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,040
bunch of the other relationships that we

409
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
have around the world that are that are

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
beyond nato um

411
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
the point of those is not to be

412
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
exclusive it's it's to

413
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
pull some threads and try things um

414
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
based on existing relationships that

415
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
have worked say in the five eyes domain

416
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
and in bilateral relationship that we've

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
always had with japan with india

418
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
and to to pull together different groups

419
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
to try some things out based on existing

420
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,680
trust that has been built over decades

421
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
and then to bring people in

422
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
um and i think that's that's a key

423
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
message that that we need to make very

424
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
clear that we're not here to be

425
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,680
exclusive um we're here to

426
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
enhance the edition the you know and

427
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,959
provide additional effort on top of

428
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
what's already happening in the nato

429
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
community and so

430
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,240
we would really like um you know to

431
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
to start exercising some of the issues

432
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
that we have around trust around data

433
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
around infrastructure around people

434
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
and the challenges that we face

435
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
particularly in the indo-pacific region

436
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
around technology around climate change

437
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,040
again is a key message that's come out

438
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
of the quad because you know a number of

439
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
our neighbors the the drivers for them

440
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
are not the same as as they are for us

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
or at least

442
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,800
you know they're they're struggling to

443
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
survive in a world or worry about the

444
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
future of their countries their cultures

445
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,279
um in a world where you know the island

446
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
nations may be underwater in five years

447
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
now that aspect of survival you know

448
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
changes the equation in terms of where

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,079
their vulnerabilities might be and where

450
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,920
their priority is going to go in terms

451
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,279
of cyber support so we

452
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,240
you know

453
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,199
our role in the region is not to come

454
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
and protect everyone from

455
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
um big bad outside forces it's to help

456
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
these countries protect themselves

457
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
and so the concept of

458
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,560
um helping vulnerable nations uh build

459
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
their own cyber capacity is really

460
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,279
critical

461
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,240
if we you know when when cyber security

462
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,839
really is only as good as its weakest

463
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,000
link if we're able to smooth out that

464
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,279
attack service

465
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,839
regionally and give attackers nowhere to

466
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,040
latch onto

467
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,759
then it reduces the noise when if it

468
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
comes to conflict

469
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
it increases trust

470
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
we have difficult time trusting people

471
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
or building trusted relationships if

472
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
their networks are being owned or if

473
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
they're being manipulated so we can

474
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
build trust in that space

475
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
and it allows us and buys us time to

476
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
plan rather than to react when we're

477
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,039
under pressure

478
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,839
so

479
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,439
working with countries to build that

480
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
cyber capacity for themselves to

481
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,559
maintain their sovereignty their ability

482
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,119
to self-govern and and their

483
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,400
resilience um in in a cyber domain which

484
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
in a lot of cases is

485
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,439
um

486
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,280
almost extraneous to their to their

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
driving needs at the moment to to be

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,120
competitive and to survive um and to

489
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
thrive in the modern world

490
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,679
so

491
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,120
um again the the goal is really to to

492
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
try things out to see what works to

493
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
bring people in and and to do it in a

494
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,400
way that that

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
you know adheres to those international

496
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,520
um you know rules-based law

497
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,480
and and do it together

498
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
and still

499
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,400
we heard from jonah we were a couple of

500
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
days ago

501
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
about

502
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
the number of democratic countries the

503
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,360
number of undemocratic countries

504
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
my question here would be are our

505
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,400
policies working in that

506
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,039
from my daily job when we deal with the

507
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,840
capacity building projects or we're

508
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
discussing coordinating different

509
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
projects

510
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
i don't see that that

511
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,240
we are

512
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
really kind of leveraging what we do in

513
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,799
these countries we are not leveraging

514
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,520
these projects to become a kind of

515
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
political

516
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
mind shift in this country so

517
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,799
maybe to put you on the spot clearly um

518
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
what are we doing wrong then well i mean

519
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
i think in in certain cases it's about

520
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
making sure that we're we're asking

521
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
questions and doing it respectfully um

522
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
that we we understand um again where

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
some of these nations are coming from

524
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
and what they're vulnerable to but also

525
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
understand that

526
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
no one wants

527
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,039
no one wants other countries to come in

528
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,240
and dictate how things are going to go

529
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
for them and no one wants to open doors

530
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,799
and allow in attackers to manipulate

531
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,760
their population uh and no one really

532
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,320
wants to seed sovereignty and their own

533
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,760
national resilience neither do we

534
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
so i think

535
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
making sure that we provide them with

536
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
options and alternatives in the region i

537
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
mean china again technological

538
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,039
powerhouse is able to go out and sell

539
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,280
really sexy sounding solutions to a lot

540
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
of these nations um and

541
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
and those nations

542
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
they're not stupid they know what the

543
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
costs are

544
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,559
um to to engaging and what we try to do

545
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,640
is provide an alternative that

546
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,520
um

547
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
you know

548
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,720
protects some some more of those values

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
that they hold true so

550
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,280
i think it's about an ongoing ability to

551
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,080
build trust and to to also expose um to

552
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
people in our own countries because our

553
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
own people are just as vulnerable to

554
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
manipulation and disinformation as as

555
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,360
people in other countries um expose and

556
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,960
shine daylight and fresh air on

557
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
um

558
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,720
you know cyber attacks and and you know

559
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
cases where we've got

560
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
demonstrable manipulation coercive

561
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
diplomacy being applied pressure

562
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
that that does reduce people's ability

563
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
to be sovereign

564
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,960
and make sure that those

565
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,679
cases are clear and so if

566
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,039
you know these countries are able to

567
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,720
make a conscious and educated decision

568
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,559
about what they choose to invest in and

569
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,799
then it honestly it is up to them

570
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
but we we provide an alternative that

571
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
aligns with a set of rules that we need

572
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
to both adhere to be transparent about

573
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
and also walk the walk on

574
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,360
any additions

575
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,039
hey not on the quad

576
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
all right um

577
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,679
um next point that that

578
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,760
could be a bit more

579
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
sexier topic in within within cyber and

580
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
and china

581
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,120
is um

582
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
what do you think what is

583
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
what is china right now

584
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,760
learning

585
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,559
from

586
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,840
russia's cyber activities in ukraine

587
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,799
yeah or the whole conflict how how would

588
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,320
that kind of

589
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,679
um

590
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,720
inform

591
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
their policies

592
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
yeah

593
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
so

594
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
what the chinese are actually learning i

595
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
think um

596
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,960
we would have to ask them but i do think

597
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
that there are some important lessons

598
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
that they can be observing from this

599
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
conflict that are very important for us

600
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
to understand when it comes to fighting

601
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,600
in the indo-pacific

602
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
first is that it is much it is difficult

603
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
to change the strategic orientation of

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
the defender by cyber means

605
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,360
that if the defender is committed to its

606
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,039
own self-governance and territorial

607
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,159
integrity

608
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,880
cyber disruption does not change that

609
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
strategic perspective and that it is

610
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,559
much harder

611
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,799
to

612
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
force a the defender to give that up

613
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,039
even with kinetic means

614
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,400
the other thing that they should be

615
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,760
learning is that

616
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
their estimates of how long and how

617
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
difficult this conflict might be

618
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,480
may be off russia very clearly thought

619
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
this would be much easier

620
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
to take the entirety of ukraine than

621
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
they expected their own analysis and

622
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
their own their assessments of their own

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,919
capabilities were off

624
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,640
in an authoritarian system

625
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,200
where disagreement and bringing bad news

626
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
to your leadership

627
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,159
is something to be punished and not

628
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,200
something

629
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,240
to be taken in as a opportunity for

630
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
improvement

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,320
the chances that you are not being told

632
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,799
accurately whether or not you are ready

633
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,320
to fight are quite high

634
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
and that is a real challenge for china

635
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,640
the other thing that i think is really

636
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,159
important to understand and this is a

637
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
challenge for all of us is that a

638
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
history of cyber attacks

639
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,919
prepares the defender to be resilient in

640
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,600
the face of them

641
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
and ukraine has been tested

642
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
and

643
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
other countries

644
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
other partners have provided assistance

645
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
to their cyber defense

646
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
for a very long time

647
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
and how we think about shoring up the

648
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,000
cyber defenses and improving the

649
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
resilience of countries in the

650
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
indo-pacific region is something that we

651
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
need to do with alacrity lessons learned

652
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,400
from this conflict about the importance

653
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
of resilience the structures that are

654
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,960
needed to maintain insight into your

655
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,640
national networks to be able to

656
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,720
remediate those things quickly to know

657
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
what help you need from the outside

658
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
world these are all very important

659
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,640
lessons that we are learning right now

660
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,480
but this conflict is still ongoing so i

661
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
am hesitant to say exactly what those

662
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,559
lessons are

663
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,559
because there can be further turns in

664
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
this conflict our insights into exactly

665
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,360
what has happened in the cyber domain

666
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
is still evolving as we learn more from

667
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
the private sector from the ukrainians

668
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,760
themselves and even i think as we may

669
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
learn more from russia about how

670
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
restrained or unrestrained they have

671
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
been in this conflict

672
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
in the cyber domain

673
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,799
so i think that there's a lot that we

674
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,320
can learn and a lot that we need to

675
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,799
think about preparing

676
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
in the indo-pacific so that countries

677
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,520
there are also prepared to preserve

678
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
their sovereignty and their territorial

679
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
integrity

680
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,760
i completely agree with uh what mika

681
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
just said i mean exactly what china is

682
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
learning you really have to ask the

683
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,559
chinese but what we can see

684
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
from the conflict in ukraine is what she

685
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,679
had just talked about especially in the

686
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,400
cybersphere is cyber resiliency i am

687
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
just

688
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,520
impressed at the the how the ukrainians

689
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
are supposed to are able to maintain all

690
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the major critical infrastructure within

691
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
their own territory to continue to

692
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,679
provide

693
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,520
services to their cell phones and their

694
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,400
their

695
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
sns accounts are all very active and and

696
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,679
it's it's like how are they doing this

697
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,440
we have one earthquake and we you know

698
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
we we have one

699
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
uh we could have a electric power plant

700
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
down but they have a war going on uh

701
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,279
when they have a

702
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,440
continuous cyber attacks which they are

703
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
resisting um and so

704
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,360
for the lessons we can learn from what

705
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
the situation in our part of the world

706
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,559
would be to have

707
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,640
to enhance and then continue to enhance

708
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,559
cyber security and to have cyber

709
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,760
resilience

710
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
uh at the same time i guess it will be

711
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,760
just a little bit off uh

712
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
we come above ground

713
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,679
we saw in the united nations that over

714
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,480
140 countries voted to condemn russia

715
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,960
for their uh aggression against ukraine

716
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,320
so that's 140 out of 193 you may think

717
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
that you know we're missing 50 but that

718
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,640
that's three quarters of the countries

719
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,559
around the world are united uh in

720
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,039
opposing this unilateral aggression in

721
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,520
clear violation of international law uh

722
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
and the economic sanctions that we are

723
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
all imposing on them the g7 is leading

724
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,640
that uh that effort uh and

725
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,559
the the the

726
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,200
financial costs to uh russia and their

727
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
economy uh is substantial uh and i think

728
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
as i said at the beginning we must make

729
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
sure that any country watching or

730
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,520
following this conflict must take away

731
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
go away with the

732
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
lesson that this cannot be repeated or

733
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,600
that they should not be trying this kind

734
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,039
of an effort

735
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
so

736
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,679
is my translation now correct saying

737
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,640
that

738
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,360
the ukrainian resilience and

739
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,400
somewhat chaotic russian activities are

740
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
right now deterring also

741
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,159
china to take further actions against

742
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,159
taiwan

743
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
to quote joe and lie as we saw earlier

744
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,159
too soon to tell

745
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
um but i do think uh

746
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,400
any country that is thinking about

747
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,039
changing self-governance by force by

748
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
changing the existing status quo by

749
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,039
force

750
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,039
needs to be wary of the consequences

751
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,520
globally for doing so

752
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,880
and especially

753
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,760
a country that is as intertwined in the

754
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,600
global economy that have so many

755
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
leverage points

756
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
that countries could say i am no longer

757
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
interested in doing business with you

758
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
i'm no longer interested in supplying

759
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,559
you with

760
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,640
whatever

761
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,320
those are high prices to pay um aside

762
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,840
from the fact that it could be

763
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,159
incredibly embarrassing for the country

764
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,679
that is attempting

765
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
uh to take

766
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
by force um thinking that they are the

767
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
stronger power in fact turning out to be

768
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
not as capable and demonstrating that

769
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,360
weakness on the global stage

770
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
i mean the

771
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
i completely agree i think

772
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,559
the

773
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,840
the fact that china will attempt to

774
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
reunify

775
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
taiwan into china is not up for debate

776
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
they have been very clear about that for

777
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,159
decades that they believe that taiwan is

778
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,760
part of china

779
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
i think the question is how and what

780
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,559
we've learned from russia is really

781
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,159
that doing that by force is really not

782
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,919
an option for them if they want to

783
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,399
preserve peace and again as you've said

784
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
not embarrass themselves in the face of

785
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
hundreds of countries that are going to

786
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
um argue that that is not an appropriate

787
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,678
way of of working in the region

788
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,919
i guess one of the leverages that that

789
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,720
we have and and the chinese leadership

790
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,159
has also

791
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,120
kind of

792
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
voiced it out is that

793
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
we have

794
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
huge kind of economic ties with china

795
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
and china is also interested in keeping

796
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
these economic ties and we saw that

797
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,559
that's in the debate

798
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
about the sanctions against russia and

799
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,600
chinese seem to be quite wary about that

800
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
um

801
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,120
my next question here would be

802
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
so if we see

803
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,720
see or try to interpret what china is is

804
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
is learning from

805
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,960
the conflicts or russia's war against

806
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
ukraine

807
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,799
what are the lessons for us

808
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,279
how to deal with china tomorrow and day

809
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
after tomorrow

810
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,600
yeah

811
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,440
i think that as

812
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,679
we think about

813
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
global technology development and

814
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,559
adoption

815
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,159
i think um

816
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,880
we need to think carefully about what

817
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
adoption of chinese technology might

818
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
mean you know i think that for a long

819
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,240
time there was a you know the 90s were

820
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,760
very optimistic to turn through

821
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
entanglement

822
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,520
that we would have entwined economies

823
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,240
and that would prevent conflict

824
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
but largely the entanglement has gone

825
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
one way um we have not seen

826
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,799
the same adoption of chinese of western

827
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,159
technologies within china

828
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,480
and i think that that poses a challenge

829
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
but as we think about and as some people

830
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,200
i think

831
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
are

832
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
see the appeal of adoption of chinese

833
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,600
technology platforms based on cost and

834
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
all the rest of that um

835
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
it may feel cheaper in the moment but

836
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,559
the long-term security costs to being

837
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,480
able to ensure that you have control

838
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,880
over your network that your network is

839
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
not part of a censorship apparatus for

840
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,159
another in another country's interest

841
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
and not your own i think are things that

842
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,360
countries have to consider

843
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,480
very carefully when when considering

844
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,640
that offer um

845
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
it does not have to be that you know

846
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
there is confrontation here but i think

847
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
we have to figure out how

848
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
um we can

849
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,679
uh

850
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,399
shape uh ensure that china is playing by

851
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,760
global rules

852
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,960
um that are consistent and preserve the

853
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,559
allow countries to preserve their own

854
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,080
self-governance

855
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,480
and not be coerced

856
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,519
either explicitly through economic means

857
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,600
or implicitly through the technology

858
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,519
they have adopted

859
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,679
to someone else's national security

860
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
interest

861
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
again i agree with what mika just said

862
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,320
and also

863
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
i guess in terms of what we would

864
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,320
like to do is to deter uh

865
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,240
action uh meaning

866
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
not just in cyberspace but just to deter

867
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,799
any activity by the chinese that will

868
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,880
will change the status quo uh in our

869
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,960
part of the world which they are in east

870
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,000
china sea uh doing uh on a daily basis

871
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,159
and then making unlawful maritime claims

872
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,320
in the in south china sea

873
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
they are becoming they they are

874
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
challenging what we would call the

875
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,840
existing international order uh and i

876
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,200
think

877
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,720
as mika just said there are risks to uh

878
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,440
the the economic influence of china is

879
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
just global

880
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
they are the second largest economy in

881
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
the world uh and we are 20 of japan's

882
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,840
trade is with china but we must make

883
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,679
sure that uh

884
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,760
the the important uh infrastructure that

885
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,240
we rely on or be it in the cybersphere

886
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
or in the physical sphere

887
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
are reliable we just enact the new

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,880
legislation on economic security

889
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
where

890
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,120
and if we would designate uh certain

891
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
industries as critical infrastructure

892
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,720
industries and if they're going to make

893
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,000
a major procurement they will uh submit

894
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,919
the proposal to the government we will

895
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,320
only review and we will only advise but

896
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
make sure that they are uh we would make

897
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
sure that they are from trusted vendors

898
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
uh and i think

899
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
um

900
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
one you know

901
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
it's it's important to

902
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,559
maintain our

903
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,840
international order the way we

904
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,440
live continue to enjoy the economic

905
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,919
successes that we have had uh at the

906
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,559
same time not be too reliant on uh

907
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,080
on

908
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,960
products that are not reliable and so

909
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,200
that that we would be at the at the

910
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
mercy of a certain

911
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
untrusted vendor

912
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
i would just like to add i we really

913
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,279
appreciate that japan has taken the step

914
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,679
because as we think about capacity

915
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,200
building with other countries and we

916
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,799
think about increased

917
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,399
cooperation in the cyber domain

918
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,399
whether or not a country's networks are

919
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
trusted

920
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,360
is a key factor in how far cyber

921
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
security cooperation with the united

922
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,960
states can go

923
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,039
if we have concerns

924
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,000
that the networks are vulnerable

925
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
have been compromised it makes it very

926
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,919
difficult for us in the u.s to share

927
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,720
sensitive or classified information

928
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,760
with another country so this is a real

929
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,840
challenge as countries think about these

930
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
networks

931
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
typically you know when you think about

932
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,279
your information technology networks you

933
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
don't think about the national security

934
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
implications but if someone else is able

935
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
to turn off or route traffic on your

936
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
networks differently than you would

937
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,320
choose to if they are able to

938
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,719
collect in bulk the traffic on it that

939
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,119
poses a real challenge

940
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,079
to our ability to share because the last

941
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,000
thing that we want when we are trying to

942
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
plan and coordinate together activities

943
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
in the national security arena is to

944
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,239
have adversaries sitting inside that

945
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
communication

946
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,199
i'm like can i be slightly controversial

947
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,480
at this point i don't feel like i've

948
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
said anything controversial so far i

949
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,599
mean we need to prepare the audience

950
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,960
also for the questions

951
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
yes controversial the not controversial

952
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,079
part is again could not agree more i

953
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,399
think the extension to

954
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
um to what we've just heard is that

955
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,680
any conflict um with advanced

956
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
sophisticated advanced technological

957
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,079
powers such as china or anyone else

958
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,119
is that

959
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,720
it is not

960
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,280
contained to a military versus military

961
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,599
argument right this is not where the

962
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,440
bounds of that fight is going to happen

963
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,320
and we can expect to see ongoing gray

964
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,400
zone um engagement and conflict um as as

965
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,880
we are currently facing now so

966
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,359
it is tempting to to look at conflict

967
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
and say the defense is going to to

968
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,520
handle it and i think

969
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
you know

970
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,400
conflict with

971
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
um in cyberspace is one of those

972
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,359
here's the first controversial part

973
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,440
defense is uniquely not qualified to

974
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
fight that on their own

975
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
we know that public private partnerships

976
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,520
have been really successful in ukraine

977
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
we know that there's there's problems

978
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,960
with getting enough skilling and and um

979
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,200
staff to who can work in the cyber

980
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,359
domain but one of the reasons that

981
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,760
defense can't do it on its own and this

982
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,520
is not anything to do with their

983
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
capabilities defense is probably able to

984
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,599
to protect defense if they're very very

985
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
good they're able to protect defence and

986
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,160
a bunch of government departments

987
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,200
but we also have people in our countries

988
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,280
who are individuals and who have small

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
businesses and who fall below the

990
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,280
threshold of what a state can afford to

991
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,359
to support and yet we owe them

992
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,079
protection we owe them protection that's

993
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,119
a little bit why they pay taxes so

994
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,079
uh

995
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,240
we we need to be able to deal with the

996
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,960
fact that today we are those those

997
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,040
people are having their lives destroyed

998
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,200
and their livelihoods ruined um and are

999
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,400
being manipulated um by by foreign

1000
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,440
actors

1001
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
and

1002
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
and our response to that probably needs

1003
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,040
to not be focused on it in a narrow

1004
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
space i mean

1005
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,240
the controversial part which i will say

1006
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
now is that we tend to get wrapped

1007
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
around the axle a little bit about whose

1008
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
responsibility it is

1009
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,320
depending on the activity and it is

1010
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,960
arguably unhelpful to do that so

1011
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,720
traditionally i mean we all have secrets

1012
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,320
we all have intelligence communities

1013
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
that that have you know information they

1014
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,240
protect and have sovereign interests

1015
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,599
that they'll protect and that is good

1016
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,560
and right and we all agree to that

1017
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,520
but

1018
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,599
we get caught um

1019
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,839
usually in a policy domain about what is

1020
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,480
coming from offshore and what is onshore

1021
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
and what's domestic and of course in

1022
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,680
cyberspace

1023
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,560
sure is largely irrelevant

1024
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
which means that the division of of

1025
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
effort that we

1026
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,079
have inherited from many years working

1027
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,480
in an intelligent space

1028
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
tires in knots so is this is this an

1029
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,000
intelligence problem is a security

1030
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,599
problem is it a military problem is it a

1031
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,599
domestic security problem is it a law

1032
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,160
enforcement problem and and

1033
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,920
and the answer is it doesn't matter

1034
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,599
those groups need to be working together

1035
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,760
is it is it a cyber security industry

1036
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
who cares

1037
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
we have to be able to get around this

1038
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,920
issue and make sure that we're getting

1039
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,280
the right people to deal with the fact

1040
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,040
that they're all attacks

1041
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,560
and that we do need to protect our

1042
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,960
people as much as we need to protect the

1043
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,040
institutions that that they have either

1044
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,560
voted in or that that run their country

1045
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,839
so

1046
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,760
it's a it's a difficult space to figure

1047
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,079
out we will always have information that

1048
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
we need to be able to protect and we all

1049
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,880
have the sovereignty uh and the need to

1050
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,640
make sure that we're all individually

1051
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,119
resilient i think the trick is

1052
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,000
finding a way to share what we can share

1053
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,520
and going beyond sharing because the

1054
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,040
reality is also sharing is not

1055
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
sufficient we need to actually build

1056
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
something that is greater than the sum

1057
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,680
of the parts and that means we need to

1058
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,200
build something together in a

1059
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,599
collaborative way but not in this naive

1060
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
collaborative way that's like we're this

1061
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,880
utopia where we're all magically going

1062
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
to open up and give everything that we

1063
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
have to everyone else because that's not

1064
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,280
going to happen

1065
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,920
but we can look at building systems you

1066
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,839
know in a world where we talk about xero

1067
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
trust and we talk about

1068
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,680
trust but verify we can trust our

1069
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,800
partners but verify and expose the right

1070
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,160
information that is going to provide the

1071
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
right context but we need to exercise

1072
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,079
the policy and get the policy issues

1073
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,079
sorted out both domestically and

1074
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,480
internationally to be able to do that

1075
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,560
it is also quite interesting uh as you

1076
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
mentioned that the public private

1077
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
partnership and i would even widen that

1078
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,400
it's not

1079
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
about partnership with them with the

1080
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,280
industry

1081
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,160
but what what we have seen

1082
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
in in ukraine

1083
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,760
besides the the new role of of big tech

1084
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
companies

1085
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
are also these vigilante groups that are

1086
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,359
completely and uncontrollable

1087
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,560
um

1088
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
and my my last question before we go to

1089
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,560
the audience um questions

1090
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,599
is what do you think what is china how

1091
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,839
is china looking at at these kind of

1092
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,920
developments because these are kind of

1093
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,560
new elements in in cyber world and cyber

1094
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,839
warfare

1095
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,440
yeah

1096
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,000
i think the

1097
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,440
call to arms for volunteers that

1098
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
in the cyber domain that has happened

1099
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,440
here is a complicating factor and it's

1100
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
very difficult for us to assess the

1101
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,520
overall impact of that activity um on

1102
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,599
russia's military capability

1103
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,200
and what kind of assistance that has

1104
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,000
provided to ukraine

1105
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
likewise i think we have all known for

1106
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
quite some time that there are a large

1107
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,960
number of non-state actors within russia

1108
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
that have

1109
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
varying degrees of relationship with the

1110
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
government

1111
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,240
in cyber crime and they you know how

1112
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,440
they are used in the russian system

1113
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
they they pose this sort of hybrid

1114
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,640
threat

1115
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,160
um

1116
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
we saw in the microsoft hafnium incident

1117
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,560
and this was part of the u.s attribution

1118
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,040
statement about that activity was that

1119
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,480
there was certain an ungoverned

1120
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,880
ecosystem in china taking advantage of

1121
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,720
that exploit and that was actually quite

1122
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,000
problematic

1123
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,560
we had not seen typically and we don't

1124
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,640
see the same kind of criminal actors the

1125
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,880
sort of scope and scale that we see in

1126
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,480
russia operating out of china that china

1127
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,280
has announced that they um are against

1128
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,560
cryptocurrency processing on their

1129
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
territory so the availability of

1130
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
non-state actors

1131
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
in china is different they obviously are

1132
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
a country that puts an emphasis on

1133
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,079
control

1134
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,960
but how they would have to deal with

1135
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,480
non-state actors if they were to try and

1136
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,040
change the status quo by force and and

1137
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,520
take on this very aggressive unprovoked

1138
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
affront to

1139
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,960
uh the international rules based order

1140
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,359
um i think that it's something else that

1141
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,000
uh uh an aggressor nation would have to

1142
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,720
consider reconsider

1143
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
not only

1144
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,560
the non-state actor hackers

1145
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,119
but the non-state actor

1146
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,000
industry responses that might happen as

1147
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,760
you have seen as we have seen in the

1148
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,720
russia ukraine context com western

1149
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,119
companies withdrawing their services

1150
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,480
from russia

1151
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,000
in response to sanction in as a protest

1152
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,880
to the activity itself or in response to

1153
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,839
criminal act criminal laws imposed by

1154
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,359
russia against the kind of things that

1155
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,359
were core to their business model this

1156
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,920
is another complicating factor for how a

1157
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,839
conflict with china might play out that

1158
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,040
is outside of specific government

1159
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,160
direction

1160
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,079
and so i think that these things are

1161
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,599
things that we will all study and if

1162
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,960
they're academics here we look forward

1163
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,359
to your analysis um

1164
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,720
but i think these are important lessons

1165
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
for all of us to understand and analyze

1166
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,480
going forward

1167
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,800
do you add anything or could i can i

1168
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,440
make a speculation

1169
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,400
i'll write it down so uh next year we'll

1170
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,960
quote me on it

1171
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
one of the interesting things about

1172
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,400
quantum computing

1173
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,160
is not that it's here today although we

1174
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,359
can do certain amount of quantum

1175
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,800
computing today

1176
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
and and the threat has always been well

1177
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,079
it's going to break

1178
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,440
you know most of the public key

1179
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
cryptography and the cryptography we

1180
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,720
depend on for our security today

1181
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,240
but one of the interesting things about

1182
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,680
the fact that it's coming

1183
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,839
um is really trying to guess how far

1184
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,319
away it is because

1185
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,880
at some stage it is entirely possible to

1186
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
harvest data now

1187
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,280
um hold it and then decrypt it when the

1188
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
quantum computers are ready

1189
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,839
so

1190
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,920
if someone were to invest a lot of money

1191
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,599
in quantum computing

1192
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,480
and if they had an appetite for stealing

1193
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,079
people's cheese

1194
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,319
then you can probably suggest that there

1195
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,079
would be groups who would be happy to

1196
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,000
harvest data

1197
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,880
and sell it to the highest bidder who

1198
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,319
would be

1199
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,839
potentially thinking of that as an

1200
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,359
intelligence opportunity for the future

1201
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,240
hypothetically speaking

1202
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,359
um are there any hypothetical questions

1203
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,680
from the audience

1204
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,560
uh first here and then i saw him there

1205
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
also

1206
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
and please pose your question as a

1207
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,520
question

1208
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
thanks

1209
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
i will try to keep it short um so katie

1210
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,480
question to you very good points you

1211
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
made there jumping to solutions what

1212
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,440
would you say are good approaches

1213
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,599
to reach out to china on a diplomatic

1214
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,040
level and give them a hand to save their

1215
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,960
pace and

1216
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,440
yes try to bring this conflict to an end

1217
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,960
more or less in a

1218
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,680
peaceful way because i guess they will

1219
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,839
be quite interested in that given that

1220
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,440
they are heavily investing in their belt

1221
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,160
and road initiative

1222
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,319
i'm going to defer that to people with

1223
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,920
diplomatic experience as opposed to

1224
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,680
people with technical experience about

1225
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,440
how how we could use that path um

1226
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
i think the

1227
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,000
for us what is extremely important is

1228
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
we're not seeking confrontation

1229
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
we are seeking

1230
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,000
as we often say in many of our

1231
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,440
declarations peace and stability uh

1232
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,520
of the taiwan strait and that the the

1233
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,079
straight issues need to be resolved

1234
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,200
peacefully

1235
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,599
and we are all

1236
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,440
japan and the u.s both in australia as

1237
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
well we are always having dialogue or we

1238
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,960
are seeking dialogue with china to say

1239
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,359
we have issues that we would like to

1240
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,119
raise we have concerns about what you

1241
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,040
are doing in east china sea south china

1242
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,760
sea your uh economic coercion measures

1243
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,960
these are some but at the same time as i

1244
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,119
said we both have very strong economic

1245
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,920
ties with china and we want

1246
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,280
to have a constructive relationship and

1247
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,960
work on global issues of mutual interest

1248
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,480
uh we are

1249
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,319
trying to establish that kind of a

1250
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,480
relationship but we are not what we are

1251
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,079
trying what we are

1252
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,720
adamantly against is a

1253
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,839
an order where the strong dictates what

1254
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,440
the weak should do

1255
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,640
or the the in their sphere of influence

1256
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,160
that they get to do whatever they want

1257
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,480
to do uh uh

1258
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,839
ignoring the the the norms that we have

1259
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,680
the rules and the laws that we have

1260
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,200
established over

1261
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,319
over many years uh and so that

1262
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,760
we i think

1263
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,040
it is for

1264
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,960
uh the uh

1265
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,280
it is as much on the part of the chinese

1266
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,440
as it is on the part of us to be able to

1267
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
have that kind of a constructive

1268
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,960
relationship

1269
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
i would just say before we can get to

1270
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,160
what we would discuss we would have to

1271
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,640
have a commitment to a discussion

1272
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,000
and so i would encourage the chinese to

1273
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,040
welcome

1274
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,680
the chance to have these conversations

1275
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,480
at all levels

1276
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,079
we had a question here in front

1277
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,200
president

1278
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,240
and then

1279
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
we'll go back there

1280
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,440
uh thank you the uh in the

1281
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,520
basic with the rise of the digital era

1282
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,359
regional groupings such as the north

1283
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,280
atlantic treaty organization that

1284
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,079
obviously by definition cannot have

1285
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,640
uh japan or south korea

1286
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,520
uh or australia in it becomes kind of

1287
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,839
irrelevant thailand torino toronto

1288
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,160
topeka tokyo and taipei are all

1289
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,720
the same same distance

1290
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,760
uh from each other or from an adversary

1291
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,040
and apt 28 and 29 don't care about

1292
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,720
whether it's the u.s

1293
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,640
state department or it's the dutch

1294
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,200
foreign ministry or the bundestag that

1295
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
they are hacking

1296
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,920
clearly in this era we need far far more

1297
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,880
regional cooperation between like-minded

1298
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,640
anti-authoritarian rule-based societies

1299
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,119
my question is

1300
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,839
uh well how much of that is there there

1301
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,920
isn't very much i mean even between the

1302
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,960
united states and europe now that the uk

1303
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,640
has departed

1304
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,680
uh

1305
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,920
from the from the european union

1306
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,800
uh i mean five eyes europe is out of it

1307
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,839
and then there is then there are the

1308
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,680
democracies uh on the other side of the

1309
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,040
pacific

1310
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
they too high

1311
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,760
rule-based democratic societies

1312
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,319
um highly technologically advanced yet

1313
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,280
we see

1314
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,680
uh we don't see any kind of defensive or

1315
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,200
security based uh

1316
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,200
activity with question i mean

1317
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,280
cooperation

1318
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,920
alliances my question is what are the

1319
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,960
prospects what needs to be overcome why

1320
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,040
can't we do this

1321
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,280
i am so happy that i am a moderator

1322
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,680
right now

1323
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,359
the national defense strategy emphasizes

1324
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,720
the importance of partnerships and

1325
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
alliances as general nakasone says the

1326
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400
united states has friends other

1327
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
countries have clients

1328
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,760
the united states

1329
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,040
yes we are

1330
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,319
very focused on the security

1331
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,079
relationship with the north atlantic but

1332
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,720
we also have treaty commitments

1333
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,119
and defense agreements mutual defense

1334
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,359
agreements with asia pacific allies

1335
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,760
which are very robust the united states

1336
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,559
has significant military presence

1337
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,079
in countries in asia we are a pacific

1338
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,319
nation which as someone who grew up on

1339
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,640
the pacific coast i'm very aware of and

1340
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,079
that's not even

1341
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,319
the end of where the united states is in

1342
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,079
the pacific

1343
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,319
i think that we have to be

1344
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,880
wary of a narrative that the chinese are

1345
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
trying to spread

1346
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,119
that

1347
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,160
asia should only be for asians

1348
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,760
and sitting here as a representative of

1349
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,359
the united states

1350
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,680
the united states is an asia-pacific

1351
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,079
nation

1352
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,319
and so as we build those relationships

1353
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,920
as we continue that i think the

1354
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,839
cooperation is quite strong our

1355
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,079
alliances are quite strong um we need to

1356
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,079
build on that we have partnerships

1357
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,880
around the world and it is a network of

1358
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,559
partnerships that we bring to bear and

1359
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,480
we work with people depending on their

1360
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,079
interest and depending on

1361
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,640
their maturity it does not require a

1362
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,240
monolithic

1363
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,920
bipolar network confrontation

1364
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,839
we will work with countries as they come

1365
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,480
i think we have uh alliances in the asia

1366
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,520
pacific region which are

1367
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,040
strong

1368
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,920
which

1369
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,640
work on a daily basis to deter

1370
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,960
malicious activities or activities that

1371
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,559
will challenge the existing

1372
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,480
international order

1373
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,880
and ultimately conflict

1374
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,079
the

1375
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,680
the united states

1376
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,839
has the seventh fleet four deployed in

1377
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,520
japan uh

1378
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,960
japan okinawa and okinawa hosts the

1379
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,880
one of the three marine expeditionary

1380
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,920
forces of the united states marine corps

1381
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,800
the naval academy cadets are nodding

1382
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,359
yeah

1383
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,319
we have 55 000 uh us

1384
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,760
troops stationed in japan um

1385
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
there's also a strong alliance with

1386
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,359
japan with the us and korea as well in

1387
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,960
australia as well

1388
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,280
and on top of that

1389
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,079
i'm not foreseeing a new uh military

1390
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,040
alliance uh to be to be forged but we

1391
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,480
have various layers of uh international

1392
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,680
uh

1393
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,000
fora that we cooperate with that we

1394
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,920
cooperate with asean there's also the

1395
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,240
east asian summit which includes asean

1396
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,520
post us and also australia new zealand

1397
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,720
india

1398
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,800
we also have that the quad is something

1399
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,040
that we had created this was something

1400
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,119
that we had advocated for

1401
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
uh and

1402
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,839
now

1403
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,480
because of well not just because of

1404
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,280
ukraine but we are forging closer ties

1405
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,119
with nato um

1406
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,359
our foreign minister attended nato's

1407
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,880
foreign minister's meeting for the first

1408
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,200
time in april

1409
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,000
we have close ties in cyber we have we

1410
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,960
have the cyber staff talks with nato

1411
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,119
we attend as an observer the formal

1412
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,359
exercise we also attend the locked

1413
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,280
shields here at the center we have an

1414
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,760
official from the ministry of defense uh

1415
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,240
in the center uh this past concert

1416
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,079
continuously

1417
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,079
and i think

1418
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,000
what i'd like to say is

1419
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,440
amongst all the military alliances the

1420
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,319
united states is at the center uh with

1421
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,920
with the strongest military in the world

1422
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
i mean there is no question about that

1423
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,960
uh and

1424
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,680
they with the alliance that we force

1425
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,200
in this part of the world it's nato in

1426
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,520
our part of the world it's bilateral uh

1427
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,559
treaties

1428
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,680
but the this is extremely strong and

1429
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,359
sound and i think

1430
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,559
up until now have deterred

1431
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,280
a really serious uh malicious or

1432
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,480
military activity to take place okay let

1433
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,880
me just clarify my question

1434
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,720
if you discover a new apt

1435
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
how do we know about it

1436
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
how is it that all of i mean because the

1437
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,880
apt

1438
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,640
or advanced persistent threat that you

1439
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,640
discover brand new

1440
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,720
it can attack

1441
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
us just as much as you but you have

1442
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,800
discovered it how do we find out about

1443
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,720
what are the structures

1444
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,440
the that currently exists by which we

1445
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,119
automatically you know with the

1446
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,520
milliseconds that it takes to get from

1447
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,319
tokyo to thailand find out that oh we

1448
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,319
discovered this new bad guy

1449
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,400
that's all i mean this is what exactly

1450
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,599
we don't have the institutional

1451
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,760
arrangements for that right now

1452
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,440
i think that as we look at

1453
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,280
public-private partnerships

1454
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,760
the persistence requirements for an apt

1455
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,599
means that they would be very clearly

1456
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,720
visible

1457
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,280
not only to our governments but to

1458
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,000
private sector actors the question then

1459
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,760
becomes the attribution and the intent

1460
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,800
behind the apt that an apt is out there

1461
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,520
and that it is uh establishing presence

1462
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,440
on a network is a different question on

1463
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,520
whether than whether they are disrupting

1464
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
the network and the disruptions rising

1465
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,040
to a particular level announced

1466
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,480
themselves

1467
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,079
i don't think that we have a challenge

1468
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,640
in terms of the arrival of a new apt and

1469
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,400
our inability to talk about that law

1470
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,640
enforcement cooperation

1471
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,000
national security and intelligence

1472
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,400
cooperation private sector cooperation

1473
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,520
um apts are known by many names by many

1474
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,680
different actors and we see them

1475
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,440
on the networks all the time so i think

1476
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,319
that there's not necessarily a need for

1477
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,559
an institutional environment you know we

1478
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,880
don't need sort of an icann for apts to

1479
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,960
name them and like assign them names so

1480
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,240
that everybody calls them the same thing

1481
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,720
i think we are doing okay

1482
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,720
we are doing okay i think in terms of

1483
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,119
swiftly exchanging information uh on

1484
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,599
those uh threats that we we catch we

1485
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,359
capture we don't we don't hog the

1486
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,280
information we we spread it around to

1487
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,800
make sure that everyone is aware as you

1488
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,760
had

1489
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,160
mentioned uh it's instant so it needs to

1490
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,079
be shared instantly in the same way we

1491
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,599
do for cyber vulnerabilities right i

1492
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,839
mean we declare them um internationally

1493
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,200
we've got the cyber threat alliance

1494
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,040
multinational organizations in the

1495
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,400
private domain it would be harder to

1496
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,640
keep it quiet than it would be to share

1497
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,000
so again i don't think it's a matter of

1498
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,839
setting up special alliances to do that

1499
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,839
i think we're happy to share that

1500
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,839
the fact of and and and some of the

1501
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,680
behaviors and i would just like to say

1502
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,599
this multi-stakeholder structure stands

1503
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,760
in stark contrast to the structure that

1504
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,280
china is trying to establish what

1505
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,599
requires uh disclosure of these

1506
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,400
vulnerabilities to the government first

1507
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,240
for their determination on how that

1508
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,319
would go i don't think that that is the

1509
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,720
kind of thing that we want in us in a

1510
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,359
multi-stakeholder free and open society

1511
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,160
we do not require that the governments

1512
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,040
are the first to know and then decide

1513
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,640
whether or not the public and the

1514
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,520
industry should know it is something we

1515
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,520
all know and share at the same time

1516
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,720
absolutely and of course that was

1517
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,240
exactly the case of the look for jay

1518
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,880
right there was an alibaba employee who

1519
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,280
who um announced it and talked to apache

1520
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,799
about it and i thought it was okay and

1521
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,520
then i hope so too right but you know

1522
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,280
china um

1523
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,799
i think ended up sanctioning alibaba

1524
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,400
cloud and cancelled their

1525
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,319
um contract with them for six months and

1526
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,960
then said that i will reassess later

1527
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,119
when you've addressed this so you know

1528
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,319
we're not interested in applying that

1529
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,079
kind of pressure we know that they're

1530
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,040
going to be hiding the kinds of

1531
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
vulnerabilities that they find

1532
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,599
but you know that's a stark contrast to

1533
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,960
how the rest of the world intends to

1534
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,559
continue operating

1535
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,040
this this information sharing reminded

1536
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,480
me of one one

1537
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,319
talk of a colleague a couple of years

1538
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,200
ago

1539
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,119
and there was an european colleague who

1540
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,440
was saying that uh it was it's really

1541
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
useful to have some contacts with

1542
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,720
with their asian countries i mean first

1543
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,040
with australia with japan with singapore

1544
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,040
because they wake up earlier

1545
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
they know about different attacks

1546
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,079
earlier but we have a time for a last

1547
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,079
quick question and and we have their

1548
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,760
hand happens

1549
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,720
please

1550
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,760
hi

1551
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,640
oh sorry

1552
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,359
hi wish all do my highly respect i am

1553
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,880
from taiwan

1554
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,880
um maybe the

1555
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,799
one of the representatives from

1556
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,920
indo-pacific area

1557
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,359
and let me quickly answer the questions

1558
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,200
in uh for the

1559
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,640
previous one

1560
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,920
we look at the apts not only for layer

1561
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,160
ttps but also for layer malware patterns

1562
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,720
there are always the signature was some

1563
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,920
signal that he then he knows malware and

1564
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,200
also like which has uh

1565
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,640
um the hacking group from mainland china

1566
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,200
we can understand that most of they use

1567
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,760
a social engineer as a first as a

1568
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,559
stepping point and they also let zero

1569
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,040
day to do the attack in the following

1570
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,760
but we can discuss that later my

1571
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,280
questions for

1572
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,559
um

1573
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,839
those

1574
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,040
panels on the stage is as a conference

1575
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,000
discussed lots of about the relationship

1576
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,240
between the russia and the

1577
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,359
ukraine this is the probably the very

1578
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,640
first session bring up the implication

1579
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,040
interaction in lake asia and in the

1580
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,280
pacific area

1581
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,520
i don't really mean timeline the china i

1582
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,680
just say it's a

1583
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,799
broadly speaking the indo-pacific area

1584
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,640
what do you think the front-line

1585
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,599
countries no matter in the geographic

1586
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,280
term or the cyber term to do to work on

1587
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,839
and to keep moving to shape the

1588
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,960
environment and to be more sustainable

1589
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,000
for the threat in the future and how can

1590
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,359
those countries do align with the europe

1591
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,400
where nato interests

1592
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,200
strategically were taken not technically

1593
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,079
um well what can we help what can

1594
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,799
taiwan do taiwan help

1595
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,240
thanks

1596
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,440
i really appreciate the question i think

1597
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,599
taiwan like ukraine

1598
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,000
is at the front line of

1599
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,119
cyber

1600
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,440
malicious cyber activity and so they are

1601
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
very much a frontline state and so

1602
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,440
taiwan like ukraine has

1603
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,319
very uh has a lot of experience with how

1604
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,960
that malicious actor is trying to access

1605
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,040
and potentially disrupt their networks

1606
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,480
and so there's much that we can all

1607
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,799
learn from their experience

1608
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,720
in this regard

1609
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,960
lessons for frontline countries from

1610
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,680
ukraine i think include understanding

1611
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,240
how ukraine was able to maintain its

1612
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,359
resilience its ability to communicate

1613
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,599
with the outside world and its ability

1614
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,359
to continue to command and control its

1615
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,880
forces while under the most rigorous

1616
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,319
strain that we have ever seen in the

1617
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,359
cyber domain from outside forces

1618
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,160
lessons learned from ukraine in terms of

1619
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,200
how they reacted to the disruption of

1620
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,280
their satellite communications

1621
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,599
how they are able to become resilient

1622
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,040
and have

1623
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,599
multiple ways of you know falling back

1624
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,680
and degrading as things are

1625
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,160
disrupted the number of the cooperation

1626
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,880
between the isps in ukraine is an

1627
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,799
example of how they can

1628
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,720
move to migrate quickly when disruption

1629
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,599
occurs their migration to the cloud

1630
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,520
during the conflict is another example

1631
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,280
of things that peop frontline nations

1632
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,240
can think about how do you develop

1633
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,359
resilient architecture

1634
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,240
that will help you withstand

1635
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,960
disruption in the cyber domain and i

1636
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,400
think that there are many

1637
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,720
countries that could learn a lot about

1638
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,960
having resilient architecture from what

1639
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,240
has happened

1640
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,400
in ukraine and we look forward to

1641
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,160
being able to continue to engage with

1642
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,000
them on their lessons learned perhaps

1643
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,480
when they have a little more time

1644
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,559
i think this uh this is a good good

1645
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,880
moment uh and good thoughts actually to

1646
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,079
uh just to end this conversation

1647
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,640
um and i'm really sorry for those who

1648
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,559
still had questions but that did not

1649
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,880
have the time um

1650
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,079
i thought it was a fascinating and

1651
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,640
and thank you so much for being here and

1652
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
and

1653
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,799
let's thank the panel please

1654
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,580
[Applause]
