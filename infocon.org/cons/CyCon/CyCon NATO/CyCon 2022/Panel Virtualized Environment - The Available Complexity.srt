1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,320
good morning everyone

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,040
i hope you enjoyed the hospitality of

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,440
the cyclone yesterday night and you were

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
not crazy enough to drive to riga for an

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
iron maiden concert and get back so with

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
this those who were actually at the at

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
the cyclone dinner you already

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,640
experienced part of the session that

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,080
we're going to tackle so this is

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,480
bringing a historical events into the

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
virtual reality or addressing the

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
digital twin technology in the current

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
era so with this we keep moving and this

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
session is virtualized environment and

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
the available complexity with me i have

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
the panelists joe sid and ibars who will

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
going to

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
introduce their topics and explain their

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
field of research

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
before we start there are few house

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,399
rules

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,600
each

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,480
presenter has 20 minutes and after which

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
we're going to have 10 minutes of q a

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
within the q a everyone here present is

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,160
encouraged to ask questions as so as

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
well the other panelists are encouraged

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,479
to engage in the discussion with the

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,760
rest

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
without a further due

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
let's

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,080
keep moving

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,880
joe

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
is going to be the first one and he is a

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
phd student at the university of

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,759
plymouth and his work is focused on

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,520
exploring the digital twin technology

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
towards increasing dockyard's efficiency

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,240
thank you very much the crowd is yours

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
so to begin with i'm going to look at

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,360
the background of the site that i'm

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
working on which is hmnb devonport

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
that's her majesty's naval base

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
devonport which is in plymouth which is

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
in the south west of england

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
it's the largest naval base in western

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
europe

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
it has over 650 acres of land and four

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
miles of waterfront and employs over two

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
and a half thousand service personnel

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
and civilians

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
it's the largest energy consumer in the

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
area and possibly the entirety of the

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
city and it's one of three raw navy

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
dockyards in the uk

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
one of the main challenges for

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
digitization for this site is that it

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,719
was built in the 17th century which

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
means much of the infrastructure

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
has not been designed for digitization

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
it is home to the royal navy's

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
amphibious ships survey ships and half

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
of her frigates it has 15 dry docks

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
25 turtle basins and five basins for for

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
maintenance of those vessels

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
and also it has training facilities for

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
flag office sea training and also

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
submarine training

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
barracks that includes medical dental

70
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
facilities for those living on site and

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
also recreational facilities and

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
accommodation

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,440
so it's quite a large complex site to to

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
try and to optimize

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
so digital twin this is what i'm i'm

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
researching at the moment

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
and my understanding of digital twin is

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
that it's a virtual representation of a

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
physical entity now if you ask lots of

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,239
people what a digital twin is you'll

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
probably get lots of different answers

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
so let's name a few ibm say that it

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
accurately reflects a physical object

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
nvidia says it has to be a true to

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
reality simulation of physics and

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
materials

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
which has to be continuously updated

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
and then forbes has a similar

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
description to what i have given but

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
they all have the underlying

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
definition of that it is a virtual

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
representation of a physical entity

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
now what are we going to be doing we're

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
going to be

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
modeling the entirety of the dockyard

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
as a digital twin and that is going to

97
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
be for it for a number of purposes to be

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
able to understand what the current

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
limitations of the dockyard is and how

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
they can be improved

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,519
why are we doing it well that's twofold

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
first of all

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
the royal navy wants to know what they

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
can do better so we've got a an old

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
dockyard that can be improved we know it

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
can be improved by building a digital

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
twin we'll be able to find out specific

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
ways in which that can happen

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
and secondly due to the scale of the

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
site and complexity of the site

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
academically it's an interesting topic

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
because we're looking at a digital twin

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
of a large

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
large area with a completely different

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,599
goal to other twins because as the the

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,439
royal navy dot card is military as

117
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
opposed to commercial the goals of the

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
site are also completely different we're

119
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,840
not looking at trying to make as much

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
money as possible

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,238
we're trying to make sure that our

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
military assets are available as often

123
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
as we can

124
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
so what do we hope to achieve by the end

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,240
of this project we hope to have a

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
proof of concept

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,880
for how digital twins can benefit a

128
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
royal navy dockyard

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
which should then provide results as to

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,000
how

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
much

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,840
the the output the results of the

133
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
optimization of that twin

134
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
if implemented can actually save the doc

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
guard either money reduce carbon

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
emissions or improve develop

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
availability of vessels

138
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
so the digital twin specifically has

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
three key domains

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
first of all is the infrastructure which

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
looks at the buildings roads and

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
pathways and critical port

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,919
infrastructure on the site all of that

144
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
needs to be modeled

145
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,440
then we have utilities domain which

146
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
looks at communications

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
energy and water

148
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
and then the operational domain which is

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
asset tracking people and teams and

150
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
workload so each of those domains

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
contain a number of layers as i've just

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
just uh talked through and those layers

153
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,680
will all be individual models however

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
what makes this a digital twin is that

155
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
all of those separate models will be

156
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
based upon data from other

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
layers so we'll all be interconnected so

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
make a change in one layer that change

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
the effects of that change will be

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
visible in other layers

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
so all of that will be modeled together

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
to then give accurate results

163
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
so here's an example of how this could

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
be used if we simulate a power cut

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
that will be on the power layer of the

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
utilities domain

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
that will then be visible on the

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
infrastructure domain in the buildings

169
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
layer so one building may lose power now

170
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
one building that could have a few teams

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
working within that that would then

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
identify within the twin which teams

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
have lost their ability to to do what

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
they need to do on site

175
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,199
that will show the impact of that power

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,240
cut

177
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
additionally the people within that

178
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
building may be able to work elsewhere

179
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,520
however there may be critical network

180
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,759
infrastructure for example a an active

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
network switch in that building if that

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
goes offline then the communications

183
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
layer will show you where

184
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
people on site may lose connectivity and

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
then again other people may not be able

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
to do their day job so you'll be able to

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,199
simulate

188
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,479
outages

189
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,160
around the site from from maybe one

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
small outage

191
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
so the stages of development start from

192
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
modeling that's making sure that all of

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
the models we create are accurate to the

194
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
site

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
with the right level of abstraction of

196
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
data

197
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
then we need to analyze the site in its

198
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
current state looking at what the

199
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
potential limitations are

200
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
and also looking at um

201
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
where we can improve

202
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,599
and then finally we have optimization

203
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
which is finding solutions to those

204
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
problems and also problems that maybe

205
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
individual people on the site have

206
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,639
themselves they'll be able to input

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,560
those problems to find a solution

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
through optimization

209
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
so modeling what are the challenges of

210
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
modeling well first we have the data

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,199
collection being a 17th century site

212
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
some of the data

213
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
may be difficult to find or difficult to

214
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
gather so that is a really key problem

215
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,039
that needs to be overcome early on uh to

216
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,720
make sure we have data so i've started

217
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
with the communications layer because

218
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,120
that is a layer that has as much data as

219
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
i need at the moment but as i go forward

220
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
i'll need to find ways to collect data

221
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
that may not be as easy to gather

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
then we need to make sure that the

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,880
the data is accurate and relevant but

224
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
also that the model that's created is

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
accurate and relevant to the site there

226
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,919
is

227
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,440
a really key point with digital twins

228
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
that if the model isn't accurate the

229
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
results you get out will also

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
effectively be invalid because it's not

231
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
going to show you what the true state of

232
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
things are

233
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
so from this stage on its own it will be

234
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
beneficial to users on the naval base

235
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
because they will have access to

236
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
visualization of the current state of

237
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
all of those layers so if you're working

238
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,759
in in one key area you'll be able to use

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,160
the digital twin to find a visualized

240
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
way of representing that data so they

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,759
can complete their day-to-day job

242
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
slightly easier than current

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
next is analysis

244
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
so analysis is looking at identifying

245
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,240
vulnerabilities

246
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,520
specifically through single points of

247
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
failure that's the first area that i'm

248
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
looking at for identifying

249
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
vulnerabilities so that is looking at a

250
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,320
single point on the site that if that

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
point was removed has the greatest

252
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,320
impact over the sites there'll be

253
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
so many uh points within the site that

254
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
if you remove will have an effect almost

255
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
all of them but which one has the

256
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
greatest effect will be found out

257
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
through analysis and that'll look at

258
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,040
each layer and also look at the impact

259
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
across other layers

260
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,440
so across the priorities of the naval

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,959
base which are

262
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,120
primarily to improve availability of

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
vessels but then also we do want to

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,399
reduce

265
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
our expenditure and reduce our carbon

266
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
emissions

267
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
we will have a fitness score through the

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
analysis for each of those topics

269
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
initially that will just be an arbitrary

270
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
number but every change that is made

271
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
either through optimization or through a

272
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
manual change

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,880
those three

274
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
fitness areas will be scored so then we

275
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
can assess as to whether the solution is

276
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
better or worse for those we only want

277
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
to pursue solutions which have an

278
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
improvement on the priority for that

279
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
work

280
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
so the user with this stage will be able

281
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
to make minor changes to the data

282
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
monitor the impact on the fitness scores

283
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
and the purpose of that would be to aid

284
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
decision making if it's better then they

285
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
can go with that

286
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
but then finally we have optimization

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,920
which uses genetic programming

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,040
so using single objective optimization

289
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
just to solve the problem you've got a

290
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,399
key problem that needs to be solved

291
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
regardless of anything else

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
we can run an optimization algorithm to

293
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
find the best solution for that problem

294
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
which is

295
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
really good however that may have very

296
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
expensive costs for

297
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
other priorities of the naval base

298
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
so that is why the digital twin will

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
also look into multi-objective

300
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
optimization to then look at all of

301
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
those priorities together

302
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
where the main one is to solve the

303
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
problem we're trying to solve but also

304
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,279
if we can do that in a way that reduces

305
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
environmental impact and reduces the

306
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,120
total expenditure of the site then that

307
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,079
is a

308
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
bonus as well and that will produce a

309
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
selection of possible solutions

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
so the decision makers can consider

311
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,079
everything because sometimes it is

312
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,839
worthwhile to spend a bit more or have a

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
bit more carbon emissions if the end

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
result is going to be better but this

315
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
should give them all of the data they

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
should need to be able to make those

317
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
decisions

318
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
best for the for the decision that he's

319
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
making

320
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
so where am i now within the development

321
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,240
i'm right at the beginning

322
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
so i've modeled the communications layer

323
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
of the site

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,880
and

325
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
that is that is where i'm at at the

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
moment starting the analysis stage next

327
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
i have lots more data to collect uh to

328
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,200
be able to model the remainder of the

329
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
site to make it a digital twin at its

330
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,959
current state is just a it's just a

331
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
computer model it's not a digital twin

332
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
yet but that is where i'm going

333
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
to be able to run optimization

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
algorithms on on the site

335
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
other challenges i have being a military

336
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
site

337
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
is that uh all of the data that i'm

338
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,760
collecting for for the site is

339
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
confidential and can't be published

340
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
so that is a big

341
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,800
drawback from my phd research is that i

342
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
can't publish what i'm doing

343
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,839
so to go around that i've tried to

344
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,399
create artificial data that represents

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
something similar to to the site however

346
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
that has proved doing that uh

347
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,399
autonomously has proved quite difficult

348
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,519
because

349
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
automated data to design a network looks

350
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
nothing like a network

351
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,519
so what i've done

352
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,240
is i've created a set of data

353
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
which is much smaller than the dockyard

354
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
which allows it to look almost like a

355
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,720
network which has worked i do have that

356
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
data and i can publish that data however

357
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
it doesn't accurately reflect a real

358
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
life scenario so that is

359
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
not not ideal for this type of research

360
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
so i've been speaking around with other

361
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,399
ports

362
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,839
and i've found a third party that is

363
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,800
happy

364
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,600
to

365
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
to provide me all of the data that they

366
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
have and allow me to publish all the

367
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
data on their airport that is a

368
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
commercial port in the uk

369
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
they've asked to remain anonymous at

370
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,279
this point

371
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
but that will allow me to go forward

372
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,959
publishing all of the data from that

373
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,959
board while by while designing the same

374
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
digital twin for the raw navy which

375
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
remains confidential

376
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
so looking at what i've done so far

377
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,000
the image on the screen shows you a

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,079
a diagram of that network this is

379
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
artificial data it does not reflect a

380
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
real site

381
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
each of the the points is a node that

382
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
would be a building because at the

383
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
moment the communications layer is

384
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
building specific

385
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
and each point the size of the point is

386
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,760
how many neighbors come off that how

387
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
many

388
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880
buildings that is connected to uh it's

389
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
not geographic so there's no no

390
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
coordinates there it's just based on

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
trying to make the image with as few

392
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
cross lines as possible

393
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
interacting with that you if you go to

394
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
one of the nodes you can see all of the

395
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
neighbors that are connected so for a

396
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
for the view of an individual user

397
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
trying to interact with their day-to-day

398
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,920
job

399
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
rather than trawling through a long

400
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
excel spreadsheet to try and find which

401
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,279
nodes are connected to to which

402
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
buildings

403
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
this would make it a lot more graphic

404
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
and being able to overlay this with a

405
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
physical satellite representation of the

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
site which would then

407
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,639
move the diagram to the correct

408
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
coordinates would then allow much easier

409
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,920
interaction from those end users

410
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
being able to see the neighbors uh

411
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,959
that's not all we need because often

412
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,560
there are many connections going between

413
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,120
the same two buildings if you look at

414
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
the edge you can see the actual id which

415
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,959
is affiliated to that final

416
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,760
uh that connection which will massively

417
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
help the end users using that

418
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
so that's very similar with

419
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,839
the other

420
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,920
utilities layers

421
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
so with power and water

422
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
they will be designed in a very similar

423
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,880
way

424
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,839
however looking back to the uh the

425
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,839
different layers that we'll be modeling

426
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,279
there'll be certain things that won't be

427
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
able to be modeled in this way so

428
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
buildings will be derived from the the

429
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,639
satellite imagery all the utilities will

430
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
be derived in this way but then looking

431
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
at the right hand side which was

432
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
operational

433
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
that is something that's going to be

434
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
very unique for each layer so first of

435
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
all we have asset tracking which is

436
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
arguably one of the easiest ways or best

437
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
ways that we can

438
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
actually derive results from this

439
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,639
digital twin because that will track all

440
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
of our infrastructure

441
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,920
and at

442
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,079
the end level it would be everything

443
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
from small items of

444
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
use all the way up to all the cranes and

445
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
port infrastructure

446
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,839
asset tracking will monitor everything

447
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
that that item is doing it will look at

448
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,519
when the engine's running when it's

449
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,959
actually in operation

450
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
the statistical analysis all of that of

451
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,920
all of that data should identify where

452
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
where where we're going wrong so if an

453
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
item is hired for two weeks but it's

454
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
only used for three of those days so

455
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
therefore an external item has to be

456
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
hired in and that is only going to be

457
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
that's also hide in for two weeks but

458
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
it's only used for a different set of

459
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,320
days

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
that is that is a waste of time

461
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,199
we could just use that same crane or it

462
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
could potentially be that another job

463
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
has to be put on hold because that item

464
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
is uh

465
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
is being used elsewhere it's hired but

466
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
it's not actually in use to be able to

467
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,279
look at that data will give us

468
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,079
information as to what is being used

469
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
and how we can improve prove things then

470
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
looking at people and teams that's going

471
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,320
to look specifically at where people

472
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
need to be working so some jobs

473
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
office-based jobs

474
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
can be done across the site or

475
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
potentially even remotely so they will

476
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
be they will be modelled but they will

477
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,519
have a clause that they can work

478
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
elsewhere so that is not a vital

479
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
failure if if that if they can't work in

480
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
their building

481
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,759
however other work has to be done in

482
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,959
that location

483
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,560
so if if one of those buildings go down

484
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
that will then identify that work cannot

485
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,240
be taken and it will not be going

486
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
forward

487
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,839
uh so i'm afraid i've finished a couple

488
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,959
of minutes early i hope that's not a

489
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,199
problem uh but i'd be happy to take any

490
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,800
questions if you have them

491
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
thank you take your seat and then we're

492
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
going to dive into the discussion

493
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,680
session

494
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
now when i read uh joe's paper initially

495
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,040
i felt he's trying to recreate a 90s

496
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
game transfer tycoon

497
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,759
we all loved playing back back then

498
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
however the level of complexity that

499
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
you're trying to bring in um

500
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
is fascinating currently at this stage

501
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,199
you're more playing with the digital

502
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,079
doppelganger versus digital twin uh and

503
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
you are trying to facilitate the

504
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,399
decision making process uh to make the

505
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,279
dockyard working more efficient now if

506
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
we look at the layers you're currently

507
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
working with the implementation of the

508
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,319
communication layer

509
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,359
uh a communication layer what components

510
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
have you already considered for

511
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
implementation and how how's it been

512
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,319
going with this one

513
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
so the communication there is looking

514
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,679
specifically at

515
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,119
where where the

516
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
buildings are in how they're

517
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
interconnected so it's looking at their

518
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,599
neighbors um to create that map

519
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
it does have other data included which

520
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
is uh sort of how many cables and

521
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
connections there are within each cable

522
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,919
and how many cables are going in the

523
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,679
same direction that's data that i can

524
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,160
use in the in the future but the the

525
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
implementation of that in the model is

526
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,360
uh is it's very much an analysis of

527
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
where how nodes are connected together

528
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
and it is a it's just a plain script

529
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
which i've written myself it's not

530
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,559
nothing uh

531
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,240
no no framework right when you're going

532
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,039
to

533
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,640
carry on with implementation further

534
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
implementation of the communication

535
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
layer and also other layers

536
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
how granular do you think you're going

537
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
if you're saying that you're going for

538
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
the buildings first the physical layer

539
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,160
buildings if you're going to target

540
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
physics rain everything that can

541
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
actually impact have a significant

542
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,440
impact on the dockyard functionality if

543
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
it's icy can the can the employees get

544
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,799
to the

545
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,679
to their work in the can the uh

546
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,600
cars drive within the

547
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
campus and if you're looking at the data

548
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
connectivity layer would you go and try

549
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
to emulate some network protocols that

550
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,039
are there as well or that is totally out

551
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,960
of the out of the decision-making

552
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
process uh it's definitely not out of

553
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,280
the decision-making process um

554
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
the idea of the digital twin that

555
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
finally if they implement this on the

556
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,000
site

557
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
as much as can be modelled with modeled

558
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
but within the scope of my project um

559
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,840
what i've done for the

560
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,960
for the communications layer at the

561
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
moment i'm going to leave that as it is

562
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,360
so that i can add much more

563
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
into the total digital twin which will

564
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
then allow me to to model everything as

565
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,240
a whole which will allow me to get the

566
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,559
results to monitor the impact before i

567
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,200
go back and add layers of abstraction

568
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
i understand i would like to take also

569
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
the questions from the uh from the

570
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
audience

571
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
i know it's early morning but uh

572
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,039
and the first bird is gabor

573
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
mike i got mike

574
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,000
so uh a question how do you plan the the

575
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
model quality assessment or the model

576
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
quality analysis if you are restricted

577
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
in the source data

578
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,840
so

579
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,760
i'm i'm within a team at the dockyard at

580
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
the moment uh the cis team

581
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,200
and

582
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,360
so all of the information and data i get

583
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,799
from the dockyard

584
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
i get through that team so i've got

585
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
those points of contact so any results i

586
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
derive initially i don't expect once i

587
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
first model something uh for it to be

588
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
fully accurate so that is going to be an

589
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
iterative approach with that team

590
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,520
to to work through the data that i get

591
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
to then to monitor the effectiveness and

592
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
then i can tweak the model until i get

593
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
something that they all think is is

594
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,559
relevant and then i'll see if there's

595
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,360
other

596
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,039
industry specialists on the site that i

597
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
can do final checks with oh excellent

598
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
thanks thank you

599
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
following the gabor's question so

600
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
are you going to collect also historic

601
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,080
data meaning that i mean you can't maybe

602
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,159
you can still collect these prehistoric

603
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,039
data

604
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,840
before starting before your uh research

605
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,640
or

606
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
you're going just to start at this point

607
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,720
collecting the data related to how the

608
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,080
dockyard operates what's the also the

609
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,960
the the traffic intensity how the

610
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
operations work there what's the network

611
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
load uh and so forth how are you going

612
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
to collect and what are the methods that

613
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
you're considering for the data

614
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,280
collection because you need to have a

615
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
decent model there yeah yeah absolutely

616
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
so

617
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
lots of the doc card as it currently

618
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
stands collects lots of data

619
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,559
as it is but it doesn't do much with

620
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
much with it at the moment they're all

621
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
all kept separate so i've got lots of

622
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
contacts that i'm looking to exploit to

623
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
collect that data and build into the

624
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,880
model

625
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,960
the future of the digital twin would be

626
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
to have that data collection automated

627
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
through iot sensors spread around the

628
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,600
site um because that's always going to

629
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
make it as accurate as it can be have it

630
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
having real-time data um but for the

631
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
initial model it will be based on static

632
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
data as it is now so

633
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
in my current stage any data i can get

634
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
my hands on will go into the model

635
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,919
where as and when i can get updated

636
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,200
versions then obviously i'll update but

637
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
at my initial stages of development i

638
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
just need to get as much data as i can

639
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,320
together

640
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,799
um any other panelists do you have a

641
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,960
question sid go ahead go ahead i have a

642
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
question um so with the recent

643
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,840
events which have happened in

644
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
like global shipyard industry and the

645
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
docking industry especially in the

646
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
united states and we have seen the

647
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,919
impact of what can happen when

648
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,240
when a critical infrastructure like that

649
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
gets choked so

650
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
how do you plan to extend this work or

651
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
make it transferable enough to be

652
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
applied to dockyards which do not

653
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
conform to the model that you are

654
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
focused on

655
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
how flexible will this trend be that's

656
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
that's a really good question so i think

657
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,760
because

658
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
i'm in the unique position now that i'm

659
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
developing the

660
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,039
the digital twin for the dockyard but

661
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,440
also for a commercial port

662
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,559
there is going to be inherent

663
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
flexibility within that because i want

664
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
one singular

665
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,919
model to be able to take in either data

666
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,919
data set so it's going to have

667
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,200
it's going to be built in with the

668
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
priorities for for certain things that

669
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,760
will relate to commercial and also

670
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
military

671
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,559
within the same model because i don't

672
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
want to develop two completely separate

673
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
digital twins for the same project

674
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
so that flexibility that will be built

675
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,520
in there will allow it to be

676
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,600
transferable between

677
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
certain things

678
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,120
however that is is all going to be

679
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
specific to the maritime environment in

680
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
this state

681
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,520
so it's going to be ports or

682
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,360
or dockyard right thanks right

683
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
one of the questions that we have is

684
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
also would this model be applicable so

685
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
something beyond just the dockyards can

686
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
you apply it to anything else and with

687
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
yes that what would be

688
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,919
yeah absolutely so the digital twin

689
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,080
technology is absolutely applicable to

690
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,039
to almost anything um the model that i'm

691
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,640
creating the digital twin i'm creating

692
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
is specifically for

693
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,440
uh

694
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
the naval base down at devonport

695
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,679
but also my third party port so it's

696
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
going to have a bit of flexibility built

697
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
in there

698
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
but additionally the technology that

699
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,679
that that is based upon um would would

700
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,799
absolutely be able to use for other

701
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
other sort of uh

702
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
places of a similar scale so an airport

703
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,240
for example either military or or

704
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,080
commercial uh would be another

705
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,919
application for this technology are you

706
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,919
going for a very complex

707
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,919
complex issues here

708
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,919
we have we have a question look

709
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,919
actually i had several questions but you

710
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,279
asked many of them

711
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,679
so i'm left with only two and um the

712
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
first one then is for you bb did you

713
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
really drive to riga last night for a

714
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
rock concert

715
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
i did yes there's a couple of people in

716
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,600
this conference that are i imagine them

717
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,679
like terminators like machine that just

718
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
keep going non-stop and people is one of

719
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,919
them okay so the question is for you

720
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
joseph congratulations great research

721
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
are you going to publish this model

722
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
are you going to make it available

723
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,799
do you believe that other people can

724
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,960
contribute to it to enrich the semantics

725
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,320
of it yeah absolutely um so

726
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
due to the model being um

727
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,400
the model specifically for the port

728
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
the third party port all of that

729
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
including the data i plan to publish

730
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
obviously with their permission from the

731
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
data from results side

732
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,039
i plan to publish everything and make

733
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,880
make the actual model the code for the

734
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
model open source i was speaking to

735
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
someone at one of the events earlier

736
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,240
this week and they've offered me some

737
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
access to one of their github their

738
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,480
company's github repositories for some

739
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
some modeling system uh so i absolutely

740
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,840
want to

741
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
sort of return that back to the open

742
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
source world

743
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
and i promised to the the panel that

744
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,520
you're not going to be the only one in

745
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
the hot seat here uh dodging all the

746
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
questions so um i have a question to the

747
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,679
rest of the panelists as well well i'll

748
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,440
start with the eye bars and the uh the

749
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,919
same question will go to the sid uh and

750
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
this is purely theoretical you don't

751
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
have to provide me already the working

752
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
details how would you tackle

753
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,640
this issue if you would come up with an

754
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
idea of

755
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,559
virtualizing or recreating a digital

756
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
twin for a naval dockyard or an airport

757
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,780
how would you approach this

758
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,120
[Applause]

759
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,760
actually this is a difficult question

760
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
for me why because i am not interested

761
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
in the shipyard however i

762
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
many of times i

763
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
entered to shipyard because i was a

764
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,640
safer and during this period i saw that

765
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
the one of the most important

766
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
issue is the human factor

767
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,880
and

768
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,440
you need to simulate also a human factor

769
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
in the shipyard as well and you can see

770
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
that

771
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,600
many incidents

772
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,000
is caused by the human factor and in the

773
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,919
digital timing maybe you can also

774
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,240
mention about the human factor right

775
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
thank you so do you have any take on

776
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,400
this yeah i'll pick off from where i was

777
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
left so the human factor is one of the

778
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,200
most interconnected and interdependent

779
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
pieces of any complex system like a

780
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,799
shipyard so modeling that modeling how

781
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,559
trade unions work modeling how the

782
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,679
shipyard

783
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,720
labor unions work that has a huge impact

784
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
on how the trans how the load gets

785
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
transferred through the ship through the

786
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
docks so that would be definitely one

787
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
thing which needs to be modeled and the

788
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,919
second thing is i would look at how much

789
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,159
fidelity do i want to go into the twin

790
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
with so

791
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
it so digital twin when people say it's

792
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,159
a digital twin it's either referring to

793
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,679
a digital model

794
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,840
which means it's approximating some part

795
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,159
of that physical process or it's a

796
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,799
digital shadow which means it's getting

797
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
inputs from a physical actual

798
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
operational system and then trying to

799
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
model the future states or it's a

800
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
completely bi-directional digital twin

801
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
which talks uh to and from this physical

802
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,919
process so

803
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,480
so that's so these are the three popular

804
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,919
like ways of differentiating between how

805
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,760
how accurate do people want to get with

806
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,240
these technologies so maybe we can start

807
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,559
with a very simple approximation like

808
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,279
game simulators or shipyard tycoon or

809
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
something like that that can be the

810
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,679
first step but as we move to like much

811
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,399
more real-world use cases you will need

812
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
to have this to and fro communication

813
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,039
between the twin and the physical

814
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,120
ships right thank you and i think joe

815
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,399
already mentioned that he would like to

816
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,159
extend this with the with the sensor

817
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,720
technology we have a question here from

818
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,840
the audience please yes hi uh verenika i

819
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
will not stand up yesterday night was a

820
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
bit uh much

821
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
um

822
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
so question to the three of you

823
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,960
potentially rather to the two of you is

824
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,559
how would that look like if you would

825
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,279
apply it to a mobile

826
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,360
uh station let's say so speaking about

827
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,120
satellites um how would you

828
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
what would be your way let's say to what

829
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
would be the best approach is to model

830
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,080
um the links with the satellite let's

831
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,799
say

832
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,120
and then speaking about security

833
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,279
concerns obviously you can

834
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,600
use the digital twin probably quite well

835
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,559
to do some pen testing to do you know uh

836
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
to find out where security gaps would

837
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:19,919
lie

838
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,960
um

839
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
so yeah write a general question what is

840
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
your take on that how could you best

841
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,240
implement uh digital twin on a satellite

842
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,919
we'll start with eye bars please if you

843
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,240
haven't if you have any take on this of

844
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,559
course uh yes this is

845
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,600
for

846
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
for example autonomous ship for the

847
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
autonomous ship the the security cyber

848
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,039
security is one of the most important

849
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,279
concerns and for the digital tv this is

850
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,159
like a digital twin uh and nowadays

851
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
there are some technology

852
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
systems are developing for example with

853
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
us technology and so through the with us

854
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,679
technology there are some encryptions

855
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,480
will be possible most probably

856
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,799
and

857
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
of course

858
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,799
not only during the attack after the

859
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,880
attack we should be carried by the uh

860
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,640
researchers this is another story

861
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,840
actually i mean uh cyber incident

862
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,880
handling

863
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,559
and

864
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,880
still ongoing process actually now as i

865
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
remember the third version of the gps

866
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,760
for example was started to be

867
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
tested and

868
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
against some

869
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
cyber attacks like jamming or spfing's

870
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,520
will be more resilience

871
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
but probably for the digital times it

872
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,640
will be also useful

873
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,600
right

874
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,679
sid i will save you because you will be

875
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,600
our next speaker but

876
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
before you are in the hot seat i wanted

877
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
to ask a

878
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
transition question to you joe

879
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,440
we're going to talk about the exercises

880
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,840
cyber exercises would you say

881
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
and briefly would you say that your

882
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
model could be integrated in one way or

883
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
another into these cyber exercises

884
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,640
well i'm by by no means an expert in in

885
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,279
cyber exercises but i i can see

886
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,279
the use case for for digital twin

887
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,480
technology with

888
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
those you those uh exercises having a

889
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,960
real life asset uh or environment being

890
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,039
modeled and then having that model

891
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,200
visualized for for the white hat for the

892
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
white team um i i can see the benefit

893
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
then i definitely think with with some

894
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,120
yes editing it would be right be useful

895
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
right thank you with this

896
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
you can start relaxing now and start

897
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,200
preparing for the questions to the rest

898
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,760
of the of the panelists with this i

899
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,559
would like to welcome on the stage sid

900
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
he's a researcher at the itra center for

901
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
research in cyber security at the

902
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,960
singapore university of technology and

903
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,840
design his work is focusing on cyber

904
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,880
physical systems and exercises related

905
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,919
to those

906
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,240
the crowd is yours sure and i will

907
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
answer that question about satellites in

908
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
my talk because it's extremely related

909
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,320
to everything that we go uh we go into

910
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
with cyber physical systems so as you

911
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,120
can see on the slide the theme of this

912
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
conference and the theme of like living

913
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,360
a long healthy life is to keep moving

914
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,919
and the way people have represented that

915
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,440
in the digital sphere is this um

916
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,399
cellular automat automaton which is

917
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
called the conveys game of life so it

918
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
follows very simple rules

919
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,360
and that those simple rules let it just

920
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
glide through the cyberspace and this

921
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,640
the reason i bring that up is because

922
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
this became the hacker emblem for

923
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,120
cypherpunks in the early 90s which is

924
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
where the whole field of cyber security

925
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,519
began and now we are at a state where

926
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,640
hackers

927
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,799
or problem solvers in general are not

928
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,320
just people who are underground but

929
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,039
people like you and me who work with the

930
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,880
governments every day and try to protect

931
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,440
our countries so with the spirit of

932
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,919
hacking and problem solving we'll start

933
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,080
the talk which is about the design of

934
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,039
cyber physical exercises and

935
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,760
i am a researcher at itrest as bb just

936
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
described

937
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,559
and

938
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,640
for more context i've been advised by

939
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
professor aditya mathur since 2016 so

940
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
that's the last six years of my life

941
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
and i've gotten the freedom to explore

942
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,760
like the whole broad range of emerging

943
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,320
technologies and that's what we will get

944
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,720
into in this particular talk

945
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,840
and that comes from like uh like a

946
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,159
background in different fields so i was

947
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,519
i've interned at the indian space

948
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
research organization designed things at

949
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,640
the mit media lab worked with financial

950
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
infrastructures at goldman sachs and

951
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,360
more importantly for this talk two

952
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,279
experiences with the google summer of

953
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,919
code where i worked on simulating a

954
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
martian rover like a mars rover and the

955
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,320
human factors involved in communication

956
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,880
with astronauts and rovers as well as

957
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,039
organizing complexity weekend which is

958
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,880
an event we do twice a year with the

959
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
best complexity applied complexity

960
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,840
scientists across the world this has

961
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
really led me to think how to best think

962
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
about cyber physical systems which are a

963
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
much more complex system than just cyber

964
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
systems so

965
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,279
if you look at the book that you

966
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
received with the

967
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,600
cycon package you'll find our paper on

968
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,760
page 347

969
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
but you do not need to read the paper to

970
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
attend this talk i assume no background

971
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
and yeah it will be a very gentle

972
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,039
introduction to everything so

973
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,000
so yeah

974
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,919
this has been repeated this message has

975
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
been repeated throughout this

976
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
event in which we started on the

977
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,480
workshop day with a very relevant

978
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,360
like talk and preparation by

979
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,000
members in ccdcoe so this

980
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,159
talk was about trust in cyber exercises

981
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,720
and the future vision for nato as they

982
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
go forward and this talk uh especially

983
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,640
focused on

984
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,679
the importance of cultural communication

985
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,120
the importance of

986
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,000
like interoperability between countries

987
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,399
the importance of collaboration over

988
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,360
competition or cooperation and concepts

989
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,399
like that so it was a really good look

990
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,320
at that from both a strategy point of

991
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
view and then it was followed by another

992
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,799
excellent talk which some of you might

993
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,719
have attended by

994
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,159
by dr max meads and that was an analysis

995
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,079
of the lock shields exercise and this

996
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
paper is the first paper in the book

997
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,399
that you received so this is the role of

998
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
military cyber exercises and the case

999
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
study for lock shields and this was

1000
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,199
particularly very exciting for me

1001
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
because this went into the history of

1002
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,918
locked shields and how exercises evolve

1003
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,000
we just assume that people

1004
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,520
like gabor and the team they just come

1005
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,679
gather gather around and organize an

1006
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,960
event like this

1007
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,719
but the history that has gone into

1008
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,879
events like this predates like a decade

1009
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,359
back so an exercise like lock shield

1010
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,399
started

1011
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,639
like soon after there were cyber attacks

1012
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,760
on estonia in 2007 and the first event

1013
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,679
that was conducted was the baltic cyber

1014
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,800
shield and 2012 onwards

1015
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,520
it's been called the log shields and we

1016
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,760
at singapore have followed like a very

1017
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,640
similar path which is very serendipitous

1018
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
because these two

1019
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,119
series of events happened independently

1020
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
and now they are in a sort of

1021
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,839
interdependence with each other so

1022
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,680
after doing and conducting all these

1023
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,880
exercises

1024
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
there's one thing we have realized that

1025
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,040
the role of cyber exercises in

1026
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
increasing our resilience

1027
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,599
is extremely clear but it's certainly

1028
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,079
not enough and i'll get into why

1029
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,839
this is because traditional cyber

1030
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
security is no longer enough you see on

1031
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,720
your screen that there's a whole

1032
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
a range of attacks which are purely

1033
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
cyber attacks then there's a whole bunch

1034
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,320
of attacks which are purely physical

1035
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,280
attacks

1036
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
which which the world is very

1037
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
good at planning and strategizing and

1038
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,160
thinking about since the last century

1039
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,800
or even the last thousand plus years now

1040
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
we are at a space where cyber and

1041
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
physical are no longer like independent

1042
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,480
things are systems around us like from

1043
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,640
the smart watch that i'm wearing to the

1044
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
phones that you have in your hands they

1045
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,400
are no longer just cyber or just

1046
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,440
physical they are completely a new thing

1047
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
of their own and when people say the

1048
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,359
real world they usually mean the

1049
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,359
physical world which is also no longer

1050
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,160
true most of our lives are spent in the

1051
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
digital world most of the decisions that

1052
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
countries take happen in the digital

1053
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
world and any manipulation with that

1054
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,400
digital world has physical world

1055
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
consequences so when i mention real

1056
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
world in the talk i refer to the cyber

1057
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,280
physical and not just the physical

1058
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,119
so you see some examples of cyber

1059
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
physical systems and just like the

1060
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
question you asked about satellites they

1061
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,640
are also very

1062
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,720
cyber physical systems they have some

1063
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
capability to maneuver through space

1064
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,440
they have sensors and actuators on board

1065
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
they have

1066
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
network links which can be compromised

1067
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,760
or hacked so anything from pacemakers

1068
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,599
which people have in their hearts which

1069
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,760
can be controlled by bluetooth and can

1070
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
be hacked and you can essentially

1071
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,839
like

1072
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,079
like kill someone as a result if

1073
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,880
if the pacemaker has an anomaly or if

1074
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
the pacemaker has been compromised by

1075
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
malicious actors

1076
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,280
two like large-scale country scale water

1077
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
treatment systems

1078
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
everything is driven by these

1079
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,280
communications which happen between

1080
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,240
sensors controllers actuators computers

1081
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,280
and this has large consequences in the

1082
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
future and this has been very clear in

1083
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
the attacks that we have seen in the

1084
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
last decade and more so in the last

1085
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
couple of years with the florida water

1086
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
treatment attack and the colonial

1087
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,560
pipeline attack these attacks may have

1088
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
origin may have their origins in the

1089
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,839
cybersphere but they had large

1090
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,040
consequences in the physical sphere

1091
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,599
so this became very clear in 2016 when

1092
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,760
nato recognized cyberspace as one of the

1093
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,440
domain of operations

1094
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
and

1095
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
this is because we had the four domains

1096
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,680
of warfare sea space air and land and

1097
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,640
then

1098
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
cyber was introduced by a lot of

1099
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,280
countries in that area and then here you

1100
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
see like weaponized social media and

1101
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,359
cultural engagement now this is

1102
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,680
something where memes play a huge role

1103
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,079
and things which we have seen play a

1104
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,560
huge impact in global elections as well

1105
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
as day-to-day dialogue now what happens

1106
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,920
is that cyber physical warfare is the

1107
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,320
next step so cyber physical defense and

1108
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,640
cyber physical exercises are obviously

1109
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
the next step for us to think about

1110
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,880
and this is why it's important to frame

1111
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
or define this term first

1112
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,680
so when the attack has its origin in the

1113
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,839
cyber domain in the information domain

1114
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,480
it's purely a cyber attack if the impact

1115
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,560
is also felt in the cyber domain so this

1116
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,160
can be something like just getting

1117
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,400
someone's passwords or just messing with

1118
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,839
your friend and changing their password

1119
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,040
on their phone

1120
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
but if the attack is purely in the

1121
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
physical domain and also has an impact

1122
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
in the physical domain such as me just

1123
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
drilling a hole in a tank in a water

1124
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,160
tank that's a purely physical attack now

1125
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,079
when we go to

1126
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,800
origin in the cyber domain and an impact

1127
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,320
in the physical domain that's when it

1128
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
becomes a cyber physical attack so

1129
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
this can be me just blowing a satellite

1130
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
up in space or attacking a remote water

1131
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
plant sitting here in estonia and

1132
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,280
causing a flood in my water test bed in

1133
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
singapore this is a cyber physical

1134
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
attack and this is the most popular

1135
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,079
style of attack that is going on today

1136
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,240
which we are not yet prepared but we

1137
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,040
have begun to think about and lastly

1138
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,920
there's this very under appreciated uh

1139
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
under explored area called the physical

1140
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
cyber attacks which we won't get into

1141
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
but it's important to mention so these

1142
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,359
attacks can have their origin in their

1143
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,920
physical domain like me just

1144
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
coming with a hammer and blowing the

1145
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
servers apart

1146
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,480
so this uh this has an impact in the

1147
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,240
cyber domain that the disks might get

1148
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
damaged my processors may not work as

1149
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
expected or i cause like changes in the

1150
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,680
voltage and that causes impact on the

1151
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,800
computer

1152
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
infrastructure of this of the entire

1153
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,920
facility

1154
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
or a very popular example is signal

1155
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,880
jamming i can just jam the signals off

1156
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
like all the communication devices here

1157
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,800
and that has an origin in the physical

1158
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,280
domain but an impact on the cyber domain

1159
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,560
so these are

1160
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
things which we can use to explore the

1161
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,480
whole range of cyber physical attacks so

1162
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
it's just important to explore what a

1163
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,119
cyber physical system really is and very

1164
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,520
simply it's anything with a sensor with

1165
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,720
an actuator and with some controllers

1166
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,359
which help to understand the physical

1167
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,800
world around us

1168
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
and then manipulate that world

1169
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
based on the logic that we have just

1170
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
come up with so that

1171
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
that manipulation is decided by

1172
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,040
controllers or computers so these can be

1173
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,720
very simple things like arduino

1174
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
microprocessors which kids use to

1175
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,280
program simple things to like

1176
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
even very advanced things like

1177
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
controlling nuclear plants or water

1178
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,440
plants so all of this is done by a

1179
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,920
supervisory controller which takes in

1180
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
inputs from all these

1181
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,520
smaller controllers and that's why it's

1182
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,400
called the supervisor and popularly it's

1183
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,240
known as the scada or the supervisory

1184
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
control and data acquisition unit so the

1185
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,839
abbreviations in this field are scada

1186
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,599
plc which is the programmable logic

1187
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
controllers these two are the only ones

1188
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,400
you need to be aware of for this talk

1189
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,119
and the reason the attack surface or the

1190
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,520
points of attack increase is because

1191
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,359
each of these things exists both in the

1192
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,960
physical realm as well as the

1193
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,079
cybersphere and all the letters small

1194
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,079
letters that you see here are points of

1195
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,880
attack these can be some things like

1196
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
supply chain attacks which start with

1197
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
anomalies in the micro chips itself

1198
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,920
which we may not be prepared for right

1199
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,079
up to like man in the middle attacks and

1200
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,319
all different sorts of network attacks

1201
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,200
so

1202
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,760
these things which can be at the scale

1203
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,839
of sensors or actuators or at the

1204
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,760
broader scale of control devices or

1205
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
utility devices these have broad

1206
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
consequences and this is why it's

1207
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,839
important to understand the difference

1208
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
between information technology i.t

1209
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,960
versus ot operational technology which

1210
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
is what industrial control systems and

1211
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,680
cyber physical systems are all about

1212
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
and this is why ccdcoe has been on top

1213
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,920
of this since the last many years and

1214
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,599
most of you would have seen this if you

1215
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,400
have

1216
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,280
attended cr14 or the cyber ranges

1217
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,520
in lock shields anytime

1218
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,720
so

1219
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,200
for what does it mean for all of you as

1220
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
people representing different countries

1221
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,040
these are our critical infrastructures

1222
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,880
and all of them are

1223
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,720
essentially controlled by these cyber

1224
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,880
physical systems increasingly

1225
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,040
to take an example closer to home these

1226
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,800
are singapore's critical information

1227
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
infrastructures and

1228
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,160
to counter that to protect these systems

1229
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,319
there is a whole of society defense

1230
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,400
approach which is called total defense

1231
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,079
and digital defense was one of the

1232
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,079
categories which was added in the recent

1233
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,560
years but since society is this

1234
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,119
interdependent complex being between

1235
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,599
technology economics culture and policy

1236
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,400
it's important to essentially understand

1237
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,079
the interplay between all of these

1238
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,240
things and come up with strategies to

1239
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,480
protect cyber attacks and cyber physical

1240
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,599
attacks

1241
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,560
so this talk is mostly about keeping

1242
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,480
calm and cyber exercising and

1243
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,960
introducing that as like a cultural

1244
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
practice among all critical

1245
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,119
infrastructures and countries around the

1246
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,560
world and

1247
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,880
the paper will go into like six years of

1248
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,800
cyber physical exercises and the

1249
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,440
exercises included are these ones so

1250
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
there's one exercise which we conduct

1251
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,760
every year at itrest in singapore and

1252
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,720
that's called the critical

1253
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,839
infrastructure security showdown or ciss

1254
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,440
then we take uh and transfer our

1255
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
learnings from locked shields which is

1256
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,160
an exercise conducted by ccdcoe and it's

1257
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,119
a blue team defensive uh exercise and we

1258
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,520
have been taking part we we were in the

1259
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,680
log shields 2020 planning

1260
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
events and we have taken part in 2021

1261
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,119
and 2022 which just concluded a couple

1262
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,680
months back and crossroads in which uh

1263
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,520
we met bb for the first time and that

1264
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
was like an eye-opening experience for

1265
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,200
training red teams and the importance of

1266
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,800
these two exercises independently and

1267
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,000
as a whole was very enlightening for us

1268
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,040
and

1269
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,359
also for the organizers of the exercise

1270
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,560
because they

1271
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
introduced a water system which is a

1272
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,640
special system for these exercises for

1273
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,960
the first time so

1274
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,680
so yeah all of this was built on more

1275
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,760
theoretical foundations which started in

1276
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,119
2015 where we had the same uh like test

1277
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
beds open at a much larger scale um in

1278
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,760
the future years so that was called

1279
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,319
sci-fi systems week or

1280
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,400
special systems

1281
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,119
or

1282
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,200
cyber physical systems special systems

1283
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,640
week so

1284
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,240
yeah this is the tv wall of ccdcoe which

1285
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,079
is used in lock shields and different

1286
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,119
exercises and you see our human machine

1287
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,400
interface or 24 blue teams here 24

1288
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,319
countries essentially or teams of

1289
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,520
countries

1290
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,280
trying to defend a water treatment

1291
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
system and the reason they are trying to

1292
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,720
do this is because attackers usually

1293
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,800
think in terms of networks and graphs

1294
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,720
and the relationship that different

1295
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,880
components have how is my tank connected

1296
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
to a wall how is my

1297
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,280
network link connected to a satellite

1298
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,800
how is my um shipyard connected to like

1299
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,359
the human who will be uh using who will

1300
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,000
be driving uh and using the truck to

1301
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,200
transport

1302
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,560
the

1303
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,280
the load so defenders instead have been

1304
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,119
traditionally thinking in terms of lists

1305
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,200
can i install a firewall with a list of

1306
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,760
rules and try to protect this link this

1307
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,599
link this link whereas attackers will

1308
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,760
always think uh in terms of like

1309
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,079
networks and graphs and they will be

1310
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,480
always be one step ahead because they

1311
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,319
have like a different view of the entire

1312
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,160
system so if we want to be good

1313
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,400
defenders we have to think about how

1314
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
things are related and we do that um at

1315
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,079
itrest with examples like this so this

1316
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,560
is essentially any cyberphysical system

1317
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,040
and the red devil emoji is essentially

1318
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,280
points of attack which can be

1319
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,839
network attacks between links

1320
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,640
and

1321
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,000
that's why it's important for us to

1322
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
monitor each of these points

1323
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,319
so the broader thesis of that is we have

1324
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,800
to monitor all the attack points as a

1325
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,000
good defender and then visualize these

1326
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
the security and operations and safety

1327
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
conditions in a very uh accessible

1328
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
interface not just for technical

1329
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,800
operators but also strategists and

1330
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
policy makers so

1331
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
this is what we have been doing at swot

1332
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
which is secure water treatment testbed

1333
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,599
at itrest and we

1334
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,240
have a whole bunch of sensors such as

1335
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
this flow meter which measures the flow

1336
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,440
of water and an actuator and these

1337
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,480
things look um like this when

1338
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,520
when seen from a like computer graphical

1339
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,640
user interface and uh the reason these

1340
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
things look like something straight from

1341
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,880
the 90s is because there has been no

1342
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,359
major innovation in like design and user

1343
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,760
experience in this field so what we have

1344
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
done is we have come up with like

1345
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,599
modifications to these

1346
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,839
hmis or human machine interfaces and

1347
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,079
added detectors and

1348
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,079
more technologies to make it more

1349
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,640
obvious for operators to understand if

1350
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,720
there's an anomaly or an attack going on

1351
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,880
and we have been doing that not just for

1352
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
water treatment but

1353
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,400
different test beds such as water

1354
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,000
distribution

1355
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
internet of things and an electric power

1356
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,400
test bed all of these which will be used

1357
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
in exercises and have been used

1358
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,079
so this started with

1359
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,640
an event back in 2015 called the sci-fi

1360
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,079
week or the secure cyber physical

1361
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,440
systems week and we wrapped up last year

1362
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,559
with ciss 2021 where we collected 85

1363
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,480
hours of data

1364
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
which was which is not

1365
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,800
it does not seem like a lot but that was

1366
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
multiple red teams attacking throughout

1367
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,280
the week and we had one more than a

1368
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,920
terabyte of data in the form of packets

1369
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,440
collected and

1370
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,920
0.32 gb of operational technology data

1371
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,839
and we have opened up these data sets

1372
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,160
for anyone to access once you request

1373
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,400
from the itres website and the

1374
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,480
distribution for that has been something

1375
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
that you see on the screen so it's a

1376
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
very balanced red teaming blue teaming

1377
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,920
exercise with a few judges and technical

1378
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,839
staff from the green team and lock

1379
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,800
shields has a very similar model and it

1380
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,319
has been interesting to observe the

1381
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,640
similarities and differences between the

1382
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
way exercises can be conducted and the

1383
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
reason we do

1384
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,559
we have such a balanced

1385
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,319
way of approaching this is because we

1386
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,720
want to capture all the

1387
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,800
aspects of the nist framework or the

1388
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
nist framework which essentially helps

1389
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,520
us describe the security posture of any

1390
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,440
critical infrastructure so it's

1391
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,359
important to not just identify assets

1392
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,839
but also protect them detect against any

1393
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
anomalies or attacks respond to these

1394
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,760
attacks and then recover from these

1395
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,920
attacks to ensure that the security

1396
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,760
safety and service of your

1397
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
infrastructure as well as the people and

1398
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,720
the operations is preserved

1399
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,640
so we do that with a whole bunch of

1400
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
technologies which we won't get into in

1401
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,160
this paper but you can definitely come

1402
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,079
to our booth after the talk to learn

1403
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,800
more about it but the idea is that you

1404
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,880
need a holistic set of tools and

1405
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,680
technologies and procedures

1406
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,599
to essentially counter that because

1407
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,839
attackers are getting smart at every

1408
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,839
step of this skill chain so if some of

1409
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,599
you are familiar with the miter attack

1410
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,800
framework

1411
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,599
this is an easier representation of that

1412
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,720
which is

1413
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,559
like a very recent pyramid called the

1414
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,400
techniques tactics techniques and

1415
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,480
procedures pyramid which goes into

1416
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,240
increasing levels of detail like what

1417
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,400
command was launched to what strategy

1418
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,720
did the attacker have more broadly and

1419
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,200
this leads us into more of a purple

1420
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,920
teaming mindset which is something

1421
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,760
that's inspired from both the red team

1422
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
as well as the blue teams in which you

1423
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,920
act both as a blue team and the red team

1424
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,200
depending on

1425
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,240
what area needs more attention and once

1426
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,920
you do all these things once you

1427
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,240
understand the state of

1428
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,559
the system through not just attack but

1429
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
also defense you lead to a more secure

1430
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,960
design and this

1431
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,119
help leads us into the mitre playbook in

1432
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,920
which you identify and hold an ipc or an

1433
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,680
initial planning conference then a main

1434
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,599
planning conference then you conduct the

1435
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,440
exercise through something like partners

1436
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,359
run in lock shields and then the final

1437
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,040
exercise itself

1438
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,119
for us it has looked something like this

1439
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,720
so if this is your first time conducting

1440
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,280
a exercise you can read more about it in

1441
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,760
the paper so it's steps which are

1442
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,839
mentioned here such as communicate and

1443
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,839
coordinate implement green team systems

1444
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,400
implement it and ot protocols create a

1445
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,040
digital twin if you need to provide a

1446
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,119
database then design the human machine

1447
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
interfaces design and develop attacks

1448
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,200
for red teams implement anomaly

1449
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,280
detection and create test plans and

1450
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,119
update the code so

1451
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,119
this has helped us understand the

1452
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,040
increased importance of these techniques

1453
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,280
tactics and procedures not just across

1454
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,200
twins the importance of digital twins

1455
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,000
but also user experience detectors and

1456
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the need for protectors or safety

1457
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
instrumentation systems so you might

1458
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,160
have seen just four names on the paper

1459
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,319
but none of this would be possible with

1460
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,480
an entire village of people who have

1461
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,760
supported us

1462
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,839
in this journey including people here at

1463
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,839
ccdcoe so so your thanks to all of you

1464
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,359
and this all started in 2019 when uh

1465
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,839
ccdcoe also visited dietris for one of

1466
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,920
our exercises uh in

1467
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,839
before before covid so this was cis 2019

1468
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,920
and it was a very proud moment for us

1469
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,359
when our blue team systems the hmi

1470
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,480
are were represented in lock shields for

1471
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,319
the first time and one last thing before

1472
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,440
i wrap up the talk ciss 22 is happening

1473
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,680
later this year and this will be the

1474
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,280
first time in which we'll have three

1475
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,599
systems not just one but three systems

1476
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,359
interconnected for red teams and blue

1477
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,480
teams to

1478
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,119
play against so yeah that's the talk if

1479
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,280
you want to know more about

1480
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,640
the work at itrest or me you can just

1481
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,119
take a picture of that and reach out or

1482
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,040
talk to us at the booth outside or after

1483
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
the talk that's right thank you thank

1484
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,079
you sid

1485
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,880
you got a very condensed and archived

1486
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,960
version of the information he has a lot

1487
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,160
of things to uh to tell so make sure you

1488
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,480
visit his uh booth and talk to him and

1489
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,800
also the rest of the i trust crowd

1490
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,119
uh when looking at the crowd during your

1491
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,440
presentation i've been on the other side

1492
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
as well this is just

1493
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,000
gabor invited me to sit in this chair

1494
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,240
but i saw a lot of people taking

1495
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
pictures of your slides meaning that

1496
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,920
they do have some importance in in there

1497
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,200
so

1498
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,119
although the water is a common theme in

1499
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,319
this

1500
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,160
in this session this panel although you

1501
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,000
might not know about it we have

1502
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,640
shipyards we have water what are the

1503
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,319
purification distribution systems and

1504
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,000
eyebrows will talk about the water as

1505
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,079
well

1506
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,559
however i want to just to slightly dive

1507
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,720
deeper you mentioned the concept of the

1508
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,160
digital twin and digital shadow in your

1509
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,079
specifically this came from you

1510
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,480
and how is digital twin or digital

1511
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,040
shadow understood specifically in your

1512
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,040
uh exercises that you do

1513
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,760
yeah that's a great question so

1514
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,720
when we started thinking about um like

1515
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,040
how do you even implement a complex

1516
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,880
system like a six stage water treatment

1517
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,160
plant the first step was not to like

1518
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,800
model every physical process itself but

1519
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,200
to take readings from an actual

1520
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,960
operational water plant which which is

1521
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
the physical test bed that we built and

1522
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,440
then input that into like a visualizer

1523
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,240
like a virtual reality uh kind of a 3d

1524
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,480
visualization which people can just

1525
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,880
understand and remotely

1526
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,040
observe and operate remotely if they

1527
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,680
want to so that's more of a digital

1528
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,319
shadow in which we take inputs from

1529
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,760
from an operational system and it's

1530
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,839
essentially just shadowing the actions

1531
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,920
of the of the physical system then

1532
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,520
professor aditya matru who is in the

1533
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,920
audience here he started work on

1534
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,800
implementing the digital twin in which

1535
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
what happens when you want to provide

1536
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,960
your test bed or infrastructure to not

1537
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,680
just one team one blue team but 24 blue

1538
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,760
teams you cannot provide one physical

1539
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,720
test bed to 24 blue teams to attack at

1540
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,559
the same time or defend it at the same

1541
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,119
time because there will be conflicts um

1542
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,960
like there will be priority conflicts as

1543
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,359
well as many other operational issues

1544
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,240
with that so for that we need a digital

1545
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,880
uh version of the plant or the test bed

1546
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,520
or a purely um like replicable um purely

1547
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,119
extendable

1548
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,599
virtualizable instance of the plant

1549
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
which i can deploy not just on my own

1550
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,400
computer but on the cloud for any

1551
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,720
educational institution to use for any

1552
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,640
government to use or for

1553
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,880
an exercise like lock shields where 24

1554
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,440
blue teams play together so

1555
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,680
so yeah that's why it was important in

1556
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,839
the last couple of years to develop not

1557
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,960
just

1558
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,440
the shadow but as well as

1559
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,599
like model those physical process like

1560
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,319
how does the formula for flow which

1561
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,480
takes into account gravity and all these

1562
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,359
concepts from physics apply to this

1563
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,440
to this digital world and then also

1564
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,000
model the network traffic and accurately

1565
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
represent um industrial protocols like

1566
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,280
opc ua which is used popularly

1567
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,680
increasingly being used in all critical

1568
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,599
infrastructures so how do we re how do

1569
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,839
we make it such that attackers or

1570
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,359
defenders cannot tell the difference

1571
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,920
between the actual operational real

1572
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,880
physical thing um or the real cyber

1573
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,280
physical thing which is the digital twin

1574
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,359
right so yeah right thank you i'm going

1575
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,559
to take also the questions from the

1576
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,280
audience if there is anyone

1577
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,839
look look oh i was pointing pointing at

1578
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,799
you but it's actually luke

1579
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,720
so yeah okay first of all

1580
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,559
uh

1581
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,839
sorry go ahead

1582
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,960
okay so uh this uh

1583
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,599
this panel is recorded and just to bite

1584
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,720
some click

1585
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,799
for us i've been taking part in log

1586
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,359
shoots for four times five times and uh

1587
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,200
as a green teamer

1588
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,680
i have never defended any system never

1589
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,280
attacked any system

1590
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,240
and i always have the question how to

1591
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,960
how to defend the system against

1592
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,680
red teams i do not know but now i have a

1593
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,319
chance to ask how to defend your digital

1594
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,920
twin in

1595
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,480
in lock shields against the red teams

1596
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,440
because

1597
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,760
this is the this is the aim i think that

1598
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,680
we have to to serve

1599
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,480
thanks yeah firstly that's an excellent

1600
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,119
question because we always approach

1601
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,480
things with the

1602
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,640
mindset of an attacker which is great

1603
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,880
like offensive security is how you find

1604
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,520
weaknesses or holes in any system but

1605
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
the next step is how do you harden these

1606
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,160
systems how do you plug these holes and

1607
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,079
essentially stop future attacks from

1608
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,559
happening so most of the practices that

1609
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,799
people have learned in the cyber space

1610
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,200
which is information security they still

1611
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,280
apply because the points of entry of

1612
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,599
most of these attacks are still

1613
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,680
like cyber security strategies that

1614
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,000
attackers use so these can be simple

1615
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,880
things

1616
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,040
like hardening your firewalls

1617
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,359
understanding that there's no

1618
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,520
like ports open which shouldn't be open

1619
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,280
and things like that and then

1620
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,359
understanding is there any operational

1621
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,839
or process based weakness in the system

1622
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,240
like is is it possible that if i just

1623
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,880
overflow a tank in stage one it will

1624
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
have cascading consequences in stage

1625
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,520
four now this is something new which

1626
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,599
operational technology defenders have to

1627
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,400
learn

1628
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,720
what is the process like so when a blue

1629
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,440
team blue team participant approaches an

1630
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,440
it system they have a very standard

1631
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,480
playbook

1632
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,880
in which they have like these six steps

1633
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,799
to follow is the firewall okay is the

1634
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,720
port working fine are the services

1635
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,400
configured correctly and things like

1636
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,559
that but when they approach

1637
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,440
an operational test bed it's a different

1638
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,000
like bag of tricks for every operational

1639
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,680
system or at least like different

1640
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,319
classes of tricks because every fluid

1641
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,880
based system is different like water oil

1642
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,799
all these systems they have similar

1643
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,400
behavior because they are all liquids

1644
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,319
essentially but when you are defending

1645
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,119
an electric uh grid or power system you

1646
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,280
cannot be that relaxed with your defense

1647
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,680
strategy because any attack happens in a

1648
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,680
millisecond and you need to have

1649
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,799
different

1650
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,200
strategies to counter against that so we

1651
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,440
are still in that phase in this whole

1652
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,119
community in which we have to come up

1653
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,440
with like a better playbook for blue

1654
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,680
team systems and there's already efforts

1655
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,680
in that direction in red team it's

1656
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,280
called the mitre framework in which

1657
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,079
that's a very very easy to understand

1658
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,240
approach to approach red teaming for

1659
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,079
blue teaming we have to come up with

1660
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,440
something

1661
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,079
that can be like a theme for a futures

1662
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,720
icon right thank you for the answer yeah

1663
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,119
luke yeah uh my question is about the

1664
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,760
the physics of things so uh we also

1665
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,799
include uh plcs in in our exercises and

1666
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,880
uh i think it was four years ago we did

1667
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,000
the gas pipeline and we ended up uh

1668
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,400
mimicking several sort of pipelines and

1669
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,079
valves and sensors and the attack was

1670
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,880
against the uh the plc and we ended up

1671
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,440
uh realizing that we have to essentially

1672
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,160
model the physics so pv equals nrt and

1673
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
all this stuff but even more complex

1674
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,079
because if we started to shut the valve

1675
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,319
here how fast would the pressure drop

1676
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,520
over there over 40 kilometers say so all

1677
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,280
of this you and if you want to do the

1678
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
simulation correctly then you've got to

1679
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,200
model the physics yeah and and then

1680
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,880
you're in an exercise you want to run a

1681
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,240
test run of it you want to make sure the

1682
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,400
physics are good so but you don't want

1683
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,720
to wait two days for for events to

1684
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,480
happen so how do you deal with uh

1685
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,319
collectively building up the physical

1686
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,640
model of reality to allow the use of a

1687
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,520
digital twin uh in an exercise

1688
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,200
firstly that's an excellent question

1689
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,680
that is an extension of what bb asked me

1690
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,880
like why do we need a digital twin we

1691
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,119
need it because we can't wait

1692
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,680
a day to replicate the actions that

1693
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,920
actually take a day in a digital twin

1694
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,880
you can

1695
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,319
essentially simulate uh an ear of plant

1696
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,880
behavior in a day or you can just speed

1697
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,440
the digital twin hundred times um and

1698
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,079
just essentially see what uh actions

1699
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,160
take place in a plant throughout the day

1700
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,119
so this uh can be modeled not just by

1701
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,920
physics but also like chemistry like in

1702
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,960
our water

1703
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,760
system we have ph sensors conductivity

1704
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,079
sensors and all the chemical processes

1705
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,839
which need to be modeled by chemical

1706
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,640
equations so these physical systems are

1707
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,280
mostly dependent on time and because we

1708
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,520
have the like privilege to play with

1709
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,760
time in the digital space which we do

1710
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,839
not in the physical space digital twins

1711
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,720
become this very exciting area where we

1712
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,960
can essentially forecast which what will

1713
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,200
happen if these initial conditions are

1714
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,280
configured and i'm setting the twin to

1715
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,359
run at 100 times the speed it's like

1716
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,079
watching a movie at 1.5 x 2 x if you are

1717
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,119
short on time so that really helps in

1718
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,280
not just reconnaissance after an attack

1719
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,640
takes place but also um like forecasting

1720
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,480
what will happen in the future and

1721
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,640
predicting the consequences yes so this

1722
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,079
is very good but uh what about the

1723
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,599
framework to do this are you aware

1724
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,359
because i mean you you're so much to be

1725
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,599
modeled is there some kind of standard

1726
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,160
was that your question

1727
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,720
are there standards in here is there a

1728
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,079
plug-in play where i can just come in

1729
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,240
with an equation or something and then

1730
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,200
model some part of it yeah definitely so

1731
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,119
yeah professor aditya can describe that

1732
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,599
in a lot more detail so you can meet him

1733
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,440
after after the talk but i'll give you

1734
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,559
the tldr short version of that which is

1735
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,040
uh that when we were building this test

1736
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,680
bed we knew how the

1737
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,720
reactions and equations uh were modeled

1738
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,559
because we had to build the physical

1739
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,520
thing

1740
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,119
like as a whole and all these

1741
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,119
programmable logic controllers they take

1742
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,359
into account these equations when they

1743
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,960
have to decide on the logic like if the

1744
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,039
water is low if the pump is off if the

1745
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,280
valve is closed these things have to uh

1746
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,559
happen so when deci designing any such

1747
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,039
physical test bed all these equations

1748
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,359
are considered so it's the same

1749
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,920
equations which are then converted in a

1750
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,200
programmable

1751
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,839
like logical form and represented that

1752
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,760
way so the framework comes from like

1753
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,160
systems design which is used for

1754
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,559
constructing these test beds as well

1755
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,599
and it varies from plant to plant right

1756
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,839
i will as a moderator i'll have to put

1757
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,319
an end to this unfortunately this is a

1758
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,799
good discussion but we have to honor the

1759
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,319
time when we have to move onwards

1760
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,559
however please do

1761
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,799
visit them at the itrest booth and

1762
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,440
torture them more

1763
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,160
347 exactly

1764
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,079
unfortunately and now

1765
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,240
and now for some something completely

1766
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,960
different still staying on the water

1767
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,559
theme i welcome on stage i bars he is a

1768
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,720
phd student and a research fellow at

1769
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,240
norwegian university of science and

1770
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,680
technology

1771
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,640
oh he has a very long experience uh

1772
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,400
working with the

1773
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,160
in even in the ship

1774
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,280
engine room and also on the shore so

1775
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,680
please the crowd is yours

1776
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,760
thank you for the introduction bibi

1777
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,839
marhaba

1778
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:32,240
hello thank you for joining us today

1779
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,319
i will start my presentation immediately

1780
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,200
i will talk about our

1781
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,920
papers published a couple of months ago

1782
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,680
by the journal of marine science

1783
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,039
engineering

1784
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,640
and

1785
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,680
we were i am not alone for this paper we

1786
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,079
wrote this paper together with

1787
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,319
associate professor vasilisky carlos and

1788
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,440
also professor socrates casicas

1789
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,680
the title of our paper is towards a

1790
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,760
cyber physical range for the integrated

1791
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,680
navigation system

1792
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,839
what is the purpose of this paper we try

1793
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,559
to understand the requirements of a

1794
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,640
testbed for the integrated navigation

1795
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,839
system what's that in circuits of

1796
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,520
navigation system

1797
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,599
it is a system and combines the

1798
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,119
information receiving from

1799
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,839
different components such as as gps

1800
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,839
actors and others

1801
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,400
to improve the safe navigation for

1802
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,319
conventional vessels

1803
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,920
and it includes six tasks these are

1804
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,200
detailedly

1805
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
described by the international maritime

1806
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,720
organization

1807
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,640
with some circulars

1808
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,960
and the requirements for the collision

1809
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,720
avoidance and route monitoring is

1810
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,480
totally mandatory for an ins some of the

1811
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,640
requirements of the navigation control

1812
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,520
data and alert managements are

1813
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,359
mandatory again

1814
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,359
and root planning and navigation

1815
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,200
citations and data display these

1816
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,839
requirements for such tasks are optional

1817
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,200
our research consists of two parts in

1818
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,839
the first part we investigated the

1819
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,760
integrated navigation systems in

1820
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,640
different aspects such as components

1821
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,119
sub-components services communication

1822
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,079
protocols interfaces dependencies and

1823
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,599
connections data and data flow

1824
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,640
we find a basement for this resort

1825
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,200
because each manufacturer has different

1826
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,280
viewpoints some class requirements has

1827
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,160
different uh requirements

1828
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,920
that's why we selected the imo

1829
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,400
requirements because it is the

1830
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,520
gut of the maritime

1831
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,920
and to access the rules current rules

1832
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,160
and regulations we use the imo vega

1833
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,480
database offered by the international

1834
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,720
maritime organization and dnv

1835
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,920
in the second part of our research

1836
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,680
we look at the bridge testbeds in the

1837
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,920
literature in different dimensions such

1838
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,160
as capabilities and functionalities

1839
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,000
hardware components monitoring and

1840
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,920
management tools simulation and

1841
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,319
emulation tools architectural models

1842
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,480
research analysis comparison of test

1843
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,640
band and potentiality for cyber security

1844
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,359
of attachments and we made a

1845
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,520
systematic literature review to reach

1846
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,880
out to relevant

1847
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,520
publications in the literature

1848
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,119
and finally we found 16 publications in

1849
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,599
the literature between the 2014 and

1850
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,880
2020. before the 2014 there were no

1851
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,640
publications

1852
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,559
regarding the british test paths and

1853
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,119
finally we combined our extracted

1854
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,000
knowledge with the paper off towards a

1855
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,920
cyber physical range for the integrated

1856
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,079
navigation system however in this

1857
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,599
presentation you will take more than

1858
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,160
this paper

1859
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,400
firstly we look at the components

1860
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
however international maritime

1861
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,720
organization doesn't have a component

1862
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,280
list for an ins because there are

1863
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,920
several factors such as the size of the

1864
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,440
vessel as a volume or as a lens or a

1865
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,319
navigation zone that's why we look at

1866
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,400
the relevant circulars relevant

1867
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,200
conventions and we try to find the

1868
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,359
components as many as possible and

1869
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,640
finally we find 25 components developed

1870
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,960
by developed for different proposals

1871
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,839
such as positioning such as to receive

1872
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,079
methodological information

1873
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,839
or heading information

1874
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,039
and then we look at the sub components

1875
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,960
imo defines only the performance

1876
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,000
criterias actually they don't interested

1877
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,039
in how it works typically and for

1878
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,680
example actors act as an electronical

1879
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,079
chart and we divide into two groups as a

1880
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,200
hardware and software and hardware

1881
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,280
monitoring it processor in it and

1882
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,960
controlling it

1883
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,440
software electronical chart active

1884
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,680
software and operating system of course

1885
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,280
you can go deep

1886
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,880
more deep however

1887
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,920
for us it was adequate

1888
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,920
and services service means functions and

1889
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,440
we look at the

1890
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,160
imr requirements again to define each

1891
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,799
component for one of them is ecosander

1892
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,119
is to measure and

1893
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,600
give the reliable information

1894
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,439
about the depth of the water under the

1895
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,879
kill under the westerly amine

1896
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,198
communication protocols vessels are

1897
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,719
communicate uh with other vessels and

1898
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,880
sure through the different

1899
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,359
uh protocols through the satellite for

1900
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,319
example or to do some antennas and

1901
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,719
another story is actually how the

1902
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,359
companies communicate with each other

1903
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,759
interfaces there is no any interface

1904
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,279
list for

1905
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,359
in terms of the international maritime

1906
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,679
organization that's why we look at the

1907
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,799
manufacturer brochures and we found some

1908
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,759
interfaces such as ethernet port or usb

1909
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,439
port or some ports for the serial

1910
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,319
communication

1911
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,520
dependencies we reviewed all performance

1912
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,600
criterias performance standards of the

1913
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,319
ima for each components

1914
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,279
and

1915
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,319
for example for the radar we found that

1916
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,479
it is depends on gyro compass or

1917
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,158
transmission heading device ais epfs is

1918
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,158
this electronic position fixing system

1919
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,399
actually it is uh

1920
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:32,719
like gnss system or aileron system

1921
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,560
and speed and distance measuring

1922
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,040
equipment

1923
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,679
and finally we reach out that

1924
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,920
seven components depends on different

1925
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,560
components

1926
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,759
produced data everybody knows that gps

1927
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,000
uh give us a position information

1928
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,080
however for the international maritime

1929
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
organization it is not adequate

1930
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,920
according to the international maritime

1931
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,320
organization gps must provide also time

1932
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,600
information

1933
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,920
cpt information speed our grant or

1934
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,840
course information course over grant

1935
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,640
and finally we made a model for an ins

1936
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,120
and in this model you can see different

1937
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,800
uh locations for example monkey island

1938
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,679
it is the roof of the vessel actually

1939
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,280
or the bridge

1940
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,640
is the center bridge and with wings and

1941
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,320
what about under kill there are some

1942
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,560
transducers also we try to show some

1943
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,120
communication protocols between the

1944
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,159
terrestrial system between the satellite

1945
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,320
system we would like to show the

1946
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,640
communication protocols between the

1947
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,800
vessels vessel to vessel

1948
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,199
and we would like to show the position

1949
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,920
of some components for example some

1950
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,840
antenna units or

1951
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,000
magnetic compass are in the

1952
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,840
monkey island but there's some

1953
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,760
microphones is the starboard side for

1954
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,360
side wall side and the outside

1955
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,320
then

1956
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,080
we look at the bridge test in the

1957
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,320
literature and we found that two bridge

1958
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,920
test beds are available in the

1959
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,080
literature uh

1960
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,400
they are developing for performance

1961
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,719
tests of the components to develop new

1962
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,800
technologies and to make a risk

1963
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,440
assessment and one of which is

1964
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,440
recognized by the ilr i will mention

1965
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,719
about what

1966
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,040
it is

1967
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,920
the testbeds are mobile designed as a

1968
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,239
mobile or fix it

1969
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,880
real components or mimi compo mimic

1970
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,600
sensor data can be used

1971
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,320
and some tools for the monitoring or 3d

1972
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,440
creations

1973
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,159
it is also possible

1974
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,960
ayala ayala is the one of the most

1975
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,440
important maritime organizations in the

1976
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,360
world and it is recognized by the

1977
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,679
international maritime organization it

1978
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,800
is granted with consultative societies

1979
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,920
and emer bridge has pat emery time

1980
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,159
integrated reference platform developed

1981
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,880
by oldenburg universe in germany

1982
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,400
recognized by

1983
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,080
the iola however it is not used for the

1984
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,440
cyber security studies

1985
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,719
they have a fixed platform it's a really

1986
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,840
large container with some antenna units

1987
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,640
there is another container what's

1988
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,000
smaller one however it is it offers

1989
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,640
again the mobility for example in this

1990
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,040
photo you can see that this container is

1991
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,000
are

1992
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,280
on deck and service

1993
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,320
also they can move their test beds

1994
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,759
with some aluminium bags

1995
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,520
another test patch is developed by the

1996
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,560
hyundai

1997
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,600
when i

1998
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,239
uh use the real components

1999
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,040
on vessels in service

2000
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,480
what is the drawbacks for our

2001
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,640
researchers to find a vessel

2002
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,600
because

2003
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,080
maritime sector is a conservative sector

2004
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,159
and they they are not open for the

2005
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,719
research or for uh

2006
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,080
collaboration cooperations

2007
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,440
collaborations and however for hyundai

2008
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,360
it was not difficult because

2009
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,800
they

2010
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,679
construct ships and also they operate

2011
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,600
ships and also they develop some

2012
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,000
technologies and for a technology

2013
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,760
developed by them

2014
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,199
they use a real vessels

2015
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,800
and here you can see their

2016
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,440
schematic diagram their test environment

2017
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
as you can see there are some real

2018
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,520
components on board ships such as ais

2019
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,280
radar gps and other real marine

2020
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,840
components

2021
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,360
of course you can use also some

2022
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,360
simulations in your test beds for

2023
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,120
different proposals one of them is

2024
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,800
environment what is the environment

2025
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,080
firstly

2026
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,440
you can

2027
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,199
you can need a geographical position

2028
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,400
geographical map and also you need

2029
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,280
weather conditions you can create some c

2030
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,440
conditions you can make some scenarios

2031
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,640
with them

2032
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,640
and traffic simulations you need to

2033
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,120
create some you need to put some vessels

2034
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,080
which kind of vessels tankers containers

2035
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,360
dry cargo vessels which one

2036
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,080
and embedded simulator it is regarding

2037
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,120
the movement of the vessel it is like

2038
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,040
through the starboard side port side or

2039
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,679
to both side or outside like this

2040
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,239
you can stimulate the behavior of the

2041
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,120
vessel with anybody simulator and sensor

2042
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,679
simulations of course sensor simulations

2043
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,040
means iis simulation gps simulations

2044
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,480
anamator simulations and others

2045
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,800
you can create some virtual components

2046
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
of what is for example for the main

2047
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,880
propulsion system or thruster system

2048
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,800
some steering system what is the benefit

2049
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,480
of the virtual

2050
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,760
controls

2051
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,520
you can carry it easy

2052
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,199
also maybe you can use a tesla one and

2053
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,360
you can occupy this song with several

2054
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,480
components such as a system some cameras

2055
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,000
some

2056
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,960
weather sensors and you can transmit the

2057
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,120
collected data through a

2058
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,599
router to your net to your lap

2059
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,120
we tested the bridge command is an open

2060
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,880
source software actually it was first

2061
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,840
time used by the email bridge

2062
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,280
and

2063
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,040
we found that

2064
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,640
it is it acts like a real ship network

2065
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,159
of course it is too limited however

2066
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,199
it can be usable somehow and also you

2067
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,040
can combine it with

2068
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,000
some

2069
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,440
chip controller units as well

2070
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,320
and another software we tested

2071
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,120
nba simulator it is

2072
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,880
it actually broadcasts more

2073
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,239
ship network

2074
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,400
however visualization is limited or

2075
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,799
limited to compared to bridge comment

2076
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,360
opencpn is an electronic chart is used

2077
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,600
by the amateur cifers

2078
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,280
and also some

2079
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,960
ship pilots

2080
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,120
however you can connect your real

2081
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,679
components or you can use some ma

2082
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,400
simulator or bridge comment to this

2083
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,719
software and you can

2084
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,719
take the nba messages you can collect

2085
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,040
the enemy messages you can see the

2086
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,719
reaction of the

2087
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,159
simulators in the open cpn

2088
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,280
another one during your research during

2089
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,679
your study you can need data set and one

2090
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,000
of them of course the ais dataset and

2091
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,960
norwegian coastal administration uh

2092
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,800
offers their aes data free of charge

2093
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,600
through an ip address and port number

2094
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,920
use of present letter

2095
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,840
as i remember the first time mentioned

2096
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,760
about mentioned by the plymouth

2097
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,199
universities and researchers in the

2098
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,840
plymouth university they also mention

2099
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,400
about the drawbacks and advantages what

2100
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,360
is the

2101
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,360
drawbacks for example

2102
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
the maritime departments are

2103
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,360
used the bristol letters for training

2104
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,800
purposes

2105
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,880
and if you damage their simulators their

2106
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,600
trainings will be delayed and also these

2107
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,920
are costly equipments

2108
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,120
uh it is really hard to touch the

2109
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,640
simulators in terms of i mean coding

2110
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,800
however it is a ready system

2111
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,360
and that's why you don't need active

2112
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,360
software for example radar software it

2113
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,199
is ready to use

2114
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,880
general university has a huge project

2115
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,040
actually and one of them regarding the

2116
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,960
cyber security studies they're also

2117
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,199
planning to combine their

2118
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,520
full mission bridge simulator and cyber

2119
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,600
range

2120
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,480
as i know still an ongoing project

2121
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,679
taltec

2122
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,719
taltec also use a build simulator

2123
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,239
for their

2124
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,678
cyber security studies

2125
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,040
and now

2126
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,159
they have another test environment they

2127
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,840
are planning to make some research for

2128
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,679
the maritime cyber security studies

2129
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,560
maybe

2130
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,239
during the cafe time they can give us

2131
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,080
more information about their test paths

2132
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,320
as well

2133
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,120
and uh anthony

2134
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,040
our university marine department

2135
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,880
purchased a simulator for the cyber

2136
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,800
security studies uh in particular

2137
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,920
around six months ago

2138
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,600
and we started to work on it i would

2139
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,360
like to share

2140
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,880
our initial findings with you firstly

2141
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,360
it is possible to connect with real

2142
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,320
bridge components

2143
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,199
like

2144
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,080
gps a real components you can combine

2145
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,360
and we review the network traffic and it

2146
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,159
is compliance with the standards

2147
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,840
then another one

2148
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,440
we found

2149
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,440
in the front side

2150
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,480
15 different kind of components however

2151
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,800
when we look at the network traffic it

2152
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,840
is less than sin for example heading

2153
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,920
information is provided by the gyro

2154
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,000
compass on a real ship

2155
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,480
however and in the front side we can see

2156
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,800
we see the gyrocompass

2157
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,960
however when we look at the network

2158
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,640
traffic this data is produced by the gps

2159
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,080
message

2160
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,640
messages

2161
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,679
we are trying to

2162
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,120
uh

2163
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,520
understand how we can create a remote

2164
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,159
connection opportunity this are one of

2165
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,520
the problem because the marine

2166
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,600
department is different city in the

2167
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,719
difference

2168
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,120
than us and maybe

2169
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,520
a remote connection could be also better

2170
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,600
for us maybe also better for

2171
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,280
our stakeholders

2172
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,280
then another one these potential

2173
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,880
scenarios

2174
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,600
how can we create some scenarios using a

2175
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,320
simulator this is our next question

2176
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,520
actually

2177
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,400
and

2178
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,080
we are trying to understand the

2179
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,760
combination of the simulator with

2180
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,400
some tools some cyber security tools or

2181
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,199
some

2182
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,239
data sets how can we combine them this

2183
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,919
is our next question

2184
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,760
thank you for listening me if you have

2185
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,480
any questions maybe

2186
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,760
okay

2187
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,440
then maybe you can ask during the cafe

2188
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,600
right um before i open the floor to the

2189
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,080
questions so thank you take the seat

2190
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,520
as uh

2191
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,199
okay maybe here you don't need a warm-up

2192
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,560
but every

2193
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,440
big rock band needs a warm-up questions

2194
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,080
so there you go i'll start with the with

2195
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,440
the question that

2196
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,719
i have prepared i have multiple

2197
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,560
questions for every one of you so thank

2198
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
you so much um

2199
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,080
so you are

2200
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,000
looking at the concept of that the

2201
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,480
simulators who are designed primarily to

2202
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,159
train the crew on the operating the

2203
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,159
vessel and now trying to look how those

2204
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:21,159
simulators can be adjusted uh to train

2205
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:24,000
cybersecurity of the vessel right

2206
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,520
at least that's the in the nutshell what

2207
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,520
i understood and you say nodding so it

2208
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,800
means okay so i understood right

2209
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,400
the first question i have how close the

2210
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,920
those replicas are to the actual systems

2211
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,800
and

2212
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,560
if there are already test beds and the

2213
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,960
individual components exist why would

2214
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,880
you need to struggle and create testbed

2215
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,360
with with the full equipment yeah

2216
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,800
firstly with the full equipment you can

2217
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,239
create different scenarios i would like

2218
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,480
to explain one scenario

2219
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,440
for example gps supporting it is one of

2220
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,199
the well-known attacks or one of the

2221
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,760
well-known vulnerabilities for the gps

2222
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,920
gps is connected to the active

2223
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,719
electronic map and connected to the

2224
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,880
track control system

2225
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,000
for instance during the gps proofing

2226
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
attack track control stand what is that

2227
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,280
it is called like uh autopilot actually

2228
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,199
if you

2229
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:19,730
uh

2230
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:21,040
[Music]

2231
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,520
in case of a gps proofing attack it is

2232
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,199
possible theoretical is my idea only

2233
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,480
a

2234
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,440
misdirect vessel because track control

2235
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,080
system is depends on the actors activist

2236
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,719
depends on the gps and the starting

2237
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,000
initial point is the gps and for this

2238
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,520
reason i think it is possible to

2239
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,920
misdirect to vessel

2240
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,480
you can if you have a full system if you

2241
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,360
have more components

2242
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,080
you can create more scenarios this is

2243
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,040
the one issue

2244
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,400
the another one if you have a system

2245
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,080
yes this is this testbed for cyber

2246
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,679
security

2247
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,400
but if you have a system

2248
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,360
you can also make some research for the

2249
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,040
operational site

2250
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,800
for example

2251
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,199
for the awareness of the seafarers

2252
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,120
because at the end of the day

2253
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,120
for the conventional vessel at least we

2254
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,320
need seafarers and today many people

2255
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,120
mention about that the weakest point is

2256
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,840
the seafarers it is open to discussion

2257
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,639
because also the strongest point from my

2258
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,080
point of view

2259
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,000
because at the sea we need this sea

2260
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,199
first

2261
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,440
uh

2262
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,800
yes is it good for you right perfect

2263
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,280
i will take the question from

2264
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,440
the audience please go ahead

2265
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,320
okay i will actually stand up now um

2266
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,199
thanks

2267
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,639
you're all for your for your

2268
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,120
presentation super interesting uh so for

2269
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,639
me coming from the cyber threat

2270
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,159
intelligence sector

2271
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,280
um

2272
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,600
one question is

2273
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,840
really emerging here so all are

2274
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,080
gathering quite a lot of data

2275
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,280
and especially if you look at the

2276
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,920
maritime sector and if you look at gps

2277
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,800
and ais regarding the messages you mean

2278
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,520
in my massage protocol

2279
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,400
one second one second um

2280
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,120
for example sid was talking about uh

2281
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,600
that they had gathered over a terabyte

2282
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,080
of data in their exercises you're

2283
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,760
speaking about all the tools you're

2284
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,400
working with uh for for monitoring the

2285
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,400
ais the gps and so on

2286
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,880
and i just quickly looked it up again uh

2287
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,440
the ais spoofing is not a new thing

2288
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,400
right so this happened in 2017 to at

2289
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,440
least i think 20 nato vessels so it has

2290
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,960
happened and it has happened in the

2291
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,639
alliance um so from a cti point of sand

2292
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,840
uh stand point of view um could you give

2293
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,080
some examples to

2294
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,880
which tools you use to analyze these

2295
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,000
massive amounts of data and to find like

2296
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,320
some real time and actionable threat

2297
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,320
intelligence uh on the cyber

2298
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,719
vulnerability so which cves have been

2299
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,360
exploited how can you react up on that

2300
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,520
how can you immediately patch and update

2301
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,120
and all of that actually we didn't do

2302
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,600
that however another project

2303
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,800
it was done

2304
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,400
as i remember for example secureas they

2305
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,080
you know as data actually includes

2306
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,120
uh

2307
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,600
three kinds four types of messages

2308
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,000
scientific messages dynamic messages

2309
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,600
word related messages and safety

2310
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,159
messages and

2311
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,800
real time they collect this kind of data

2312
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,679
and compare for example

2313
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,840
if we are

2314
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:44,239
started to get some data from the ais

2315
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,679
regarding the ship type

2316
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,280
however

2317
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,080
the cargo is different than ship type is

2318
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,880
not comprised with the ship type

2319
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,880
it gives an alarm

2320
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,920
we didn't do but it was done in another

2321
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,800
project they compared the aes data with

2322
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,120
another as data

2323
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,639
this is a

2324
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:07,760
option

2325
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,920
actually we had uh

2326
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,880
we published a papers with ahmed is my

2327
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,800
office uh

2328
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,000
friends and

2329
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,320
uh also my close friends

2330
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,679
we checked the nba messages you know any

2331
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,600
messages

2332
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,880
and

2333
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,639
we try to establish the enemy messages

2334
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,800
different fields i mean

2335
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,719
and main messages maybe some people

2336
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,560
doesn't know any messages consist of

2337
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,199
several fields and we compared this

2338
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,199
field with another messages in our

2339
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,120
papers

2340
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,920
for example

2341
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,040
if

2342
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,920
a message regarding the rpm revolution

2343
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,159
per minute

2344
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,800
running

2345
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,280
i mean there is a data for the rpm for

2346
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,920
example

2347
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,639
60 rpm

2348
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,040
instead of these messages

2349
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,600
there is no any movement of the vessel

2350
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,280
we can understand that there is an

2351
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,520
anomaly this anomaly could be relevant

2352
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,920
with the cyber attack or maybe sense or

2353
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,320
failure

2354
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,960
all right

2355
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,600
yeah i will before i and gabor have you

2356
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,199
been introduced does anyone know that

2357
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,679
you are a phd student and you are also

2358
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,560
doing research in naval systems

2359
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,600
gabor my friend you have a question

2360
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,960
yeah

2361
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,120
this is why this spawner is here because

2362
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,080
they are supporting my phd

2363
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,960
estonia is a very open-minded country

2364
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,239
and if i tell my my boss that i do not

2365
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,760
know the answer they usually

2366
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,840
accept this answer

2367
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,159
the last answer

2368
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,320
the last question was that is it

2369
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,840
possible to

2370
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,480
to integrate maritime

2371
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,040
components to our cyber exercise lock

2372
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,960
shirts

2373
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,920
so i transferred the the question to you

2374
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,280
guys either as a digital twin either the

2375
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,440
virtualized test that would it be

2376
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,440
possible

2377
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,520
my bars for sure that's corresponds all

2378
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,719
with the questions that i have could you

2379
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,080
could you tell me again your question

2380
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,199
please

2381
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,560
yeah

2382
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,719
i can respect it uh

2383
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,320
how could we integrate a

2384
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,920
virtual ship or uh digital twin of a

2385
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,080
ship tour exercise do you think that it

2386
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,639
is feasible possible will you do it for

2387
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,719
us

2388
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,639
i uh i i think it is possible and today

2389
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,520
it is trying to

2390
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,840
conduct trying to succeed

2391
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,880
some

2392
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,480
researchers to do that and

2393
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,320
of course there are some difficulties i

2394
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,639
know because

2395
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,440
manufacturers also use the different

2396
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,199
v points different

2397
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,199
protocols there are some difficulties

2398
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,719
and there are some i remember some

2399
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,960
projects i don't want to mention here

2400
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,320
but it was unsuccessful

2401
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:13,759
however if also the manufacturer maybe

2402
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,199
could be open for the discussion

2403
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,199
it could be possibility that's my

2404
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,120
viewpoint all right

2405
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,840
but there's an unsuccessful

2406
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,679
project we may learn sorry for we may

2407
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,679
learn we may learn from the unsuccessful

2408
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,320
project the best things that we learn is

2409
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,840
from our own mistakes even though

2410
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,400
someone told you not to do so

2411
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,560
with this i would like to also wrap up

2412
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,080
quickly the panel so digital twin is

2413
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,639
something we understood is a ambiguous

2414
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,560
term we see that

2415
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,480
joe my friend here is trying to

2416
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,199
replicate an evil dockyard and bringing

2417
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,800
it as a as a model as a virtual model

2418
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,600
said is using a digital shadow uh

2419
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,440
technology where it's interlinked

2420
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,440
already with the physical system with

2421
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,760
the with the one in the virtual space to

2422
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,679
speed up as you would quickly watch a

2423
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:06,239
movie or listen to an audio book which

2424
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,320
is really awesome approach

2425
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,880
and eye bars you're taking already a

2426
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,920
miniature version of hardware that is

2427
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,239
representing a huge vessel right and

2428
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,080
you're trying to play around with it so

2429
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,480
there are different approaches that we

2430
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,880
we can take on this i would like to

2431
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,360
thank each one of you and specifically

2432
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,679
you as the audience for being awake and

2433
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,440
asking questions really engaging

2434
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,280
questions a round of applause for

2435
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,000
everyone thank you
