00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,560
dear cyclone participants dear friends

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,799
i am pleased to open the conference

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,160
which i have heard

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,519
is the event of a year for the

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
cyber security community

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,480
and i would like to thank

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
columnitarian and the nato cooperative

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
cyber defence center of excellence

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,000
for putting together another impressive

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
event

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
the center was founded by six nations in

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
2008.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,558
which was triggered by russian

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,239
cyber attacks on estonia in 2007

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,559
and the realization that another domain

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,760
of warfare

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
was emerging

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
as this year cyclone theme keep moving

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,520
indicates cyber attacks and defensive

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,480
methods

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
strategic thinking about cyber conflicts

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,840
and technology itself have come a long

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
way

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
our dependence on digital solutions in

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
our private lives

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
and in the functioning of our

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
governments and societies

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,840
is such that we can never afford

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
to be complacent about cyber security

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
the cyber security center itself has

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
grown

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
to 32 nations

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
underlining the need

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
for working together

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,640
i would like to highlight the recent

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
invitation to ukraine to join the nato

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
cyber center as mentioned already by a

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
colonitarian

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
it will further link

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,159
ukraine and nato and it will allow for

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
valuable exchange of experience

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
and information

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
i'm very pleased to be able to finally

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
welcome ukraine to a nato cyber center

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
and i think we would all struggle to

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
find a nation that has in recent memory

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,960
fought so easily and bravely

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
both in the cyberspace

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,600
and on a battlefield

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
they are an inspiration to us all

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
to defend its institution critical

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
services and its population ukraine has

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,758
received a lot of help

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,440
from friendly governments

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
and international organizations

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
from industry

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
from private citizens who felt compelled

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,840
to offer their

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,760
support but we all know that even with

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
all help nobody else can defend our i.t

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,879
and communication system

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,519
and ukraine certainly has shown the

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,239
capability in this domain

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
even surprisingly impressing some of us

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
of course

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,160
russia's war in ukraine continues

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
the analysts are still making their

68
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,519
assessments

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,720
however

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,879
we can say that so far

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
russian attackers have been less

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
skillful than expected

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,319
the scale and impact of their attacks

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
has been less significant

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
than we thought it would be

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
this is not a claim that russian

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
activities in the cyber realm have had

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
no serious consequences

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
one only has to point to attacks against

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
satellite provider viacet

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
or some of the biggest ukrainian

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
telecommunication providers

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
like

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
ukraine telecom or geoland

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
both led to critical services being

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
temporarily and available

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
however

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
this did not give a decisive advantage

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
to russian attackers and they didn't

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
manage

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
to permanently destroy or disable

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
critical services not prevent ukrainian

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
government

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,599
from functioning

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,519
but what has been clearly demonstrated

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,319
is that cyber operations are now and

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
will be a significant part of

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
preparations

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
for and in conduct of military

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
operations

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
in ukraine cyber capabilities have been

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
used for example to target critical

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
infrastructure and i.t systems have

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
information and intelligence

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
disrupt communications spread this

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,959
information

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,439
and prevent the public success

108
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
to information

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,798
as revealed by reporting by microsoft in

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,600
april 6 separate russia alliance nation

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,759
state actors launched more than

112
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,120
237 operations against ukraine

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
and that in my eyes and many many cases

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
military operations were supported by

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
hacking

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,400
but i know that

117
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,639
99.9 percent of the people in this room

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
can analyze and assess the situation

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
better than

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
i can

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
so i will not attempt to do your job for

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,199
you

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
i will however

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
share a few conclusions for our strategy

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,320
going forward

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,960
based on recent russian cyber and

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
conventional warfare against ukraine as

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
well as attempts to attack ukraine's

129
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
friends in the west

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
i have three points to offer in this

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
regard

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
first

133
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
offensive cyber operations have become

134
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
an integrate of any serious military

135
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,080
effort

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
cyber and kinetics operations go hand in

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,520
hand and while air strikes and mil

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
artillery can cause large scale physical

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,440
damage

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
cyber is an important enable of those

141
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
activities

142
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
and in shaping

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
the battle space

144
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
as it has been said wars will be fought

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
with both

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
bombs and bytes

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
this means that nato and individual

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,160
allies must continue to work

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,880
on ensuring that the full range of cyber

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
capabilities and activities are

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,080
integrated

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
into our military operations

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
and that defensive and offensive cyber

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
operations are seamlessly integrated in

155
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
our military operations

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
the critical element of any military

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
success depends on all domains

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
supporting each other in the coordinated

159
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,160
way

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
and luckily

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
this is where russian forces have not

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
performed well at all

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
visified nato and allies have an

164
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,880
advantage

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,240
building on hard-won interoperability

166
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,960
from

167
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
exercising and working together in other

168
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
demands for decades

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,479
second

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,240
multinational cooperation and

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
information sharing will be a key by

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
combating cyber threats

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,199
including in case of an armed conflict

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
from nato eu

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,840
and bilaterally european american and

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
other nations have significantly aided

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
ukraine in building up its cyber

178
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
security enterprise

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,759
we have seen that which has made a real

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
difference at a

181
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
time of war

182
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
and as we have seen in ukraine

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
it is not necessarily only the direct

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,560
victim of aggression who has been

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
targeted with hacking

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,199
many nato and eu countries have also

187
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
been affected including estonia most

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
recently we've repeated ddos attacks

189
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
against our government institution

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,919
institutions and organizations

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
plus collateral damage in cyber

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
operation is hard to control

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
so we may all be affected by effects of

194
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
cyber conflict where we are not

195
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,479
directly a party

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
so it makes sense to cooperate and

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
exchange information

198
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,120
such as indications of compromise

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
between governments belonging to a

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,639
western community of values having kun

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
friends in our greatest strengths in

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
this battle

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
and not just between governments but

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
also companies

205
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
and independent experts

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,879
such

207
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,680
cooperation requires unprecedented trust

208
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
but i believe that in this fight we must

209
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
really stick together

210
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
the war is far from over

211
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
and russian cyber attacks against

212
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,800
ukraine and our countries continue

213
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
and may escalate

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
at any moment

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
third

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
the resilience of our government

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,639
societies and the providers of our

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,120
critical services in both

219
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
peace and wartime is critical

220
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,560
as we know cyber threats do not suddenly

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,279
maturize once kinetic operations kick

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
off it is quite the opposite

223
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,559
as the preparations for that are usually

224
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,719
done in cyber demand during peace time

225
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
russia has been carrying out cyber

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
operations against ukraine since 2014

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
and has been busy working towards

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
finding and exploiting new

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
vulnerabilities in ukrainian systems

230
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
ever since

231
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
and russia began preparing for offensive

232
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,920
cyber operations almost a year before

233
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
the tanks rolled over ukraine border on

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
24th of february

235
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
we have seen that russia's offensive

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
strategy in the physical realm as well

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
as cyber battlefield is to target

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
civilians

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
in cybertron which means services that

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
are critical for the society to function

241
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
according to microsoft

242
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
in realm of 40 percent of cyber attacks

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
were directed towards critical services

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
so the boring everyday work work of

245
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
ensuring the resilience of our digital

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,680
services securing our data and adequate

247
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
cyber defense capabilities for our

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
critical services providers

249
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,959
will make a difference

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
ensuring that our citizens know enough

251
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,240
about basic cyber hygiene and aware of

252
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,800
perils that exist in cyberspace

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
is another important strand of work

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,080
ahead of us all

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
all of this is true today

256
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
but most of all in wartime conditions

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
when we will be subjected by

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
cyberattacks

259
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
24 7.

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
estonia may rank highly in international

261
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
rankings for cyber security

262
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,519
but we can and we should do better

263
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
and continue to help countries like

264
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,320
ukraine

265
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,959
as we have done enough our e-government

266
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,360
academy

267
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,880
so i believe that we have our agenda set

268
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
out for us i'm sure

269
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
that our discussions today will take

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,519
forward our collective efforts to ensure

271
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,760
our and our partners security in the

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
cyber realm

273
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,360
finally

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
i truly believe that if you if our help

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
and support to ukraine are steadfast

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
ukraine will secure its freedom

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
democracy

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
and its rightful place

279
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,440
in the european family

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
but we must all pitch in and continue to

281
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
help our ukrainian friends with our

282
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,079
cyber defense expertise information

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,800
and resources

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
thank you i wish you all for provoking

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,460
conference

286
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,589
[Applause]
