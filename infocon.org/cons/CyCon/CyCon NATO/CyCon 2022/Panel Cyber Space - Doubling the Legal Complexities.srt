00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,280
good afternoon i'm patrick o'keefe irish

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
named german accent

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
and i will be the moderator for this

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,639
upcoming session

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,400
i'm thanking anne and the whole team of

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,759
the cycon

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,280
for bringing us all together in this

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
room and i'm really astonished that so

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
many people join us today i welcome you

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
to the breakout session cyberspace

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,439
doubling the legal complexities

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
it's no news when i say cyber security

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
is not limited to the traditional

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,199
domains land air sea where i originate

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
from

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
however with growing military as well as

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,520
growing commercial activities in space

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
safe and secure operations

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
in a multi-domain environment yes that's

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
another key and buzzword that is coming

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
up in the nato umbrella are more

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,039
important than ever

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,600
however cyber security in space has not

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
has not

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
yet found its place in a comprehensive

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,879
security architecture

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
as it should really happy to see as well

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760
space governance and space law in

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
particular

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
offers way to mitigate the risk

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
surprisingly it does

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
together with the team of psychon we

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
assembled a team of experts

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
to help us to understand the current

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
situation and the challenges in

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,640
governance and security in outer space

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,960
and possible solutions to keep us moving

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
forward

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
stronger than ever before

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
i have to say as a former navy a naval

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
aviator who eventually ended up

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
switching the cockpit to a desk for

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
space policy

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,479
i was afraid that this area might be a

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
little bit more theoretically

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
but i can only reiterate and reassure to

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
say quite the opposite

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,799
it's more

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
it's more actionable and it's more

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
realistic on a daily basis than you can

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
might imagine

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
in the next

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
85 minutes

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,360
under the guidance of three experts we

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
are going to leave this room we are

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
going to space and come back

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
and i think not even elon musk is able

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,640
to offer that service to us today

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
so we are going to have three

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
presentations about 15 to 20 minutes

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
each to give us enough room to maneuver

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
afterwards for a intensive q a session

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
and i really would like to ask you to

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,879
prepare all your questions

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,640
to use the time

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
afterwards and challenge all three

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,640
experts at the end of the breakout

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
session

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,000
i'm handing over to the speakers and ask

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
each of you

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
seth julia and leticia to also briefly

72
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
introduce yourself and to take us into

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
space seth you have the floor thank you

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,359
all right good afternoon

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,519
this is an exciting topic and i fully

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
recognize that this is a this is a cyber

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,879
conference

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,920
um

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,879
forgive my excitement a little bit i i

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,480
have worked as a space lawyer for the

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
last several years um for the united

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
states air force

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,080
and some of its joint commands

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
as such i

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
hope you'll also forgive my disclaimer

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
here these are my opinions and the

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
opinions of my co-author

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
um dan osborne who's who's with us today

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
uh not necessarily those of the

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,239
department of defense united states air

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
force united states space force or any

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,080
of the other organizations within the

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
dod

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
that said

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
multi-domain operations

96
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,959
is

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,920
is

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,239
a real current construct in a real way

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
that we need to be thinking of things

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
general narcissoni's remarks this

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
morning were very on point when he was

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
describing

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,840
um

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
different operations and how

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,519
how important an integral

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,959
cyber is in in not just modern conflict

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
but the continuum of conflict like you

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
talked about

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
space likewise

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
overlaps with cyber in so many aspects

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,159
we don't control satellites we don't

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
conduct satellite activities without

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
having cyber activities as well

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,360
along with all the propulsion and the

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
astrophysics and all the orbital

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
mechanics that go with

117
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
satellite maneuvers and things like that

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
so what i want to talk about kind of

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
with that with that framework i'm going

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
to talk about a couple of provisions of

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
the outer space treaty

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,400
um

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
that we found really interesting and

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
have have a bridge

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
to some of the the construct and the

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
legal construct of of cyber

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,759
um bridging a lot of the the regulatory

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
framework into space as well

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,120
the two provisions

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
are

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
the the

132
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
article 6 and article 7 in the outer

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,479
space treaty

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
article 6 talks about responsibility

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
article 7 talks about liability i'll

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
give kind of a a quick recap

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
a little a little nuance with the

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
responsibility provision and then i want

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
to give some examples as to how cyber

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
intervening acts affect both the

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,919
responsibility and liability provisions

142
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
now i should caveat as we talk about

143
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,800
responsibility and liability provisions

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
i'm talking about the outer space treaty

145
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
which also includes a reference to

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
incorporation of international law

147
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
including the un charter

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
in in

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,240
in activities in space i'm not talking

150
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
about use of force and armed attack but

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
leticia is in a few moments

152
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
and we're happy to answer questions

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
about use of force in armed attack but

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
for for the sake of of this argument in

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
this conversation

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
about

157
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
responsibility and liability i'll focus

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
on on mostly areas outside of conflict

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
responsibility has has two aspects to it

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
first

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
states have a responsibility

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,479
to

163
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,440
govern to legislate conduct some kind of

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,080
regulatory framework for its outer space

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
activities and the word in the in the

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
treaty is national activities in outer

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
space

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
and

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
if you if you look up or google a

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
definition for it

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
it's hard to find

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
of course it's not written in the treaty

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
just like many other treaty provisions

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
we look to

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
things like the vienna convention on the

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,400
law of treaties to try and determine

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
what ambiguous terms are which means

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
look for other treaties look to state

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
practice

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
and

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
as we look to other treaties in state

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
practice we see we see um and even

183
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
statements by other organizations

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
including the un we see that the

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
national activities in outer space

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
consist of things like that that are

187
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
fairly obvious right so launches

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
states are going to regulatory launches

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
into outer space and i think that that

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
makes

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
sense satellite maneuvers another one

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
that makes sense we're also we also

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
found um uh the un in particular and a

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
whole myriad of of space-faring states

195
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
have regulated satellite communications

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
and

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
remote sensing

198
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
all four of these we can safely say

199
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
are national activities in outer space

200
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
there are probably some others and

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
there's an interesting conversation to

202
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,800
be had uh maybe on the break or or maybe

203
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
during our q a about

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,039
commercialization of space and what

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,840
national activities look like with the

206
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,039
commercialization of space but this

207
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,280
construct is a little unique to space

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,039
where we have states

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
that have a treaty-bound responsibility

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,880
to govern certain activities and so

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
that's what what responsibility is one

212
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
of our arguments in this is that just

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
the same way that space response space

214
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
activities

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,160
are governed there are cyber

216
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
responsibilities that do those four

217
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,280
things

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
that can also that should also be

219
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
regulated and states should regulate

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
those things launches are a little bit

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
tricky right you can't you can't

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
at least right now we haven't seen any

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
launches purely uh done by by hacking

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
into a system but remote sensing

225
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
satellite communications satellite

226
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
maneuvers can

227
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,440
uh

228
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
theoretically be done

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,720
by uh by cyber means by an intervening

230
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
actor

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
all of those things if they can be

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
if they are required to be regulated

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
outside of of

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
um

235
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,320
cyber means and without an intervening

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
actor then they should be regulated as

237
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
well

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,159
without that

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,000
the second point i want to make with

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519
responsibility

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,800
is

242
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
there's a financial aspect to this and

243
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
we haven't seen this playing out with

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
states yet but we have seen a lot of

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,279
academic

246
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,680
discussions about hey there are

247
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,720
instances when this liability provision

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
doesn't apply

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
but responsibility can for example

250
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
if

251
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
um

252
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
a state launches a satellite they are

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
the liable satellite under the

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
the liability convention and the

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
liability provision that we'll talk

256
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
about a little more deeper in a sec

257
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,160
however if that satellite if that

258
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
country sells that satellite to a second

259
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
country the second country is now the

260
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
responsible country they are responsible

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
under under the terms of this treaty

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,399
which means if it crashes into another

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
satellite it can then

264
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
be held liable it's the responsible

265
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
state that's held liable

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
now

267
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
shifting a little bit and incorporating

268
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
the liability provision

269
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
the liability provision of the treaty

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
also uh binds the this the launching

271
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
state to be liable for

272
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,080
uh

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
for for any damage now

274
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
i won't get too deep this isn't a

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
liability full liability conversation is

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
a little bit um on orbit is fault

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
liability under the treaty

278
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
so think kind of kind of negligence in

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
in some of your common law states and

280
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
how that might work and then um

281
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,480
terrestrial damage is absolute liability

282
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
we've never really seen this play out

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
we've seen it invoked a couple of times

284
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
just just loosely but not in a way that

285
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,440
uh

286
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
fully triggered the enforcement

287
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
mechanisms and and convene the boards

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
that

289
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
oversee this stuff

290
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,880
um

291
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
now some of you are probably thinking

292
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
this is all well and good

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,079
or maybe some of you are thinking this

294
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,680
is way deeper

295
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
into law than i expected and i should

296
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
have gone to another room

297
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,120
but

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
um

299
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
um

300
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
where does cyber come in well here it is

301
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
so you've got the same scenario right so

302
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
you've got state a that launches a

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
satellite they are the liable satellite

304
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
or the liable country under the

305
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
liability provisions okay

306
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
state a then sells it to state b we'll

307
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
call it the buying state b b is in bravo

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
the buying state right so state b now

309
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
owns this satellite they didn't have to

310
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
launch it it's on orbit already they can

311
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
do whatever they would like with under

312
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,000
the provisions of their um of their

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
government regulations which includes

314
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
you know maybe taking pictures of the

315
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800
earth maybe um

316
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
satellite communications whatever

317
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
whatever that satellite is set up to do

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
and their their country allows for them

319
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
to do

320
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
and then

321
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
uh we've got a cyber actor

322
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
and yes we'll call it country c

323
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
is a cyber actor

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
so country c intervenes and they

325
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,399
crash this satellite into

326
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,519
a different satellite

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
now

328
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
somebody might be thinking if only there

329
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
was a slide that depicted all of this

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
stuff

331
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
my friends i'm here to help you

332
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,639
okay

333
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,839
country a is the launching state again

334
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,440
country

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
b

336
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
is the buying state they purchased the

337
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,000
satellite it's already on orbit country

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
c conducts this

339
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
classy cyber maneuver

340
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,880
um

341
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
is intervening act

342
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,680
and this intervening act can be

343
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
um a maneuver we'll consider it a

344
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
maneuver in this instance and then

345
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,880
it crashes into

346
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,839
d causing debris

347
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,399
um crashes into i should say on orbit a

348
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
satellite owned by country d

349
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
okay so cash

350
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
causing debris

351
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,839
um

352
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,800
in

353
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
normal terms we would consider this

354
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
liability without the cyber actor we

355
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
would say country a is liable

356
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,959
and

357
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
that's a little bit of a liability

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
loophole right country a now has nothing

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
to do with the satellite but they are

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
liable and can recoup damages from

361
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,279
country b

362
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,480
or

363
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,560
or through other diplomatic channels

364
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
that said

365
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
country b

366
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,240
is now the responsible actor

367
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
so they have the responsibility

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
including the financial responsibility

369
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
that we discussed

370
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
and um

371
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,880
but it's fault liability on orbit so

372
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
what can they do

373
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,079
they can claim

374
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,959
that

375
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
uh we have this intervening act

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
no attribution needed

377
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
they just need to determine that it's an

378
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
intervening act and then they are not

379
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
at fault or at least maybe partly at

380
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
fault so if we think of of comparative

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
uh negligence and some some common law

382
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,040
states have this this aspect of maybe

383
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
you're only liable up to a certain

384
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
extent and maybe another country is

385
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,240
liable up to

386
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
a greater extent that other country may

387
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
need to be identified if they're going

388
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,160
to recoup damages from that other

389
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
country but

390
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
as far as b is concerned b only needs to

391
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,120
identify that there was a cyber actor to

392
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,639
um

393
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,120
to deflect some of the liability that

394
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,399
falls under the responsibility

395
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,839
provisions

396
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
so where does that leave us

397
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
well that leaves us with a a couple of a

398
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
couple of takeaways

399
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,079
given

400
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,959
the

401
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
the responsibility and liability

402
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
provisions

403
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
first it leaves us with with

404
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,120
we need to account for

405
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
for this cyber intervening acts that can

406
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
that can affect liability or it can

407
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
affect responsibility

408
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
because we should say too

409
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
if this crash happens terrestrial on

410
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
earth

411
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
then attribution matters because then

412
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
it's absolute liability not fault

413
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,440
liability and so they're going to have

414
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
to deflect

415
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,399
in order to deflect liability that they

416
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,839
have to they have to be able to

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
attribute to another state that gets a

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
little tricky right and so attribution

419
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
becomes a real limitation

420
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
another limitation

421
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
is that we haven't seen states practice

422
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
like this

423
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
we have seen states

424
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
use diplomatic means to determine

425
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
um

426
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
to determine

427
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
how much they owe each other and that's

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,800
the same in space and with other

429
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,079
contexts

430
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
so

431
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
several years ago there was

432
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,839
russia and canada had a dispute where

433
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
canada

434
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
had a russian space object that affected

435
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,199
they impacted

436
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,920
the canadian territory and i i i

437
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
not too much into the without going too

438
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,639
much into the details um the dispute was

439
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,480
essentially settled before they can

440
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
invoke all of the liability provisions

441
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,639
of the the liability convention

442
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
that left them settling it

443
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
diplomatically

444
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,320
other situations where where there's

445
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
been damage on orbit

446
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
settled diplomatically or ignored so

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
that leaves us with again

448
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,360
looking at looking at state practice

449
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
states have chosen to settle these

450
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
things diplomatically this gives us a

451
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
construct to settle it diplomatically

452
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
and uh i would assert that we should we

453
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
should

454
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
be conscious

455
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
of

456
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
of how cyber affects both of these

457
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
provisions and invoke these provisions

458
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
and not be afraid to to say hey this is

459
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
uh this has never been done like this

460
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
before but diplomatic means have been

461
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
used before and this is a diplomatic way

462
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
to do this

463
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,120
the second takeaway that um that i'll

464
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
leave you with and we'll sum up here at

465
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,759
the end

466
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
is that

467
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,480
under the responsibility

468
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,399
provision states must have regulations

469
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
to govern cyber acts and i'll give

470
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,599
another example

471
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
and i'll use the the

472
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
u.s as an example so if there's a

473
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,400
there's an individual

474
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,839
in the u.s

475
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,199
that is

476
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,160
um

477
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
affecting a satellite

478
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,959
right so if we go back to uh

479
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,359
the cyber means the cyber activity

480
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,799
that's affecting

481
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,160
satellite b

482
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
and this cyber activity is originating

483
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,359
in the us

484
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
this cyber activity is a national

485
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,039
activity in outer space

486
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
it has not been applied that way at

487
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,919
least certainly in 19 in the 1960s when

488
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,760
the soviet union and the u.s and other

489
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,120
space fairing nations were trying to

490
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
come up with the outer space treaty they

491
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
weren't considering ones and zeros in

492
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,320
the same way that we consider ones and

493
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
zeros and they certainly weren't

494
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
considering

495
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,039
certain methods and satellite

496
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
communications and remote sensing and

497
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
all of these things that can be

498
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
conducted through cyber means and

499
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
certainly not through an intervening

500
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
cyber actor or a hacker but if that

501
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
individual

502
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
can hack

503
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,240
into a satellite and conduct a

504
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
cyberactivity that either moves the

505
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
satellite or conducts one of those those

506
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
activities it is a national activity in

507
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
outer space and should be um

508
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
governed by

509
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
the outer space

510
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
uh the outer space treaty at least

511
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
says that the states should have a

512
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
regulatory framework for it just as it

513
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
has regulatory framework for other for

514
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
other means

515
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
um

516
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
so again two takeaways one is that we

517
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
need to consider cyber is an intervening

518
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,720
actor and two

519
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
uh states need to govern that and with

520
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
that i'll hand it over to julia

521
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,000
to discuss our our next section thanks

522
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
thank you yeah thanks

523
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
okay

524
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
good morning to everyone and thank you

525
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
for the invitation

526
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,000
i was

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
asked actually to discuss the

528
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
possible implications for nato

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,919
in the recognition of outer space as an

530
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
operational domain

531
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
which is a very hard work

532
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
and of course i will focus only on some

533
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
of the implications

534
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,559
plus

535
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,200
together with all the implications what

536
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
could be the element of further

537
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
complexity determined by

538
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,559
reversible operations and here i focus

539
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,559
on the concept of reversible operations

540
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
rather than cyber itself because space

541
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
infrastructures

542
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
can actually be target for

543
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
a big spectrum of operations that just

544
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,120
go to temporarily incapacitate the

545
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
target

546
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
not limited to cyber

547
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
operations against space infrastructure

548
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,840
nato was not new to the space domain of

549
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,480
course the alliance recognized already

550
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
space as a global common in 2011 and

551
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,679
then in 2009 and 2016 but it was only in

552
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
2018 that its member states began to

553
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
consider reading space as um as both an

554
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
enabler for uh for

555
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
its military operations with the

556
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
brussels summit uh but also

557
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
um recognized that action was needed and

558
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
at least to to define some objectives

559
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
when approaching space

560
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,919
with the now unclassified nato space

561
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,039
policy

562
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,919
adopted in 2019

563
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,320
in contrast to some member states of of

564
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
the alliance that expressly qualified

565
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,720
outer spaces that were fighting domain

566
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,440
the

567
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
alliance preferred it to qualify it as

568
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,559
an operational domain and this actually

569
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
can have some implication on its role as

570
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,360
more as an integrator and coordinator

571
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
among member states to approach to

572
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,559
reversible operation

573
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
right now the member states of the

574
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,080
alliance are and the alliance itself are

575
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
facing a new set of threats in fact

576
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
compared to

577
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
uh the beginning of the space age we had

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
a shift from irreversible aesthetic

579
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,240
kinetic aesate which were really meant

580
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
to destroy the target and which now are

581
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,799
mainly perceived despite the fact that

582
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,120
they were conducted recently by russia

583
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
and jenson they are mainly conceived as

584
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
projection of power but rather

585
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,159
a lot of most of the spacefaring

586
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,280
countries are now reverting to

587
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,200
operations also for a neoliberalist

588
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
approach because basically it's

589
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,320
acknowledged right now that if i go to

590
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
destroy the target this will be

591
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
this we produce debris

592
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
and so we can say that now there's a new

593
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,840
neoliberalist approach that really

594
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,640
perceives counter space only in terms of

595
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,799
incapacitation rather than destruction

596
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,360
of the target

597
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
this brings us down to two

598
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,679
considerations where nato could actually

599
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,799
have a significant role the first one is

600
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
that we should start to align to some of

601
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
the technical doctrine and this

602
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
position was it has not been yet

603
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
exported for instance in the space law

604
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,480
discussion that some space

605
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
infrastructure should be

606
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
perceived as critical space

607
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
infrastructure

608
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
we have to

609
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
do this step

610
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,400
not only because

611
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
space infrastructures are not

612
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
self-sustaining infrastructures and are

613
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
deeply cyber dependent among others but

614
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
also because they don't experience

615
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,600
medium thresholds when i go to

616
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
incapacitate even temporarily and even

617
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,520
if it's reversible the the space asset

618
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
then its consequences on the related

619
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,039
infrastructures both in space and on the

620
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,080
ground

621
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,039
can still be irreversible

622
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,840
the um here

623
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,159
the role of nato and this is recognized

624
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
in the space policy could be to

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,760
coordinate the process in the

626
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,240
identification and then designation of

627
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,080
critical infrastructures which right now

628
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,039
is only a national approach

629
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,159
in its uh in its space policy

630
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
the alliance recognized that nato should

631
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
develop a common understanding of

632
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
concepts nato will consider ways to

633
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,120
improve space resilience alliance wide

634
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,840
including through sharing of best

635
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,360
practices and guidelines will need to be

636
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
developed on how to secure and ensure

637
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
nato's access to space data products

638
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
services and capabilities so from the

639
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
document it is very clear that nato

640
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
depends on its member state space based

641
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,799
assets

642
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
but also

643
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
that nato can have a role in the

644
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
designation of these infrastructures and

645
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,360
this is my first um takeaway

646
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
um

647
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,279
the second take and and if you want then

648
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,760
i can explain which means it could be

649
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
used um

650
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
within the the nato framework

651
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,520
um the second takeaway then relates

652
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
to

653
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
the how

654
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,760
because when we say that critical

655
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,919
infraspace infrastructures must be

656
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,640
protected then we have to be able to

657
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,799
assess the type of threats that the

658
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,640
different

659
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
objects

660
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
will face and there is where again the

661
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,919
alliance took already quite a

662
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,840
strong stance

663
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
[Music]

664
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
setting among its subjective space

665
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,320
domain awareness space domain awareness

666
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,400
is a very specific concept that goes

667
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
beyond what was initially its precursor

668
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
which was a space situational awareness

669
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
mainly related to a benign environment

670
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
and it goes a layer further because it

671
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,520
really through a set of other

672
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
skills and other

673
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
information

674
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
related also to intelligence gathering

675
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
and so on go to establish the intention

676
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,799
behind

677
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,600
the the behavior and the spacing or the

678
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
threat in the space environment

679
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,880
but sda therefore is strictly linked to

680
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
the ability and to the readiness of the

681
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,480
alliance forces to

682
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,039
react to space threats

683
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
but it has also

684
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,279
a very technical component which is in

685
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
the end ssa

686
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,679
ssa right now

687
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,799
it's

688
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,919
it's not implemented uniformly at

689
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,080
at the international level and there

690
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,000
isn't any

691
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,880
obligation that imposed under even space

692
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,760
law that imposed to states to share ssa

693
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
information and this is quite a huge gap

694
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,799
in fact in the outer space treaty we

695
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,840
have

696
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
of course we can leverage a very weak

697
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
obligation on article 1 and on article 9

698
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
article 1 as it relates to the freedom

699
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
and then of of exploration and use of

700
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
outer space and then it connects to the

701
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,440
information mechanism through article 9

702
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,240
but we can also leverage some duty to

703
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,120
share information on articles 10 and 11

704
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,919
which really provides us with

705
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,480
the means to share this information but

706
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
then when we go to operationalize these

707
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,760
concepts and apply them concretely

708
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,159
the vagueness of the treaty

709
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
becomes a problem the treaty refers to

710
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,200
clauses such as to the greatest extent

711
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
feasible and practical so it doesn't

712
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
give any inch on when this should happen

713
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
or as soon as practical so um

714
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,919
if we then

715
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,000
transfer this

716
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
this issue within nato

717
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
it becomes even more complicated because

718
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,679
first of all states can only decide

719
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,000
whether they want or not to share ssa

720
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,320
data so space domain awareness which

721
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,600
really is based on ssa can be severely

722
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
jeopardized and could only become a

723
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
political

724
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,679
objective rather than a concrete one

725
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
and the other issue is that right now

726
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,240
there is as i was mentioned before ssa

727
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
is approached

728
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,320
from a domestic or regional level

729
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,200
domestic level means that um

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,159
even the biggest states that own and and

731
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,799
right now have ssa sharing

732
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,640
programs such as the us

733
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
can still decide and they decided to

734
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
impose some limitations of course in the

735
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
distribution of data or then in the

736
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
transfer of such data to third party

737
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
these even with

738
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,840
states that are already

739
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,480
gathered into regional frameworks this

740
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,200
happens for instance with the eu

741
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,480
the eu shares ssa data with the u.s and

742
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,440
vice versa but then when we go to see

743
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
how this is done this is done through a

744
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
net of bilateral agreements with a lot

745
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
of course of then limitation on the

746
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,919
transfer of third parties even within

747
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
the same union

748
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,640
and the other issue then

749
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
relates to

750
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,960
the integration of different sources of

751
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,320
ssa data

752
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,039
if as we are experiencing and it's

753
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,279
expected with the new space

754
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
advent we will integrate more and more

755
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,799
commercial products into ssa services

756
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,240
and practices

757
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
these in the end

758
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
will

759
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240
affect also the nato

760
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,720
security why because there's not a

761
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
standardization process yet we don't

762
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
have international standards agreed

763
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
there and so it's very difficult even to

764
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
um ensure for instance that there is a

765
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,399
cyber security by design that is shared

766
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,880
by all the partners so this could be one

767
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,760
of the

768
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,960
of the

769
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
first critical issues with space domain

770
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
awareness the second issue is that of

771
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
course nato doesn't own capabilities but

772
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,720
as mentioned before rely on the services

773
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
uh of its of its

774
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
member states and the lies and this is

775
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
happens through memorandum of memorandum

776
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
of understanding and there the problem

777
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,760
could in the end

778
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,360
be that it will not have a say on any of

779
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,039
the practices that will be established

780
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,640
within nato

781
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,600
the other issue is that if

782
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,799
nato wants to perform sda this means

783
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
that there must be a center that

784
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
provides such data and right now of

785
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,600
course

786
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,960
nato lacks of any 24 7 operational cells

787
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
that monitor and then share this

788
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,240
information

789
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,559
but here is also where there is a

790
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,520
possibility for nato to have a role in

791
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,000
sda rather than

792
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,399
pursue sda as

793
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,960
an operational objective this should

794
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,279
really be perceived as a

795
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
political objective meaning that nato

796
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,640
can be a coordinator it can foster

797
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,720
joint states coalition as it happened

798
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
for instance with irs to

799
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
to

800
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,640
to promote and to agree on common

801
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,399
practices

802
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,039
nato can also foster interoperability

803
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,200
because one of the other biggest issue

804
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
of ssa is the interoperability among the

805
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
different systems and there are nato

806
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,320
which has already experienced in

807
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,840
interoperability issues both in the

808
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
sea awareness domain and the in the air

809
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
awareness domain it can certainly um

810
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,919
intervene

811
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,640
and then we go at the form how can nato

812
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,200
do that

813
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,679
my argument is that we shouldn't go with

814
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,679
standard with standards any type of

815
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
standards and especially in space

816
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,440
because

817
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
if we look at just the standardization

818
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
process in space

819
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
in space missions and space program

820
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
standardization takes really a lot of

821
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,880
years even to to happen and for

822
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
standards to be developed so it's not

823
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
dynamic and it can't respond fastly to

824
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
to to

825
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
to changing reversible um

826
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
threats

827
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,240
what uh it's at least in the first phase

828
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
could be advisable is through the the

829
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,880
uh center of excellence and now to the

830
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,399
like now the space center and then the

831
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,080
center of excellence could be to um push

832
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
and and

833
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
coordinates

834
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
states in adopting best practices for

835
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,320
the moment and in sharing best practices

836
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,799
this will be of course favored by the

837
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,760
fact that of course it's a

838
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,840
secure environment where to share such

839
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,760
information which is not the case for

840
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,679
instance at the eu level the you at the

841
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,320
u level now the eu is facing a huge

842
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,240
problem of

843
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,200
trust building and and

844
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
agree on standards in terms of

845
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,399
interoperability

846
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,840
because member states are against or are

847
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,919
against a reluctant at least

848
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,760
to share some

849
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
intelligence practices and some

850
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,640
information at the eu level but this is

851
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
a problem that nato doesn't have and

852
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,919
here is also where nato has an

853
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,240
opportunity actually to intervene and

854
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
for the nato space policy and then

855
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,080
doctrine to to intervene thank you

856
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
thank you

857
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,200
afterwards we all

858
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,519
switch thank you very much uh thank you

859
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,720
very much for

860
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
the organization uh anne and the cc

861
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,039
dcoe

862
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,039
thank you patrick for inviting me to

863
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,440
speak at this panel discussion

864
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
and i before i start i must say that i'm

865
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,799
speaking in my personal capacity

866
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,279
all the views expressed are my own they

867
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
may be yours at some point but

868
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,279
i hope that

869
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,159
this

870
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,760
is clear that i don't represent any

871
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,360
organization or institution whatsoever

872
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
so

873
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,679
at the multilateral level in other words

874
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,720
at the united nations level discussions

875
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,279
on the prevention of an arms race in

876
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,360
outer space

877
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,960
they started

878
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,799
in the 70s at the end of the 70s and the

879
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,120
states decided that it would be

880
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,799
interesting to add an a a gender item at

881
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
the conference on disarmament on paris

882
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,880
preventing enough race in outer space

883
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
since then

884
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
states worked on different aspects of

885
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
this very point because the main treaty

886
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,679
addressing these questions

887
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,480
of space security was the outer space

888
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,200
treaty of 1967

889
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
and as seth

890
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,559
rightly said

891
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
they didn't consider one and zeros the

892
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,440
same way that we are doing it today they

893
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,039
just considered

894
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,600
the prohibition of weapons of mass

895
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,480
destruction and nuclear weapons

896
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,720
or they just consider

897
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
the use of the orbit for peaceful

898
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,799
purposes

899
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
this is still in 2022 this notion of

900
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
peaceful purposes to be interpreted

901
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
so for the past 55 years

902
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
the only political and legal safeguards

903
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,320
of outer space

904
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
has been this provision article 4 of the

905
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
outer space treaty

906
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,480
and otherwise and it worked somehow

907
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,119
diplomacy and all the discussions that

908
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,399
are

909
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,520
being

910
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,399
held

911
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
at the conference on disarmament in

912
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,839
geneva and some discussions also in

913
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
vienna at the committee on the peaceful

914
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,199
uses of outer space

915
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
so

916
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,960
now

917
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
i will state the obvious

918
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,599
the number of cyber activities is

919
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,800
growing

920
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
the degree of reliance of military

921
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,040
forces but also of governmental

922
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
capacities

923
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,399
and the number of important economical

924
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,359
actors on space systems

925
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,839
is growing as well

926
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,599
and the embodiment

927
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,040
of the cyberspace in space assets

928
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
whether they are

929
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
in outer space or underground

930
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,680
must be addressed at the united nations

931
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,640
level

932
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,119
and also at bilateral level between

933
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,800
states

934
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,599
so

935
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,760
what does exist at the international

936
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
level to offer a legal protection to

937
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,640
space operators

938
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,720
earlier today joanna weaver already

939
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,200
addressed that international law

940
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
applies to the cyberspace there are

941
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,200
discussions about the application of

942
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
international humanitarian law this is

943
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,720
also discussions that are occurring at

944
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,480
the un level

945
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,560
article 3 of the outer space treaties

946
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,359
says that international law applies to

947
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,000
outer space including the charter of the

948
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
united nations i will come back to this

949
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,480
a bit later

950
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,040
at the moment especially between the 9th

951
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,359
and the 13th of may so a few weeks ago

952
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
there were some discussions in geneva at

953
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
the conference on disarmament in the

954
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,280
framework of open-ended working group

955
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,599
on the applicability of international

956
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,720
humanitarian law on space activities and

957
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,680
this is a very interesting perspective

958
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,560
because different states have obviously

959
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,880
different views

960
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
so

961
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
i asked the question again what does

962
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,079
exist at the international level to

963
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,760
offer a legal protection to space

964
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,720
operators whether they are military or

965
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
industrial or governmental

966
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,640
not so much

967
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
the liability convention may be

968
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,839
mentioned it was brilliantly said by my

969
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,119
colleague

970
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,079
it applies to the damage it applies to

971
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,320
launching states

972
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
there are some mechanisms that can be

973
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
put in place uh my colleague also

974
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,079
mentioned the possibility to have some

975
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,960
mechanisms maybe not standards maybe

976
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
other mechanisms but this is a

977
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
discussion that must be held between

978
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,640
the different actors

979
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
and my part will be on international law

980
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
what exists at the moment

981
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
so the rules relating to the use of

982
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
force as providing by the united charter

983
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,280
of the united nations could be of value

984
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
when assessing threats emerging

985
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,280
against space activities

986
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
we are talking here about a general

987
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,480
prohibition of the use of force or

988
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
threats

989
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,640
of user force so the question is

990
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,320
what qualify as user false

991
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
so i'm asking the question now so you

992
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
don't ask it to me because you know it's

993
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
not up to me to have an answer but i can

994
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
try to um put together a spectrum of

995
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,079
criteria that can be used

996
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,960
if states decide uh to

997
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,520
go out from the gray zone

998
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,119
so can a cyber activity causing harmful

999
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,640
consequences

1000
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
physical consequences

1001
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,280
be considered as user force

1002
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,160
and when does it amount to an armed

1003
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,560
attack

1004
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,000
i will be very cautious also not to

1005
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,960
mention

1006
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,320
cyber attack

1007
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,800
i will talk about cyber activities

1008
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
because it's the same

1009
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,160
we lawyer we like to define we like to

1010
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
be sure that we are in a you know this

1011
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,280
uh little square of definition

1012
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
i don't have a definition for you about

1013
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,079
love what constitutes a cyber attack

1014
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,440
so here i will focus of on what could be

1015
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,960
the threshold

1016
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,280
triggering the qualification of user

1017
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,160
force

1018
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,960
and it's an important discussion to have

1019
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,359
because cyber activities they are not

1020
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,480
new anymore they are very much a part of

1021
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,280
our world both on the ground and in

1022
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,400
outer space

1023
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,359
and this is why these decisions must be

1024
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,760
taken by the different governments when

1025
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
they agree

1026
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,079
on

1027
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,480
how to react because when you qualify

1028
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,839
user force

1029
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,119
you also

1030
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,160
quite qualify what could elicit a

1031
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,760
response

1032
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,280
and eventually a countermeasure and i

1033
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
invite you to have

1034
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,200
a look and to read the

1035
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,480
last

1036
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
publication of michael schmidt

1037
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
on the different replies to a cyber

1038
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,040
attack it's very interesting and i would

1039
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
be very happy to discuss some of the

1040
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
points with you and i'm sure i've seen

1041
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,200
him uh somewhere that he will be very

1042
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,839
happy to to discuss

1043
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,119
i was sorry i was distracted yes that

1044
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,880
you will be very happy to to discuss it

1045
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
as well so

1046
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,160
when trying to adapt

1047
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,800
international legal instruments policy

1048
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,440
makers are perplexed by technological

1049
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
innovation

1050
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
but it cannot be the case anymore and

1051
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
this is one of my points so what

1052
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,680
criteria should be should we consider

1053
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,920
in international law the international

1054
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
court of justice

1055
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,480
decided that to classify an operation as

1056
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,520
armed attack lawmakers must take into

1057
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,280
account its skills and effect

1058
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,640
the standard of evaluation could be any

1059
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,839
use of force that injures or kill

1060
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,079
persons or damage or destroy property

1061
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,000
so maybe you have at the top of your

1062
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,560
head some

1063
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
cyber activities that occurred in the

1064
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
past

1065
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
i can

1066
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,280
cite i don't know against space systems

1067
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,359
the viasat

1068
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,280
issue that occurred on the 24th of

1069
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
february i can mention the most recent

1070
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,200
starlink

1071
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,520
bridge that occurred but that was quiet

1072
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,720
not easily but at least quickly

1073
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,839
addressed i would say so

1074
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,520
for some experts you know

1075
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,599
what

1076
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,160
the standard of evaluation could be any

1077
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
use of force that injures or kill

1078
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
persons or damage or destroy property

1079
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,359
and this is important for me to repeat

1080
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,160
this

1081
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
because what about cyber theft what

1082
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,880
about operation of intelligence

1083
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,599
gathering or temporary interrupting

1084
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,720
non-essential cyber services

1085
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
can it

1086
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,720
trigger the qualification of user force

1087
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,079
question mark

1088
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
this is also up to states uh to decide

1089
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,040
but for instance few years ago

1090
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,040
the ministry of the armies of france

1091
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,240
publicly stated that there was an issue

1092
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,880
with one of the satellites

1093
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
hotel

1094
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,760
and a very close approach

1095
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,200
no damage

1096
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,119
no issue or

1097
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,040
intelligence catholic

1098
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,560
big issue

1099
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,079
this is exactly the type of

1100
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,240
consideration we must take into

1101
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,800
consideration where qualifying

1102
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
and for some experts if they target

1103
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,520
state's critical infrastructure the the

1104
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,079
threshold is reached as well and my

1105
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,480
colleague mentioned the issue with

1106
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,400
critical infrastructure this is a you

1107
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,640
know individual states decision

1108
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
this is also something that could be

1109
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
triggering and this is something that

1110
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,280
must be you know decides

1111
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,920
so now with regards to cyber activities

1112
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,079
related to space assets

1113
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,560
states are very much aware of what their

1114
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,359
critical infrastructure are

1115
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,079
of course there must be a list somewhere

1116
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,839
of the different critical infrastructure

1117
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,400
place in outer space or on the you know

1118
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,960
like different ground systems and what

1119
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
could be

1120
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,160
protected by all means

1121
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,280
but

1122
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,680
we must take into consideration

1123
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,839
commercial actors as well

1124
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,240
i will come back to this a bit later but

1125
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,200
you know

1126
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,839
what a critical infrastructure is is

1127
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,599
very important because this is how we

1128
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,480
measure easily the gravity of the effect

1129
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,040
in other terms the consequences of cyber

1130
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,319
activities

1131
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,720
even though they are less apparent or

1132
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,960
visible than those resulting from

1133
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
kinetic attacks

1134
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
i mentioned the open-ended working group

1135
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,000
that took place

1136
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,960
in may

1137
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,079
so

1138
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,640
there were different approaches

1139
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
that were taken by states of course

1140
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
there is the approach by nature that is

1141
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,720
quite criticized because there is no

1142
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,680
definition of what a weapon is there is

1143
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,119
no way to verify exactly right now what

1144
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,280
is happening in outer space

1145
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
there is an approach based on the

1146
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,480
behavior

1147
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,200
but this is also tricky because

1148
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,160
it's

1149
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,319
very easy to

1150
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,960
you know like draw a red line on what

1151
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,119
had been perceived

1152
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,079
as a problematic behavior and then it

1153
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,119
creates a meal calculation so another

1154
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,920
activity and an escalation

1155
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,839
and this is grossly said

1156
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,960
but the behavior and just focusing

1157
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,480
every single decision on how estates

1158
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,359
behave is quite dangerous because it can

1159
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,079
create misperception and we don't want

1160
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,280
this

1161
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,160
now

1162
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,319
another approach that was proposed by

1163
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,680
france was to study the effects of an

1164
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,440
attack and

1165
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,560
it's

1166
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,839
detailed in the paper that was submitted

1167
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,079
on the website of the office on

1168
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
disarmament affairs this is a public

1169
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,599
paper you can add

1170
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
you can access it if you type oewg space

1171
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,079
oda and you can have a look at this

1172
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
approach by effect it means that the

1173
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,000
consequences

1174
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,440
of

1175
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,520
a harmful

1176
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,079
operation or a harmful activities it

1177
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,839
what should be taken into consideration

1178
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,800
so this is about quantifying and

1179
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,000
identifying the set of consequences this

1180
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,920
is what matters

1181
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,800
whether they target a system that is

1182
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
commercial or military one we can also

1183
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,640
see that

1184
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,119
in cyberspace

1185
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,319
an activity can spread a code get spread

1186
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,920
through the different infrastructure it

1187
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680
happened in the past it's happening

1188
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,280
right now and it will happen in the

1189
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,079
future and in outer space there is no

1190
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,400
segregated zone where you know like

1191
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
there are military activities from the

1192
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,480
site and commercial activities from

1193
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
another side

1194
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,680
every single

1195
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,599
individual action has collective

1196
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,319
consequences for instance because of the

1197
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,359
creation of debris or because of you

1198
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,680
have like a

1199
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,760
an object that stays in orbit or

1200
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,040
something like this you know this is

1201
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,920
something that must be considered

1202
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,560
so i will put aside for now the issue of

1203
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,119
attribution and this is why i only

1204
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,040
focused on the effects because

1205
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
attribution is a full question and i

1206
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,560
don't have time for this if we want to

1207
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,480
take some of your questions

1208
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,040
so as i said the cyber domain

1209
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,400
incorporated

1210
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,960
is incorporated into military operations

1211
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,280
there is a long-standing

1212
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,440
and increasing reliance on digital

1213
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,720
technologies systems and equipment

1214
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,760
any disruption in cyberspace is an

1215
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,560
underlying source of tensions and with

1216
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,280
space systems all reparation or

1217
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,920
maintenance operation can only be done

1218
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,240
remotely

1219
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,480
with a satellite connecting

1220
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,880
tons of thousands of terminals for

1221
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,680
civilian uses but that also includes the

1222
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,119
management of

1223
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,760
significant sources of energy we've seen

1224
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,640
it with viasat

1225
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
a cyber activity that could disrupt this

1226
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,760
type of system

1227
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,240
has very harmful consequences

1228
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,839
tens of thousands of terminals out

1229
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,079
and it creates also

1230
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,160
bad um

1231
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,359
possibility

1232
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,280
it creates a lack of possibility to

1233
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
manage remotely for instance

1234
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,400
the the

1235
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
the wind

1236
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,319
system you know that provides energy and

1237
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,800
this was this type of of consequences

1238
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,040
that we we want to address

1239
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,560
so

1240
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
if we think about the

1241
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,800
the styling constellation as well i

1242
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
mentioned it a bit earlier you know it's

1243
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,880
a large constellation of satellites

1244
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,160
populating low orbits and providing

1245
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,760
capacities

1246
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,720
to

1247
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,359
all types of actors

1248
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,119
and therefore

1249
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,640
this has the potential to be extremely

1250
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,440
complicated in terms of consequence

1251
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,319
so for instance we talk about populating

1252
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,440
the orbit it can prevent if one of the

1253
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,680
system or the full

1254
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,760
full constellation is down it can

1255
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
prevent or make more difficult the

1256
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,359
access to space

1257
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,400
and all of the access to ttnc so

1258
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
telecommentary telemetry and control

1259
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,319
through the servers the propulsion the

1260
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,880
capacity to avoid collisions

1261
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,160
if they are down

1262
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,319
you know you have thousands of objects

1263
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,160
in orbits that cannot be controlled

1264
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,240
remotely anymore

1265
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,319
any cyber activities

1266
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,240
must be carefully envisaged because of

1267
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,280
the magnitude the importance the damage

1268
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,440
can have

1269
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,319
so

1270
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,800
now another question i will ask is do we

1271
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,839
have time for diplomacy to happen you

1272
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,520
know i mentioned open-ended working

1273
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,079
group and the work that the different

1274
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,920
states are providing it takes time or

1275
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,680
like it was only

1276
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,640
five days in may it will be five days in

1277
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,240
september and states are you know

1278
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
putting together working a lot on how to

1279
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,040
qualify a threat how to find the best

1280
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,520
legal instrument and this type of

1281
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,559
dialogue takes time but the issue is

1282
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,480
that the cyber

1283
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,960
activity in outer space

1284
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,440
it it's happening now it's very much a

1285
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,119
current issue

1286
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,480
and we've been discussing since 1981

1287
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,640
about the prevention of an arms racing

1288
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,079
outer space

1289
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,880
without real concrete outcome

1290
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,520
so far and that's uh that's something

1291
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,280
that could be a bit concerning and this

1292
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,319
is why

1293
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,160
it's it's something that must be a

1294
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,040
political will for for states for

1295
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,520
intergovernmental organizations also to

1296
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,839
just bridge the discussion and to and to

1297
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,640
push it forward

1298
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,079
and

1299
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,319
we must continue these discussions

1300
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,559
considering all the stakeholders

1301
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,200
civilians governmentals military and we

1302
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,920
must we must bridge the discussions and

1303
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,160
i think this is a very important point

1304
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,720
because outer space is a shared domain

1305
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,440
where individual actions as i said

1306
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,480
have very collective consequences and

1307
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,200
with the emergence of new space actors

1308
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,839
both states new states that are new

1309
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
space players

1310
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,920
and the industry players we must bridge

1311
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,000
the discussions at the conference of

1312
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,559
disarmament in geneva but also at the

1313
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,559
committee on the peaceful uses of outer

1314
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,720
space in vienna it's it's not a

1315
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,520
possibility now to work in silos with

1316
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,200
military from the side and commercial

1317
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,520
actors from another side this is just

1318
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,599
bridging discussions not taking

1319
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,559
decisions the one for the other and this

1320
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,400
could be very interesting for the future

1321
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,040
space activities because we can benefit

1322
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,240
from lessons learned we can benefit from

1323
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,760
best practices

1324
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,079
especially in the cyber world and there

1325
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,920
are technologies that are available you

1326
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
know for specific companies

1327
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,760
it takes some time to to be shared a bit

1328
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,520
more broadly

1329
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,480
and this is how we can build for the

1330
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,040
future legal instruments that will be

1331
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,720
efficient

1332
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,319
not necessarily binding but efficient

1333
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,920
and

1334
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,319
what happened with vyasat what happened

1335
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,400
with the stalling constellation

1336
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,040
these are good examples on why

1337
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,920
we have to have this dialogue involving

1338
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,640
all the actors this will help states

1339
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,480
analyze together

1340
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,800
to face misperception issues that could

1341
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,000
lead to misunderstanding and

1342
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,599
miscalculation and

1343
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,640
eventually it will bring more clarity on

1344
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,440
what could elicit a response

1345
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,599
one's behavior you know can be

1346
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,240
triggering a reaction that can have very

1347
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,480
harmful consequences and

1348
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,280
if

1349
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,880
you

1350
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,520
decide to reply or to you know like

1351
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,119
counter

1352
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,480
a current

1353
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,200
um armed attack or current use of force

1354
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,599
because you decided as a state to

1355
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,920
qualify it as user force and to use a

1356
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,160
counter measure you cause debris you

1357
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,800
cause damage you it has also like there

1358
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,359
is a domino effect of consequences

1359
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,319
and

1360
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,160
all of these discussions involving all

1361
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,720
the stakeholder holders they will help

1362
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,640
states to prevent an escalation and

1363
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
perhaps offer a better protection

1364
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,359
overall to all space operators working

1365
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,920
on both the civilian and military side

1366
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,640
because neither in cyber space

1367
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,520
nor in outer space we

1368
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,920
we can deny an interconnection between

1369
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,150
all the stakeholders thank you very much

1370
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:22,800
[Applause]

1371
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,319
thank you very much so if you are

1372
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,000
overwhelmed by now then you know you're

1373
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,240
right that this is a legal session um

1374
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,000
thank you very much for the introduction

1375
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,480
and the also bringing light into this

1376
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,640
very complex environment

1377
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,040
um after each presentation you might get

1378
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,559
the impression that cyber security in

1379
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,640
outer space is not only doubling the

1380
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,559
complexity it's more than that and

1381
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,240
you're not wrong at that conclusion even

1382
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,040
creating a proper situational awareness

1383
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,640
counting ships coming from the navy

1384
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,640
counting airplanes seeing what they are

1385
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,720
flying planes and so on this is not that

1386
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,720
easy in space and we are still at the

1387
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,119
beginning of trying to establish a

1388
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,280
system within the alliance about this

1389
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,440
and actually everything you just heard

1390
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,960
it's not something as i said at the

1391
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,800
beginning theoretically it's happening

1392
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,640
every day at the desk office for space

1393
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,240
policy in the german ministry of defense

1394
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,680
we are having these discussions every

1395
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,440
day in our email boxes on the phone with

1396
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,720
our colleagues of the ministry for

1397
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,079
foreign affairs ministry of

1398
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,240
transportation just national we are also

1399
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,680
having daily calls with the european

1400
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,640
union representatives also with our nato

1401
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
colleagues and so on to really tap into

1402
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,599
this environment

1403
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,920
and i also would like to mention at this

1404
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,000
point before we go to the q a that this

1405
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,440
is the chance of the upcoming space

1406
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,040
command under the nature umbrella to

1407
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,720
really go and tap into this environment

1408
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,359
as well especially the space ue this is

1409
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,359
where i see the lessons then also from

1410
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,119
the center of excellence what we are

1411
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,559
doing here when it comes to cyber

1412
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,800
security this is the vision that the

1413
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,960
space coe and france should have also to

1414
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,319
support the nato and the alliance and

1415
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,520
partners to

1416
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,440
also bring light into these topics but

1417
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,200
let us go to the next slide because we

1418
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,559
prepared a summary for you

1419
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,079
so you can take the pictures during the

1420
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,160
q a and i already saw someone raising

1421
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,240
their hands so the floor is open

1422
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,440
go ahead

1423
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,800
we need some mics thank you

1424
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,440
thank you

1425
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
my name is kubo machak i work at the

1426
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,680
international committee of the red cross

1427
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,119
as a legal advisor

1428
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,440
and so i i'm going to shoot the question

1429
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,520
without having read the summary so

1430
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,119
hopefully it's not answered on the slide

1431
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,000
and i'm going to embarrass myself here

1432
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
so first of all congratulations to all

1433
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,760
three speakers i found all of the

1434
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,599
presentations really illuminating in

1435
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,040
depth and i think what is really

1436
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,280
important is highlighting all the

1437
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,760
threats right and the potential human

1438
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,559
cost that the uses of space assets and

1439
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,079
also this interconnection between

1440
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,480
cyberspace and outer space may have my

1441
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,040
question is for leticia for the uh you

1442
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,520
know the last speech that we have heard

1443
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,680
and i i wanted to unpick

1444
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,440
you know one of the assumptions that you

1445
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,920
have made if i understood you correctly

1446
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,119
towards the beginning of your

1447
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,359
presentation you said that you know what

1448
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
protections are there for space

1449
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,000
operators and for others both civilian

1450
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
and on the military side and i think uh

1451
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,400
the the quote was not so much there is

1452
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
not so much right and you referred to

1453
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,720
the open-ended working group discussions

1454
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,480
that were going on in geneva earlier

1455
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,960
this month and i think it's fair to say

1456
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,480
as you did that

1457
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,160
this there was some discussion about the

1458
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,400
applicability of ihl and of course those

1459
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,240
of us who were here earlier today we

1460
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,720
heard joanna weaver talk about how the

1461
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,040
same kind of arguments were raised in

1462
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,240
the gg and oewg for cyber

1463
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,400
but i would push a little bit back on

1464
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,319
that you know when we say that there are

1465
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,319
no binding rules or we need to think

1466
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,480
about new binding rules

1467
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,680
ihl are those binding rules that we have

1468
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,839
and that

1469
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,440
protects you know the various categories

1470
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,480
of people and also of objects in time of

1471
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
an armed conflict and so

1472
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,200
to the extent that there are some

1473
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,440
arguments that maybe it's premature

1474
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,520
maybe it's politically problematic to

1475
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,720
talk about

1476
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,240
applicability you know we should view

1477
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,599
them in the context of where these

1478
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,680
arguments are made in these diplomatic

1479
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,400
negotiations and we can also bear in

1480
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,160
mind what happened in other processes

1481
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,400
that we have heard about that in the end

1482
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,240
a consensus can be reached on these

1483
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,240
things so but that's maybe you could say

1484
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,160
very soft political point but let's look

1485
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,960
at the hard law so we have article three

1486
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,880
that refers to all international laws

1487
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,480
you have said it incorporates all

1488
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,400
international law so i don't think it's

1489
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,559
much of a stretch to say that ihl is a

1490
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,480
part of international law so it's

1491
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,400
already being incorporated you know

1492
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,480
through this way then in iho we have

1493
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,880
article 36 which tells us the diet show

1494
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,960
article 36 of the first additional

1495
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,280
protocol which tells us that iho is a

1496
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,440
technology neutral body of law whenever

1497
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,799
there is a new technology being

1498
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,920
developed

1499
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,680
you know it's subject to legal reviews

1500
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,079
an obligation of legal reviews whether

1501
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,920
it complies with ih on so that would

1502
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,440
probably also apply to space

1503
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,760
applications we have the logic of the

1504
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
nuclear weapons advisory opinion which

1505
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,680
says that ihl applies to all kinds of

1506
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,359
weapons those of the past those of the

1507
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,280
present those of the future so hopefully

1508
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,119
again we can extend this to the space

1509
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,280
environment so i think there are very

1510
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,040
strong arguments and on top of

1511
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,880
everything when we talk about these

1512
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,960
double complexities between cyber and

1513
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
space we also have the acknowledgement

1514
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,920
in the cyber context in the gg that ihl

1515
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,599
applies so

1516
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,799
i i wonder you know if we're not

1517
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,119
doing ourselves a disservice by opening

1518
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,079
by reopening this can of worms that has

1519
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,319
been closed at least in some ways and i

1520
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,240
would be curious to hear the views of

1521
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,480
the panelists on that thank you yeah

1522
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,640
thank you very much let's go the other

1523
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,720
and backwards like first ladies and

1524
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
gentle and then seth and of course

1525
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,640
backed up by legit logistical support by

1526
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,400
mike schmidt

1527
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,839
thank you very much for your question

1528
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,839
and i'm very happy to see that there is

1529
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,480
a representative from the icrc attending

1530
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,200
to this panel um indeed

1531
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,319
it's a topic that

1532
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,000
according to some states should be you

1533
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,160
know like a self-planning

1534
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
topic so it should be

1535
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,520
obvious that ihl applies to this type of

1536
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,319
activities that are being carried out in

1537
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,079
outer space

1538
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,400
it's not so obvious and we have to

1539
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,799
open the discussion your colleague wenzu

1540
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,520
from geneva she took part in the

1541
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,400
discussion

1542
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,880
last month and she made a brilliant

1543
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,440
presentation of the applicability of

1544
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,480
international humanitarian law and a lot

1545
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,880
of states just agreed with the

1546
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,480
applicability of international

1547
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,280
humanitarian law but

1548
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,040
some states that

1549
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,960
may be considered as

1550
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,119
important players

1551
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,520
decided that it will not apply for some

1552
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,640
reason one of them would be if

1553
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
don't feel free to have a look at the

1554
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,000
documents i mentioned on the oewg but

1555
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,240
that considering that ihl applies would

1556
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,319
be considering that

1557
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,880
outer space is

1558
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,799
open for conflict ghostly states and

1559
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,960
this is something that really triggered

1560
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,640
some reactions

1561
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,079
and

1562
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,520
this is something that we must

1563
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,040
vote we as you know states um

1564
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,920
we must vote and put on the paper and be

1565
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,799
sure about and yes we have to open the

1566
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,880
discussion we have to write it down we

1567
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,480
have to have the signature at the bottom

1568
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,880
of the page and then it will be obvious

1569
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,480
julia do you have comments yes i don't

1570
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,359
have much to add actually and i totally

1571
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,280
agree actually that

1572
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,960
we should now acknowledge that it's just

1573
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,559
applicable of course to the space

1574
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,640
context and it's actually quite

1575
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,880
surprising that the same states that

1576
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,000
then object to the applicability of ihl

1577
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,839
then develop for instance counter space

1578
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,599
capabilities as part of their defense

1579
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,319
policies even without recognizing space

1580
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,000
explicitly as they were fighting domains

1581
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,440
so actually there's a bit of dichotomy

1582
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,799
in that regard

1583
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,240
so i agree on that and then i think that

1584
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,600
um

1585
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,839
[Music]

1586
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,000
the the necessary step

1587
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,720
is really to jump immediately in

1588
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,000
in what could be the consequences of the

1589
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,319
space counter space conducted within

1590
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,240
armed conflict because then there is the

1591
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,440
real

1592
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,680
meat of the real substance of the

1593
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,280
discussion

1594
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,200
i think it's pretentious right now and

1595
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,440
it's a political probably a supposition

1596
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,359
to continue to

1597
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,640
um

1598
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,000
to

1599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,839
back to

1600
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,839
contrast this approach to the

1601
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,000
application of ihl and it reflects in

1602
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,960
fact as leticia was was mentioning

1603
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,000
years actually of of um

1604
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,520
of um

1605
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,119
documents proposed within the the the cd

1606
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,359
that just told the discussion in fact

1607
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,960
and so

1608
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,760
that's my comment yeah so yeah i think

1609
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,280
the conversation around your question

1610
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
really depends on what protections we're

1611
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,440
talking about so if we're talking about

1612
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,799
protections

1613
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:03,839
um

1614
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,359
in armed conflicts then yeah i i i think

1615
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,160
this is a great conversation to have um

1616
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
certainly the you know we've got the

1617
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,480
article 3 reference to international law

1618
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
that's been that's been discussed

1619
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,839
one of my

1620
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,480
you know go-to quotes from one of our

1621
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,640
dod senior leaders is there's no such

1622
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,319
thing as war in space or there's no such

1623
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,799
thing as cyber war it's just war

1624
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,799
right so whether it extends to to

1625
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,960
whatever domain the maritime land air

1626
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,079
domain

1627
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,400
it's going to be the same it's just war

1628
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,319
and so it's just conflict but if we're

1629
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,000
talking about

1630
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,400
instead of instead of those kind of

1631
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,640
protections and instead talking about

1632
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,640
protections for um harmful interference

1633
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,440
for example well that's that's

1634
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,599
a little more complex

1635
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,559
of a

1636
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,640
protection based on language in the

1637
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,160
outer space treaty that's that's

1638
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,319
undefined

1639
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,880
that language at least in in article

1640
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,559
nine and i won't get too geeky and

1641
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,240
presume that everybody has memorized the

1642
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,240
outer space treaty i know

1643
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,359
there are

1644
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,760
only a few of us that level of

1645
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,200
of nerdiness i guess but if

1646
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,920
article 9 says that you can't harmfully

1647
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,640
interfere with another another nation's

1648
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,559
freedom of exploration of outer space

1649
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,799
without first consulting it doesn't mean

1650
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,960
you can't do it it's not a prohibition

1651
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,480
it says you can't consult and of course

1652
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,799
we've seen states do that

1653
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,960
but that's an example of a protection

1654
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,680
that that at least in state practice

1655
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,760
hasn't been as solidified so i i love

1656
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,839
the question i think it depends on on

1657
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,160
the you know i'll give a good lawyer

1658
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,480
answer it depends it depends on the kind

1659
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,640
of protections that we're talking about

1660
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,559
and certainly it's it's worth exploring

1661
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,200
and and fodder for all sorts of academic

1662
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,280
articles for someone to write

1663
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,559
thanks

1664
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,039
thank you some additional comments serve

1665
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,400
you mate

1666
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,839
uh are you

1667
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,839
hi i'm i'm mike schmidt one you were

1668
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,480
looking for earlier um

1669
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,119
let me add to what kubo said kubo went

1670
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,839
to oxford so we gave you a very detailed

1671
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,119
scholarly

1672
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,359
view i went to the university of texas

1673
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,119
so let me tell you what i told the

1674
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,280
chinese ambassador on the issue of the

1675
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,680
applicability mr ambassador that's

1676
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,760
absolute nonsense

1677
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,520
and the same is true with regard to

1678
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,240
space anyone who suggests that ihl does

1679
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,920
not apply in space is a lousy lawyer

1680
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,000
because it is crystal clear i'm 112

1681
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,880
certain that ihl applies in space so i

1682
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,119
don't feel strongly about this

1683
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,200
but there's my view but that's not my

1684
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,440
question my question is for the colonel

1685
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,440
i think there's an interesting situation

1686
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,319
going on with starlink providing

1687
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,920
information that's valuable to the

1688
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,799
ukrainians to conduct hostilities

1689
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,880
if under and you probably anticipated

1690
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,480
this question i'm sure you've talked

1691
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,480
about it at the office

1692
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,000
if

1693
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,880
a state is responsible for its national

1694
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,839
activities then i assume

1695
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,079
the united states is responsible for the

1696
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,400
activities of starlink

1697
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,400
so how does that tie into neutrality

1698
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,920
if starlink is giving militarily useful

1699
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,000
information to the ukrainians a

1700
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,039
belligerent party to an armed conflict

1701
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,599
would that mean that the united states

1702
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,720
would be in breach of any neutrality

1703
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,119
obligation now it isn't

1704
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,559
i'm not trying to do a stump the dummy

1705
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,480
question my view is no

1706
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,640
because i'm an advocate along with wolf

1707
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,480
von heinig and a few others of the

1708
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,119
doctrine called qualified neutrality but

1709
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,760
i haven't heard the united states speak

1710
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,839
to this issue so i'm wondering if you

1711
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,920
could give me a sense of what what the

1712
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,720
americans are talking about yeah thanks

1713
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,599
so

1714
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,760
uh the starlink situation's fascinating

1715
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,440
already right so we've got a private

1716
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,839
actor in a world that we that we really

1717
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,760
haven't seen something like this before

1718
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,440
a private actor

1719
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,640
supplying

1720
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,680
you know one of the one of the states

1721
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,359
with uh with with a useful tool and what

1722
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,280
has been proven to be a useful tool at

1723
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,880
least what we've seen over the last few

1724
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,440
months um

1725
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,920
but the state itself is is is trying to

1726
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,359
stay neutral

1727
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,799
um or at least at least presumably so

1728
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,960
responsibility um i wouldn't so i take

1729
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,559
an expansive view of responsibility

1730
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,319
right i have colleagues who wouldn't say

1731
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,520
that it expands as much as as i've

1732
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,160
asserted here today in in financial

1733
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,520
obligations

1734
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,240
that said um i think the responsibility

1735
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,039
provision um would expand to something

1736
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,720
like starlink in a financial

1737
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,119
perspective

1738
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,680
well because

1739
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,240
well

1740
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,000
put that aside why are they not

1741
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,200
responsible for scarlet's actions

1742
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,520
which means that they're us actions

1743
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
which means that's a breach of classic

1744
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,720
neutrality

1745
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,680
sure

1746
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,880
sure um definitely could be i mean so

1747
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,640
i'll speak from my own perspective again

1748
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,400
right um because i don't know what the

1749
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,720
the u.s stance is or what it's going to

1750
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,359
be over the next few months um

1751
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,000
i think of responsibility as as like i

1752
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,480
said financial and regulatory framework

1753
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,160
starlink has to operate under the

1754
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,760
regulatory framework of the united

1755
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,319
states and they will have to do so

1756
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,160
because that's where they're licensed to

1757
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,760
operate and that's

1758
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,240
largely where they've launched from i

1759
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,920
may be wrong on some of the details as

1760
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,400
far as where they've launched from

1761
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,680
regardless they needed u.s licenses to

1762
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,760
operate all of these satellites in lower

1763
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,960
earth orbit

1764
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,200
um

1765
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,039
that might be tested a little bit more

1766
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,640
right i mean the us wants to support the

1767
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,880
ukraine and support this company that's

1768
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,520
helping ukraine and so if they're going

1769
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,079
to be in violation of regulation

1770
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,760
would we expect this company to be the

1771
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,680
company to do that yeah maybe

1772
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,920
and uh that may test the regulatory

1773
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,559
framework of the u.s as far as it hits

1774
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,319
the neutrality issue then um

1775
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,720
yeah the united states is responsible

1776
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,880
for their actions and so far that the

1777
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,640
united states can can control this

1778
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,039
company right so maybe in in other

1779
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,640
states they may be able to control a

1780
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,039
private actor a little bit more or a

1781
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,440
little bit less but

1782
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,599
they certainly have some responsibility

1783
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,760
to control this actor

1784
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,799
um to what extent is to be determined so

1785
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,599
uh uh i'll i'll

1786
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,880
take the take the side of you of

1787
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,520
qualified um neutrality because i think

1788
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,520
that's an important and an important

1789
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,280
aspect of it where you know some people

1790
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,880
haven't haven't gone that far thanks for

1791
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,960
the question yeah fantastic discussion

1792
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,520
thank you roll number three please

1793
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,839
thank

1794
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,480
you

1795
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,839
hi thank you so much for the discussion

1796
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,119
my name is soph lubin i'm associate

1797
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,799
professor of law at indiana university

1798
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,200
um my question is also for colonel

1799
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,920
dilworth and it directly ties to the

1800
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,000
summary provided on the screen of what

1801
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,160
was a great presentation i'm

1802
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,240
i i when i not don't don't teach

1803
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,520
international landscape security law i

1804
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,280
teach tour law and so i'm really curious

1805
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,238
about the way you've taken your analysis

1806
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,839
and and i have two questions in that

1807
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,439
regard one is the use of intervening

1808
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,839
action phraseology from

1809
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:26,799
what is

1810
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,759
predominantly common law doctrines

1811
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,000
i'd be curious your understanding of how

1812
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,479
you conceptualize them as intervening

1813
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,040
and or superseding causes particularly

1814
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,000
as it relates to how commonplace cyber

1815
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,399
attacks have become and cyber intrusions

1816
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,439
have become

1817
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,880
and therefore whether they are

1818
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,198
foreseeable or not foreseeable anymore

1819
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,439
justifying or not justifying relieving

1820
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,880
of liability

1821
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,479
state b using your example um and

1822
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,640
whether we should whole state be liable

1823
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,439
if it failed to comply with basic cyber

1824
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,520
security measures and i i only raised

1825
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,600
this because we've seen many

1826
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,399
private entities in domestic contexts

1827
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,640
rely on intervening superseding causes

1828
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,799
in the context of vulnerability abuses

1829
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,158
that they could have stopped by saying

1830
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:13,839
uh but china did it so i should not be

1831
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,920
held liable so i'm curious to hear how

1832
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,560
you play that so that's question one

1833
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,719
question two is about insurance

1834
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,600
so the more we rely on the liability

1835
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,560
convention in the cyber context the more

1836
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,759
that i'm worried about insurers willing

1837
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,279
to ensure

1838
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,600
outer space practices which we already

1839
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,399
have witnessed a decline um and

1840
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:39,120
concerned by insurers and now when we

1841
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,359
add cyber issues i can only imagine they

1842
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,319
will want to pull out even more

1843
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,198
yeah thank a man a question from a torts

1844
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,880
professor this is great

1845
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,080
um

1846
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,158
yeah so a lot a lot of this is kind of

1847
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,800
borrowed from from tort law right um

1848
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
certainly those with common-law states

1849
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,400
can can

1850
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,239
relate to maybe conversations about

1851
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,880
negligence and comparative

1852
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,440
comparative fault and things like that

1853
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,679
um

1854
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,360
all right so i guess i would i would say

1855
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,520
um

1856
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,440
yeah it's it really is similar

1857
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,159
should a state anticipate cyber actions

1858
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,320
against it against its satellite i would

1859
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,360
say yes in a modern era now our problem

1860
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,040
and we had an awesome conversation last

1861
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,560
night

1862
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,640
you know

1863
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,880
really geeky conversation between a

1864
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,080
bunch of of uh space lawyers over drinks

1865
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,960
last night but um uh where we were

1866
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,920
talking a little bit about uh about this

1867
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,679
conversation should we expect it well we

1868
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,159
have modern satellites that do that now

1869
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,440
our problem is we've got a whole bunch

1870
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,760
of satellites on orbit that are that are

1871
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,199
sometimes decades old do they have those

1872
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,640
patches or do they have even the

1873
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,480
capability to have some of these

1874
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,679
vulnerabilities short up well i i don't

1875
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,040
know

1876
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,199
um and that's that's probably a great

1877
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,360
question for some of our astro engineers

1878
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,159
who

1879
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,400
who can talk about that or maybe maybe

1880
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,880
can't talk about it right um

1881
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,440
so yes and no and i think that parlays

1882
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,199
into your second question about

1883
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,719
insurance

1884
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:19,679
um

1885
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,679
insurance is getting way more complex

1886
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,520
already when it comes to you know we

1887
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,520
have these these multi-million dollar

1888
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,320
space robots

1889
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,400
you know conducting all sorts of

1890
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,239
activities that we

1891
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,440
as as world citizens all rely on for

1892
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,760
banking for navigating for trying to get

1893
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,239
to the to the icebreaker last night for

1894
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,000
all sorts of stuff

1895
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,840
and and these insurers want to want to

1896
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,440
play a part in it partly because there's

1897
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,360
a huge financial incentive for them to

1898
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,960
do so but once it gets more complex not

1899
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,520
just with the the the space operations

1900
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,640
all the debris um but also with the the

1901
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,560
cyber operations i think they're going

1902
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,880
to overlay their their cyber framework

1903
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,719
this is what i would think of as insurer

1904
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,800
if it was me overlay your cyber

1905
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,040
framework that you're already using on

1906
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,960
the ground for terrestrial cyber

1907
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,719
capabilities right

1908
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,040
that includes how much should they be

1909
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,880
protecting already and how much security

1910
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,080
should they have

1911
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,640
put that on top of whatever space

1912
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,960
framework that you you have as well and

1913
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,920
you're going to have to do this in

1914
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,640
degrees because some countries have the

1915
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,640
ability to launch satellites with more

1916
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,880
cyber protections than others some

1917
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,440
countries have older satellites that are

1918
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,840
going to last maybe a long time and

1919
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,080
maybe not so long and some countries

1920
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,960
just don't have that capability at all

1921
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:41,760
so

1922
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,840
again it depends but i think we're

1923
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,159
emphasizing one of the complexities here

1924
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,480
um and a reason to have more panels like

1925
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,800
this right because the crossovers we've

1926
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,520
always had bend silos of this is cyber

1927
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,840
this is space this is maritime this is

1928
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,719
air and the crossover is just just just

1929
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,520
so profound right now that um uh these

1930
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,679
conversations are are fascinating thanks

1931
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,239
for the question

1932
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,400
you also want to yes i want to add

1933
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,560
something to the insurance issue because

1934
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,800
i think that actually that could also be

1935
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,080
managed through um stm regimes

1936
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,159
i mean all the international community

1937
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,840
not only the space community we are

1938
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,600
witnessing the

1939
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,080
rise of a new concept for space traffic

1940
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,760
management and new

1941
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,560
regional approaches and framework to stm

1942
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,679
so part of the stm and stm framework is

1943
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,600
also the legal component

1944
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,719
and how actually it will be at least how

1945
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:37,920
the

1946
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,320
state discharge it inside

1947
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,400
itself from

1948
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,719
the obligation to control and authorize

1949
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,159
its national activities so if we ground

1950
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,840
insurance regimes

1951
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
to um

1952
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,679
to the mission itself and to to the

1953
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,840
authorization to perform emissions and

1954
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,719
so on

1955
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,120
these will will inevitably lead to an

1956
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,679
insurance mechanism that will be agreed

1957
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,000
initially for sure at the regional level

1958
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,920
and then once all the different systems

1959
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,480
are integrated at the more international

1960
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,640
level through practices at least some

1961
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,480
practices agreed

1962
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,679
so

1963
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,920
thank you yes i don't have a lot to add

1964
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,159
but just it's also about risk mitigation

1965
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,880
measures right it's also about uh does

1966
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,760
the company take the choice to invest in

1967
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,640
some

1968
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,719
technologies protective technologies

1969
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,960
safety measures you know like preventing

1970
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,239
any risk

1971
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,040
of

1972
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,920
having like an internal bridge it's how

1973
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,000
the does the company prove to the

1974
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,159
insurance company for instance that they

1975
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,120
acted as a reasonable and prudent actor

1976
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,719
and this way you know we can see that

1977
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,280
they took into consideration all the

1978
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,880
different factors and another point is

1979
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,280
shall state when granting the license

1980
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,840
you know authorizing the space

1981
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,760
activities uh school include also cyber

1982
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,080
security by design you mentioned it

1983
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,800
it's like julia got it all you know like

1984
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,199
by design they should have at least some

1985
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,400
protections

1986
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,880
but this goes again through stm regimes

1987
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,280
at the national level so you could

1988
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,040
you can

1989
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,640
rise the level of protection and

1990
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,120
security that you want to ensure to the

1991
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,800
different missions that the different

1992
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,560
mission ensures so

1993
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,400
thank you very much if i may add as well

1994
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,000
and also to advertise a little bit about

1995
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
the experience in a maritime domain so

1996
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,760
actually the questions are quite similar

1997
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,640
if you see a ship at sea um outdated

1998
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,760
systems

1999
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,080
unpatched and always connected so kind

2000
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,400
of a similar situation however the

2001
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,320
united nations international maritime

2002
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,640
organization is pretty strong in

2003
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,640
comparison and there you see an entity

2004
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,040
that is strong enough to

2005
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,400
create guidelines and they will be

2006
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,080
adopted with different companies or

2007
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,000
other organizations and kind of spread

2008
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,560
regionally and with time you get

2009
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,480
something at the end of the production

2010
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,840
life circle

2011
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,600
however we and in our discussions we

2012
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
don't see that in a space environment

2013
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,320
yet i mean uh the existing offices they

2014
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,560
are not strong enough in comparison so

2015
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,480
we hope that your european union

2016
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,400
approach or whatever could help us in

2017
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,239
this regard thank you next question

2018
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,120
please

2019
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,159
for throw fifth row

2020
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,800
um hi thanks to panelists um pete cooper

2021
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,120
um

2022
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,159
one of the

2023
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,239
things that sort of strikes me is that

2024
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:25,920
a satellite happens to be a computer

2025
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,440
that's in orbit with fantastic

2026
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,880
connectivity

2027
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,040
um an aircraft happens to be a computer

2028
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,840
that flies with the fantastic

2029
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,679
connectivity and we're looking at

2030
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,000
increasingly a blurred line between

2031
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,960
aviation suborbital and orbital

2032
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,800
do you see a lot of

2033
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,040
where the domain is going for space did

2034
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,000
you see

2035
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,840
parallels being drawn between aviation

2036
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,360
and space and

2037
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,280
and learning lessons from the aviation

2038
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,679
um area and why ko have been doing and

2039
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:54,880
what different states been doing and

2040
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,360
you've mentioned maritime for example

2041
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,320
um

2042
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,400
how do we how do we project forward to

2043
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,640
make this easier for for both

2044
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,640
manufacturers and operators of the

2045
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,080
assets that are going to be straddling

2046
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,520
both of these domains in the future

2047
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,120
because it feels weird to be splitting

2048
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,960
them

2049
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,120
good question wants to go first any

2050
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,560
ideas

2051
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,239
i'll go first so we're see we're seeing

2052
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,880
in some um

2053
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,560
cases

2054
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,159
we'll use the space force for example

2055
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,400
just recently i think with even the last

2056
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
week um there's been some media about

2057
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,440
the the the new the new cyber framework

2058
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,000
for for the space force right and i i

2059
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,480
i haven't seen it um but i i suspect

2060
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,520
that

2061
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,920
is going to be similar to a lot of the

2062
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,480
other broad regulatory framework that is

2063
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,199
just that it's just broad that says we

2064
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,320
need to have

2065
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,960
um um

2066
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,320
you know redundancies um shore up vulner

2067
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,400
no vulnerabilities things like that and

2068
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,920
the capability

2069
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,800
to

2070
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,640
build it up in the future

2071
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,280
um i think i think some of those are the

2072
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,960
lessons learned that we that we're

2073
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,880
getting from the maritime domain like

2074
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,679
like patrick just talked about um

2075
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,080
but ultimately i think i think that's it

2076
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,159
i think they're going to be broad and i

2077
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,080
think we're going to have to see

2078
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,120
um

2079
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,800
um because we can't we can fix

2080
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,880
everything right now and then launch it

2081
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,159
into space five years from now it won't

2082
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,679
be an it'll

2083
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,080
you know we're gonna have more issues so

2084
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,960
um overall to me it sounds like um the

2085
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,560
capabilities and some of the lessons

2086
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,239
learned that we've we've

2087
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,679
seen from the other domains are um are

2088
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,640
really just that capability questions

2089
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,560
can we give it the capability to to

2090
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,679
become more secure i don't know if you

2091
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,400
have something else and if i may add a

2092
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,480
point on the you know like a application

2093
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,000
of analogies

2094
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,400
there is a possibility to draw some

2095
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,920
parallel between what's happening in the

2096
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,239
maritime sector of course aviation

2097
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,360
sector

2098
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,360
these are discussions that are occurring

2099
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,480
between experts and diplomats in may

2100
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
my colleagues charles doddler from the

2101
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,719
university of mississippi and al modenaz

2102
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,280
garado ortega from unity they discussed

2103
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,239
about these different analogies and the

2104
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,320
diplomats were extremely receptive to

2105
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,320
these type of things because

2106
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,280
in the end if we have if we are are

2107
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,760
applying the best practices from a field

2108
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,159
to another it's it's the best defense

2109
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,280
you know like

2110
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,360
and the best defense is also the best

2111
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,360
it's events against an attack if i may

2112
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,239
so

2113
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,920
this is definitely something that is

2114
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,400
taken into consideration and also if we

2115
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,159
if we think about the space domain as a

2116
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:36,080
whole um um like the iko has its own

2117
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,480
system and i know that the past few

2118
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,120
years there were discussion about exo so

2119
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,360
international uh civil space

2120
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,960
organization

2121
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,800
and it's it's a big question there are

2122
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,280
discussions happening there are debates

2123
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,760
in the end it's i guess states and big

2124
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,120
players that will

2125
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,679
take the final decisions but

2126
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,440
these are current discussions i don't

2127
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,320
have a final answer for this

2128
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,640
yes just to add actually yes there are

2129
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,800
analogies that have been drawn also at

2130
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,280
the really

2131
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,679
consensus building among states and and

2132
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,480
then in international negotiations

2133
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,960
both actually with the law of the sea

2134
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,040
and and

2135
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,840
her the law of airspace

2136
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,480
um and always in relation to the safety

2137
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,840
of of the space objects so

2138
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,320
analogies actually have been

2139
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,400
drawn for stm

2140
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,040
with the eko of course and specifically

2141
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,400
actually with the chicago convention

2142
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,159
there are a lot of provisions that in

2143
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,040
fact

2144
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,440
can find can be adapted or somehow

2145
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,440
tailored to to

2146
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,760
um to address the the space complexity

2147
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,480
uh but also on the and this is more for

2148
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,800
really the part of the safety uh

2149
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,040
requirements and the in terms of sharing

2150
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,440
of information that is very much linked

2151
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,560
actually to

2152
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,600
to

2153
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,239
the the law of the air but on the other

2154
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,960
side also with the law of the sea it's

2155
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,719
very interesting the analogy because

2156
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,120
some of the the main freedoms in the

2157
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,120
outer space are actually

2158
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,600
resemblance to the the freedom of the

2159
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,080
high seas so of course there is a

2160
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,400
connection within uh with the two

2161
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,800
domains and there it's very interesting

2162
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,400
for instance to draw analogies for

2163
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,199
instance on the enforcement part than on

2164
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,880
any stm regime

2165
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,440
so actually space is already learning

2166
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,760
lessons from from the other uh regimes

2167
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,520
by analogy

2168
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,960
yeah this is also what like i would like

2169
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,199
to comment here is kind of not to see

2170
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,280
the chicago convention or the law of the

2171
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,600
sea convention is kind of by article but

2172
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,880
article or provision by provision more

2173
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,800
or less like the lessons learned how to

2174
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,120
get so many nations on the same table to

2175
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,719
agree upon the same things um i'm still

2176
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,159
surprised that this has happened in the

2177
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:53,040
past still wonder for me and i hope this

2178
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,880
i seriously hope this will not happen in

2179
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,719
a way like it did in the past that we

2180
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,120
need some accidents in space to then

2181
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,960
finally come on the same table maybe we

2182
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,960
can finally extract what we have learned

2183
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,639
in that processes and to do it

2184
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,120
beforehand

2185
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,840
next question

2186
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,560
please over to you

2187
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,960
okay

2188
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,280
thanks to the panelists for a wonderful

2189
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,760
presentation so my name is jacob i'm a

2190
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,000
law professor in the czech republic

2191
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,280
and i have a question i would like to

2192
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,040
circle back because i like silly

2193
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,520
hypotheticals so i would like to circle

2194
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,880
back on the issue of qualified

2195
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,440
neutrality and a star link in ukraine

2196
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,040
russian situation

2197
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,560
and my question is if u.s is still

2198
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,120
neutral but starling is providing

2199
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,560
crucial services to ukrainian army

2200
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,719
what if russian federation decides to

2201
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,800
shut down styling satellites is it

2202
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,719
violating neutrality

2203
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,360
or because kind of the capability to

2204
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,960
launch satellites and provide these

2205
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,040
types of services is a bottleneck in a

2206
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,400
way not every state can do it so

2207
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,560
can we outsource these sort of

2208
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,280
capabilities to ensure that the

2209
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,960
infrastructure is going to be

2210
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,040
untouchable so we wouldn't violate the

2211
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,920
neutrality of non-participating state or

2212
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,040
is there

2213
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,280
is this city hypothetical in any way

2214
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,280
going in the right direction i'm risking

2215
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,280
that mike's going to berate me for not

2216
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,040
knowing this i understand that perfectly

2217
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,880
i'm willing to take the risk so this is

2218
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,560
my question thank you

2219
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,679
i didn't realize we had so many

2220
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,480
professors in here

2221
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,760
that's right it made me a little more

2222
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,360
nervous um i want to make sure i get

2223
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,199
your hypothetical correct so so you're

2224
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:42,800
saying if if russia um

2225
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
impedes starlink's ability to provide

2226
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,400
that service to the ukrainians is that

2227
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,080
right

2228
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,880
yeah um

2229
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
so my mind immediately goes to and maybe

2230
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,280
just because i i think of the the space

2231
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,440
law architecture first my mind

2232
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,960
immediately goes to

2233
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,400
um

2234
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,560
and they probably have other thoughts on

2235
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,120
the neutrality of the outer space treaty

2236
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,560
right so we've got a freedom of

2237
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,280
exploration provision that has been

2238
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,159
argued is also customary international

2239
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,120
law

2240
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,800
um

2241
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,480
you know sputnik launched 10 years

2242
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,840
before the outer space treaty and the us

2243
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,440
in response

2244
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,040
did nothing

2245
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,679
right didn't criticize the soviet union

2246
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,800
but instead tried to develop

2247
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,679
other satellites to launch because we

2248
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,840
wanted the freedom of exploration as

2249
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,679
well in fact that was that was

2250
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,000
you know one of one of the main points

2251
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
of agreement

2252
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,600
um in the outer space treaty that didn't

2253
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,320
have to be left vague and now we might

2254
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,080
consider it vague freedom of exploration

2255
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,600
is fairly big um or broad but

2256
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,880
um

2257
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,480
so we've got starlink an actor that's

2258
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,920
the united states has responsibility

2259
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,719
over

2260
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,520
and uh they're conducting operations

2261
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,679
activities in outer space and they have

2262
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,280
a freedom to explore and if if if

2263
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,719
russia is interfering with that then i

2264
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,560
think of course there's no enforcement

2265
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,360
mechanism but i think we have uh

2266
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,600
at least a point of contention under the

2267
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,400
outer space treaty that we can we can

2268
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,320
try to resolve diplomatically or some

2269
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,660
other way

2270
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,840
[Music]

2271
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,159
i've talked enough about neutrality so

2272
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,239
i'll let um leticia talk about it

2273
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,280
because i think she's got some thoughts

2274
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,639
on her as well

2275
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,800
let's say that

2276
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,960
it's about protection

2277
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,000
of

2278
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,120
thoughts perspective view and power of

2279
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,040
course and

2280
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,520
you know like i believe your question is

2281
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,239
which bridged more with the question

2282
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,639
from the icrc than with the question of

2283
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,480
michael schmitz because

2284
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,400
what happened is that

2285
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,280
some states including russia contest the

2286
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,920
application of some worlds

2287
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,000
that other states

2288
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,360
agree on

2289
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,400
and this is what we must consider and

2290
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,800
this will be more diplomatic issue than

2291
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,120
a legal issue and this is why i don't

2292
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,639
have like a

2293
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,800
strong answer strong reply to your

2294
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,719
question

2295
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,480
yes i don't have

2296
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,840
either

2297
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,600
a precise answer but maybe an

2298
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,920
observation because which is actually

2299
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,000
very interesting that this could

2300
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,760
actually lead to

2301
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,560
understand and to feel of content

2302
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,000
how states should

2303
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,679
should

2304
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,840
ensure the respect of their obligations

2305
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,679
under the outer space treaty because if

2306
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,440
we link it to the responsibility and the

2307
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,440
regime of objective responsibility that

2308
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,639
is unique to to to the space domain

2309
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,159
then

2310
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,120
the answer could be that the us is not

2311
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,760
performing its duty to control and

2312
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,520
supervise is

2313
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,840
its nation as activities

2314
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,239
so if we link that to that

2315
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:59,520
then

2316
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,480
we can understand if the the state is

2317
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,719
violating or not it's

2318
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,480
its neutrality

2319
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,360
so

2320
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,199
i think actually they should be analyzed

2321
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,080
in relation to the space law regime

2322
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,600
thank you professor schmidt you would

2323
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,760
like to add something

2324
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,080
mike and first row thank you you are

2325
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,960
looking to igai

2326
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,080
so listen i think there's a lot of

2327
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,320
confusion about neutrality neutrality is

2328
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,639
about a state violating its legal

2329
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,880
obligation which is why i asked the

2330
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,960
question of the colonel i was trying to

2331
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,719
determine whether or not we could say

2332
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,920
that a starlink operation is

2333
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,560
attributable to the state by virtue of

2334
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,360
article 6 of the outer space treaty

2335
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,400
i'm

2336
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,719
kind of with the kernel i'm not so sure

2337
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,520
you can say that so let's say you cannot

2338
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,440
say it's the operation of the united

2339
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,480
states

2340
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,480
that being the case there's no longer a

2341
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,880
neutrality question why because the

2342
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,120
object is in the commons

2343
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,360
if the object was in the united states

2344
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,600
or then you may have an opera you may

2345
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,920
have a neutrality but i i don't think

2346
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,600
there's a neutrality

2347
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,159
issue unless you want to argue that the

2348
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,000
united states is responsible for putting

2349
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,480
into the operations the guidance and so

2350
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,639
forth on the ground but here's the real

2351
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,639
answer to your question the real answer

2352
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,400
to your question is that's a military

2353
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,000
objective

2354
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,239
okay that's pretty crystal clear if that

2355
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,239
starlink is providing information that

2356
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,080
the ukrainians are using to conduct

2357
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,560
military operations it's a military

2358
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,560
objective and it happens to be sitting

2359
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,320
in the commons that means the russians

2360
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,400
can shoot it down i think it's that

2361
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,600
simple

2362
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,600
and not only that but we're we're seeing

2363
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,159
this is this is a great conversation

2364
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,320
i know or we're short on time

2365
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,920
um cyber and space both have a lot of a

2366
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,040
lot of

2367
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,719
assets if we call it that or

2368
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,840
capabilities that are dual use

2369
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,400
dual use then becomes

2370
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,560
lawful targets

2371
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,800
understandably so right so if we're

2372
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,400
talking commercial space and there could

2373
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,480
be you know there could be conferences

2374
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,800
and papers and books on commercial space

2375
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,639
and we're developing that i think over

2376
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,600
over the next couple of years we're

2377
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,440
going to see more of that but commercial

2378
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,000
space actors are cognizant of that

2379
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,320
right spacex was well aware what they

2380
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,760
were doing when they put a bunch of

2381
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,120
starlink

2382
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,600
capabilities within the ukraine they

2383
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,199
know that they can become a lawful

2384
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,719
target at the same ti

2385
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,639
and it was very public what russia did

2386
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,639
to their own satellite in lower earth

2387
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:32,560
orbit uh last november so um

2388
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,719
lawful targets

2389
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,120
ripe for conversation right for academic

2390
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,520
discussions um over the over the next

2391
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,719
few years both in cyber and in space and

2392
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:44,560
i would posit both of them together as

2393
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,920
well

2394
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,719
and

2395
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,800
also it's not only about like dual use

2396
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,560
there is another distinction that is

2397
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,320
dual purpose you know like this dual

2398
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,400
uses more like the gnss

2399
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,199
capabilities that are used by both uh

2400
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,920
type of actors dual purpose is for

2401
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,639
instance a civilian object that will be

2402
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,600
diverted to be used for destructive

2403
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,639
purpose

2404
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,480
and this is really something that will

2405
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,840
also trigger additional questions

2406
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,159
so thank you very much unfortunately and

2407
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,840
we need to close this session however

2408
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,120
please give a

2409
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,480
great applause for the subject matter

2410
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,310
experts here

2411
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:24,479
