1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,280
well thank you very much and good

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,040
morning everybody after what was i

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
thinking an excellent day yesterday and

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
our thanks from fortinet and from all of

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
us to everyone at the center of

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
excellence excellence here in tallinn

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,759
for such a high protein strategic level

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,880
morning and then some excellent

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,199
workshops in the afternoon so we all

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,320
enjoyed that i know um i was just

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
also reminiscing about the fact that we

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
uh at fortinet have been sponsors before

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
uh here at the event but we're really

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
proud of our association and the theme

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
yesterday i think which weave through

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,640
everybody is that this theme of the

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,559
conference to keep moving is really

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
important we must keep moving and part

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
of that this morning with the speakers i

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
think is an excellent set uh

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,559
to help us all think about

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
what happens elsewhere what happens

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,200
outside of nato what can we all learn to

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
make sure we keep moving together

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,280
against the common threat

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
so i think really for myself this

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
morning i also want to say that i really

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,039
enjoyed the city tour last night i'm

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
sure some of us did as well

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
i think from looking at some of you with

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
the coffee this morning that some of the

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
city tours went on a bit longer which is

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,438
great

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,200
i of course was tucked up like a good

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
boy in bed at ten o'clock

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,720
but i also wanted to say the history of

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
the city here is fantastic and it

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,400
reminded me of a piece of history to do

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
with disruption of service and i wonder

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000
if anyone knows what was the first

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,720
nation state to prosecute a disruption

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
of service

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
event

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,119
anyone know

45
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
because it might surprise you

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
it was the british

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
it was my guys

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,759
and you might be expecting to hear some

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,759
of the usual suspects right but it's

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,040
actually the british

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
and if you think about how long ago it

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,520
was

53
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,399
it was actually 1914

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,040
1914 and i was being told this story by

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
philip ingram a great uh threat analyst

56
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
for cyber security some of you know

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
philip and he was reminding me that 1914

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
the strategic effort war was declared

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
and the very first act on the first

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
morning after midnight a steamer ship

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
sailed out into the english channel

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
it was a cable ship it dragged up the

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
cables and cut the cables so germany

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
lost all his communications with its

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
embassies and also the united states

66
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,959
so a disruption of service even people

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
thinking that about network disruption

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
back in 1914 so keeping moving forward

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
we now come to today and we've got a

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
rich history which perhaps goes back

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
further than we thought before even

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
electronics

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,800
so what i'm going to try and talk about

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
today is to try and get across some of

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
the best practices and the things that

76
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
we see in fortinet as a global player

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
and i'm sure the other speakers will

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
help us as well to see

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
what else is going on out there that we

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
can learn from today the good news is

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
i'm not going to be going into technical

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
you really don't want me to go into

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
technical i promise you because my

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
technical knowledge is not like the

85
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
experts on our stand and others but i

86
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
think we all want to talk about

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
capabilities and effects very nato good

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
ideals talk about capabilities and

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,959
effects

90
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,239
so let's have a

91
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
look first for those of you don't know

92
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
who we are fortinet there's no reason

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
why you should but we're a global player

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
we're now the largest cyber security

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,319
provider on the planet and we always

96
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
sell through partners so you perhaps

97
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
don't meet us direct all the time but i

98
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
think now we've earned our credibility

99
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
and the company has doubled in the last

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
two years as well

101
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
i think the market tends to speak for

102
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
itself our prime products being

103
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
firewalls but the market dominance there

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
globally is pretty strong to see

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
and i think that really comes from i

106
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,799
think we're being a trusted partner and

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
doing things like this today so we come

108
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
out and speak and see how we can help

109
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
and share best practice and as you go

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
through the talk today you'll see why

111
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
we also give things away as a lot at the

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
moment there's a skill shortage it's a

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
real big problem in the defence sector

114
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
but also a really big problem for nato

115
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,080
and all of us because the skills are

116
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
hard to retain and train at the moment i

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
saw an article this morning saying that

118
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,360
80 percent of people surveyed in it

119
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
industry are considering leaving the

120
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
industry which is a disaster so we've

121
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
got to look after our young so this

122
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
scheme here is to give free training and

123
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
fortinet has pledged to train a million

124
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
people for free in the world to try and

125
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
address the skills gap

126
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,439
and our competitors and colleagues as

127
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,920
well are doing the same it is not uh

128
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
just our problem is the in the whole

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
industry has to address this and we're

130
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,719
all doing our bit which is great to see

131
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,358
so the context for today i want to just

132
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
uh get across to you the pieces that i

133
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
think are important for us and there and

134
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
there they are

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
the key one is the first one and that

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,199
little

137
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
additional point i've made there

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
everything i see in health sector and

139
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
government sector and

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,639
transport sector the same problems exist

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
we mustn't worry we mustn't get too

142
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
stressed the same problems are there we

143
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
just got to share the ideas and really

144
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
change our mindsets and we'll talk about

145
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
about that later

146
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
i think also we

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
industry has been driving this process

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
and it was said yesterday brilliantly by

149
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,320
general paul nakasone about industry is

150
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
really driving this now full-on the

151
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
assistant secretary general also said

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,400
this

153
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
that

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
we shouldn't worry about like the cold

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,880
war we had to invent things the defense

156
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
base and since but we don't have to

157
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
invent a new attack helicopter here the

158
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
systems and technology is there already

159
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
we just got to know how to use it and

160
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
what systems to acquire and procure at

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
the right times

162
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,919
i think also you can see the scale of

163
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
the industry there it's an enormous

164
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,880
financial industry now so it's

165
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
attracting a lot of attention in

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,800
governments of course and its national

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
security level i think it was said well

168
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,199
yesterday that uh cyber security is now

169
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,960
national security and that was a great

170
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
uh quote yesterday

171
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,160
so it's a good time now i really think

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
for us this morning just to take a pause

173
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
as the mists clear from last night with

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
the coffee and just think about how do

175
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,919
we use some of this best practice to

176
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,960
help us

177
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
in the next

178
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,919
few years ahead which i think will be

179
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
quite decisive

180
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
so the first thing is to say how does

181
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,919
global cyber security work and it may be

182
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
a surprise to some of you to some of you

183
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
not but there's an awful lot going on

184
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
all the time every day a live conflict

185
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,319
all the time out there

186
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
and if we drill down into what this is

187
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
40 guard labs at fortinet the air the

188
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
biggest thing i have fortinet is because

189
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
we have over 500 000 users 6 million

190
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
devices shipped they're all over the

191
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,280
world so the largest threat attack

192
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
surface in the world

193
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
so fortnite are rather neatly turn this

194
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
into the largest surveillance network in

195
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
the world

196
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
it senses it all reports back everything

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
that they see that is bad and that comes

198
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
back to the central control positions

199
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
and then instantaneously if something's

200
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
bad it gets pushed out to be blocked on

201
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
every device and this is where true

202
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,520
integration like that will allow the

203
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
automated threat analysis to make sure

204
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
that we lever this data

205
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
so you can see all the time in this uh

206
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
particular feed here you can see live on

207
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
the fortiguard website it's an

208
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,199
interesting thing especially for your

209
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
junior staff to look at it's great to

210
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
see the u.s naval academy uh people here

211
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
but also anyone who's got young staff

212
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
who are interested in these things put

213
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
them in charge of it i always try and

214
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
give young staff something every month

215
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,720
to report back on something new they've

216
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
seen that's empower the young because

217
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
after all they are

218
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
the digital natives people of my

219
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
generation are digital migrants

220
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,479
so

221
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,919
we have to also remember that we're not

222
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
alone and every one of those pictures on

223
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
there are customers

224
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
but of ours but also the big one in the

225
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
middle the big big boys in the middle

226
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,960
they fund pretty much all the research

227
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
and development

228
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
the industry the financial services

229
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,319
industry is 27 trillion

230
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,840
and the defense sector spending

231
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
worldwide three trillion so we can see

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,319
again who's really pushing on with their

233
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
data security and they need true data

234
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
security because they're regulated they

235
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
get heavy fines heavy financial

236
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,599
penalties

237
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
so it's being driven there but all of

238
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
these people all the time

239
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
also can use and leverage

240
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
that experience

241
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
from that technology and just use it

242
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
it's almost mimicry it's almost

243
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
plagiarism but it doesn't matter because

244
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,919
it's a common shared toolset to be used

245
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,960
against a common threat

246
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,319
so i thought what we do is we look at

247
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,840
some of these new challenges which are

248
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,199
the same challenges remember what i said

249
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
for everybody else

250
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,759
we all know these positive green things

251
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
that are going on in our industry these

252
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,400
are good things things that have

253
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
happened where we're starting to get

254
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,199
some

255
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
positive things happening as the digital

256
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
era starts to evolve

257
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
but the bad guys they have a vote as

258
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,919
well they're watching this and they're

259
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,000
adapting and then like in any conflict

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
all the times they're keeping moving

261
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
we have to also

262
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
so they certainly see an enlarged attack

263
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
surface but also they're exploiting gaps

264
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,519
and certainly as people fall behind

265
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
and rather than keep moving people fall

266
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,519
behind that's normally because people

267
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,120
haven't necessarily kept up to date with

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
the technology that's out there i think

269
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,000
also the lack of threat automation sorry

270
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
the threat automation coming at us

271
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
is quite remarkable i was speaking to

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
the people in charge of fortiguard labs

273
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
in north america and we'll all remember

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the log 4j incident

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
it was 84 minutes after the log4j

276
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
publication of what was going on was

277
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
released out there 84 minutes later

278
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
automated threats started being

279
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
monitored by fortiguard labs

280
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
normally typically it would take a few

281
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
days for that to filter through

282
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
so this is truly automated systems

283
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
coming at us

284
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
we have to keep moving we have to match

285
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
it

286
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,839
and the biggest problem we've got and

287
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
especially in the defence sector and

288
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
it's not necessarily just the defense

289
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
sector health particularly challenged at

290
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
the moment across europe

291
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,959
is the

292
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,000
the threat

293
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
against the legacy estates

294
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
and people say often how can we do this

295
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
we can't throw everything away well you

296
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
can evolve and adapt and most of the

297
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
industry have good connectability our

298
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,440
systems connect to everything so you can

299
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
keep effectively improving your car

300
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
without having to change the whole car

301
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,519
you can keep upgrading and improving

302
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
your systems

303
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,360
we must keep moving

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
so how can we accelerate this change

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
what ideas have we got where from what

306
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,720
i've seen and also what might be useful

307
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
for us this morning across the world

308
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,720
other high-risk sectors i've been

309
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
fortunate enough to

310
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
have roles in oil and gas and

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
construction and government military but

312
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
actually the military is of course a

313
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
very high-risk sector because of the

314
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
physical risk and now the digital risk

315
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
but of course there are others and we

316
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,079
only have to think of banking and other

317
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,480
sectors like that education particularly

318
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
high risk at the moment because of

319
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
course the amount of research going on

320
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
through the pandemic times has meant

321
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
that this disruption going on there in

322
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
large numbers

323
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
so i thought it'd be useful to share

324
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
just three points from a lot of the csos

325
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
i get to speak to it's a great privilege

326
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
i have for speaking to some of the

327
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
greatest minds

328
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
very busy people often quite tired

329
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
people which is a concern to me and to

330
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,399
you

331
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
um overwork

332
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
um what do they say

333
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,079
the real thing is to try and take away

334
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
their advantage now this is a military

335
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,120
philosophy isn't it you've got to try

336
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,959
and it's sun tzu stuff we've got to try

337
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,440
and out maneuver and out think the enemy

338
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
but that stealth and speed let's try and

339
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
keep moving and keep moving ahead

340
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
and also use that big data it's our data

341
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
our advantage so you can see how that

342
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
system i showed you the threat analysis

343
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
allows us to map and work out and share

344
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
which i'll talk about in a minute that

345
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
threat data and how that can maximize

346
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,240
the world's

347
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
combating literally of the threat

348
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
and automation it was really

349
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
important that we today go away we know

350
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
that automation is there because the

351
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
threat is automated now we have to make

352
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
sure we get automation

353
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
and it was our founder who was at the

354
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
world economic forum a couple of years

355
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
ago speaking and he reminded everyone

356
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
that you can't get automation unless you

357
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
have integration

358
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
no automation unless there's integration

359
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
so we have to think about how do we get

360
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
our systems integrated

361
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
so the new technology and remember this

362
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,279
is not designed as a deep dive into

363
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,800
technology let's look at some of the

364
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
capabilities

365
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
now in terms of fortinet stuff it's

366
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,399
pretty straightforward we divide it into

367
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
various stacks and your security stack

368
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,839
whatever organization you're in will be

369
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,160
in various components but the key bit is

370
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
to make sure it feeds into one central

371
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
management center that has com less

372
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
complexity and more simplicity we call

373
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,240
that security fabric and some of you'll

374
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
be familiar with that and our single

375
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,839
pane of glass approach allows a very

376
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,920
junior employee to be able to see

377
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
complete visibility and adept adapt and

378
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
respond accordingly

379
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,440
but i want to really just talk for a few

380
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
moments about secure sd-wan

381
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
i'm calling it the game changer because

382
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
it is

383
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,360
secure sd-wan is a game changer and

384
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
certainly is game changing in the

385
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
high-risk sectors outside especially

386
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
banking and sd branch and if those terms

387
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,079
if you're not familiar with sd-wan

388
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
please do go and ask at the stand

389
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
yesterday it was really nice to see

390
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
people coming forward and asking the

391
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
same questions that i do of my technical

392
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,600
staff say

393
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
how does that work i don't really

394
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
understand it and that's a really

395
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
important thing for you to do while

396
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
you're here the other standards some

397
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
great stands around just ask them about

398
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
stuff and just take a coffee because

399
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
people have come here to help you learn

400
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
and understand it's a centre of

401
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,959
excellence

402
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,160
but the most important thing about

403
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
secure sd-wan is effectively it's a

404
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
security overlay on any bearer system

405
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
and so the security system becomes the

406
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
network it's almost starting to flip now

407
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
so try and get our minds around that

408
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
because the big advantage for military

409
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
is this

410
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
is that we can send over one bearer

411
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,320
system

412
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
multiple levels of classification

413
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
and all you have to do that can be

414
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,200
accredited with the right segmentation

415
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
that is the game changer because you

416
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
think about the complexity

417
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
that we have in nato and in other

418
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
defense forces where we have different

419
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,079
systems i remember as a nato chief of

420
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
staff in kosovo i had three different

421
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
computer screens and three different

422
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
computers on my desk i had to add room

423
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
for my notebook you know it was just

424
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
really difficult i still use a notebook

425
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,240
okay so the fact is that we have to try

426
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
and think about how we can reduce that

427
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,599
complexity a bit of flick around

428
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,720
actionable threat intelligence it was

429
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
something that the nato people have

430
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
asked us to speak about and i know some

431
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,959
of the people at the headquarters at

432
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
shape have asked our team there to talk

433
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
a bit about

434
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
we have to keep moving because they're

435
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,959
moving fast we have to make sure we keep

436
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,720
ahead and

437
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,880
to make sure we have that we can operate

438
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
at the speed of light at digital speed

439
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,399
to combat that threat very quickly

440
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
remember the 84 minutes story from 40

441
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
guard labs

442
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
and that system there for example that

443
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,839
picture is a military deployed system

444
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,800
it's from

445
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,160
one of our partners pro-link's a

446
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
uk-based system and they effectively

447
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
have a man portable system that boxes

448
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
underneath the laptop there provide all

449
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,480
the secure connections which is sd-wan

450
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,959
secure sd-wan built into a 40-gate and

451
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
it's just an example just one example of

452
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
how systems are moving on and being

453
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,199
acquired quite rapidly so they can

454
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
enhance technology and enhance the

455
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
safety of all our data

456
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
and we remember when we saw this picture

457
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
and we saw it moving a few minutes ago

458
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,959
last year burnt coney and i from

459
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
fortinet we spoke on the workshop and we

460
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,399
talked about the common operational

461
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
picture and for years in the military

462
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
we're always trying to find this common

463
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,839
operational picture it's become like the

464
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
holy grail how can we try and find it

465
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
the reality is it's there all the time

466
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
in the industry we do it we do the

467
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,959
common operational picture because we

468
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,720
have to we have to share all that threat

469
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
data around

470
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
but it's not just for us

471
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,320
quite a few years ago our founder and

472
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
several other key people in the industry

473
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
and several other large companies our

474
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,759
competitors and allies and colleagues

475
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,199
all got together and formed a thing

476
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,040
called cta some of you may know about it

477
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,959
but if you don't the cyber threat

478
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,240
alliance

479
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,839
based out of the united states this

480
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,480
fused together and shared all the threat

481
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
intelligence of the prime concerned

482
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
threat intelligence with each other so

483
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
the industry became became tighter

484
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
but also with the agencies and if you

485
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
think about it how else can any

486
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,839
government any military

487
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,360
obtain this data

488
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,839
it's in our systems so it has to be

489
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
shared so this sharing system this

490
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
public-private partnership that was

491
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
talked about yesterday by the assistant

492
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
secretary general has already been going

493
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,160
on

494
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
mostly invisible and it's an open

495
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
website you can go and look at cta and

496
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
do have a look at it it's a very

497
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,240
interesting

498
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
ideal but this sharing of information

499
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
means that we're all safer because it

500
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
keeps us all ahead of the threat all

501
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
integrated

502
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,079
but also in terms of the systems that

503
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
are happening now we're going from

504
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,480
really the

505
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
point systems on the on the left hand

506
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,279
side there point products

507
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,320
now moving across into the future to

508
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
form into a more integrated system

509
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
and gartner have come out

510
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,680
ended last year we're talking about this

511
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
is the cyber security mesh architecture

512
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
csma and you'll see a lot of that in the

513
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
next few years

514
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
the mesh it's much easier for us to

515
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
understand the mesh yeah like a weave or

516
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,759
like a fabric and fortinet have been

517
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
doing this for some time

518
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
so our fortinet security fabric does

519
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,480
this and shares those ideals and that's

520
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,759
where we think the industry will go

521
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
we've been doing it for about 10 years

522
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,120
gartner says this is where we have to go

523
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
now because that integration of all

524
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
products talking to each other all the

525
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,880
time

526
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
sharing information tightening that

527
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
fabric is the way to go

528
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
we've also been asked by our friends at

529
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
nato to talk about

530
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
zero trust now i don't know about you i

531
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
don't like the word

532
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,679
because zero trust we've had a lot of

533
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,599
people come back to us and say

534
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,799
it it implies that it sounds like you

535
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
don't trust your own staff which is a

536
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
terrible thing if you're a leader or a

537
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
manager but of course the reality is

538
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
it's not so much that

539
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
but there is an insider risk and if

540
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,320
we're in high-risk sectors we have to

541
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
worry about that

542
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
and it was great to hear one of the

543
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
students from the united states naval

544
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
academy tell me about trust with verify

545
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
a much more

546
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
practical industry term trust with

547
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
verify or reality

548
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,080
just verify constant verification so for

549
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
those who are not familiar with it i

550
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
know most people are effectively it's

551
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
the electronic roving sentry someone

552
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
coming around we're being checked

553
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,640
outside to make sure we got things like

554
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
passes and badges as we come in

555
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,000
but also

556
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
to make sure that for us

557
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,799
that

558
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
these systems are built in and we've

559
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
built them into our prime products now

560
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
because people want that and everyone

561
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
will start to do this absolutely right

562
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
so zero trust the whole principle it's a

563
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
philosophy not a particular product it's

564
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,320
a way of operating that effectively says

565
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
i'm just going to ask you for your

566
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
identity automatically if need be but

567
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,799
quite regularly

568
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,480
what about deception technology this is

569
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
something that always excites the

570
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,840
military audience because we like that

571
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
deception and concealment is a principle

572
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
of military defense operations and we're

573
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
part of a defense operation and if

574
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
you're in nature you've got various

575
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,240
deception techniques to ensnare and

576
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,039
entrap your enemy but also in military

577
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,400
historically and currently have

578
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,679
different deception techniques and

579
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
camouflage and concealment so why not

580
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
why not start using the psychology back

581
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,919
to what we said earlier let's start

582
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,160
levering the data that start taking the

583
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
fight to them let's make it really hard

584
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,919
for them deception technology is

585
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,720
fantastic for this so one example

586
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
of deception technology is where you

587
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
have

588
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,919
an advanced early warning system that

589
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,640
basically shows you that uh someone's in

590
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,039
your location because they think they're

591
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
in your folder set

592
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
that they're not they're actually in a

593
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
replicated folder set where the folders

594
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
are effectively empty they're hunting

595
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
round and you can then be alerting your

596
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,919
staff automatically 24 7 that

597
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
something's going on they're also being

598
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,799
segmented and trapped themselves but

599
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
also if it isn't inside a threat you can

600
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
see where it's coming from and make sure

601
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
you can close this down

602
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
so it actually also helps especially

603
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
with our sensitive documents people

604
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,080
inside just having a bit of a dabble now

605
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
i think all of us if we all search our

606
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
souls have probably thought a bit

607
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,679
temptation sometimes on a big shared

608
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
folder dive to have a

609
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
little look around and that's the sort

610
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,039
of technology that will prevent this

611
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,840
happening because it would be

612
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,760
unprofessional but also it would break

613
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,000
classified rules

614
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
so quite a lot of technology there but

615
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
let's talk about the mindsets this is

616
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,640
the thing i really want to try and get

617
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
across today how do we actually change

618
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
mindsets how do we try and get our

619
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,679
approach to change

620
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
other high-risk sectors are doing it so

621
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
let's look at an example of how a bank

622
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
would work i always say to people if

623
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,320
people are worried and concerned in the

624
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
defense sector i said don't get too

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
worried just look at how the big banks

626
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
do it now fortinet are very fortunate we

627
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,039
secure about 70 to the ftse 100 so a lot

628
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
of those large organizations are secured

629
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,159
so we speak to them and talk to them all

630
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
the time but actually they go about it

631
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
in quite a professional approach and

632
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,440
there's an example

633
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
but focus on number five

634
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
and wonder how many times that we're

635
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
guilty of just going straight to number

636
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
five

637
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
public sector often

638
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
a bit of a bit of a challenge because

639
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
the ones above

640
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
need quite a lot of work

641
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
and everyone's busy everyone's every

642
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
busy in their day job

643
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,679
get more automated they'll be less busy

644
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,520
more time for this of course but i think

645
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
you just want to focus especially the

646
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
ones i've put in bold making sure people

647
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
are coming in and showcasing the new

648
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
technology some incredible stuff going

649
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
on with data management systems at the

650
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
moment outside the security estate as

651
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
well and therefore i think that sort of

652
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
looking around having a quick check

653
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,400
should almost be the same as we would

654
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
use reconnaissance in the military sense

655
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,000
make sure we're looking around that's a

656
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
big common common fault and moore's law

657
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
we know is going to keep moving so we've

658
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
got to keep moving same as the

659
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
conference tells us to

660
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,360
so about public sector though because

661
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
surely it's easy with a bank right

662
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
because it's a bank's got lots of money

663
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
and we have a tighter budget but here's

664
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
an example a live example of something

665
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,919
that happened recently with a major

666
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,280
government department in european

667
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,400
country very very large 70 000 uses live

668
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,679
operations

669
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
and just look at that process and follow

670
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
it through

671
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
as to how it evolved

672
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
and it works

673
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,480
and people like ourselves will put in a

674
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
lot of staff to make sure it all goes

675
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
through smoothly and then the system

676
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,760
runs on

677
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,120
the useful thing for this government

678
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,200
department like they often find is it's

679
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,039
a cost saving because nothing to say

680
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
that by constructing your technology

681
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
choices you're also constricting

682
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
potentially commercial options so

683
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
there's a really interesting part there

684
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,799
with government and other bodies a lot

685
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
of vendors like ourselves

686
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
are looking to do longer term models

687
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
which save up to 50 percent of the

688
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
outlay cost

689
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,760
now

690
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,960
people in the room may not be too

691
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
impressed about that and say okay not my

692
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
bag

693
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
i bet this chief financial officers and

694
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,159
the ultimately the nato member countries

695
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,919
would be very glad as well so we all

696
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,200
have a duty to keep looking around at

697
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
good value where we can

698
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
so really to summarize and just sort of

699
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,320
bring this together i've put together

700
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,400
what i think are five takeaways for for

701
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
us all to keep moving this morning to

702
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
make sure these bold mindsets can be

703
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
applied to this new technology that's

704
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
happening

705
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
i think really we've got to remember

706
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,919
that the

707
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,159
the technology and the way that things

708
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,600
are moving now

709
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
means that

710
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
we have to ensure that we are always

711
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
ahead of the game we have to keep moving

712
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,080
there's never been a better time now

713
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
to do exactly what we're doing today

714
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
you've taken your time to come to this

715
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
conference you're looking around you're

716
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
thinking you didn't sit at home you

717
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,400
decided to come here so you've already

718
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
made that leap so we must make sure we

719
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
encourage others around us to just take

720
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
time

721
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,039
i always used to encourage in all our

722
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
departments every month to make sure we

723
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
had one hour a bit like google taught us

724
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
to do to sit around and brainstorm and

725
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,280
just work out especially let's get the

726
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,799
youngsters doing it they're very well

727
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,240
informed and they like that it's

728
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,559
retention positive and often they come

729
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
out with some terrific ideas

730
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,919
but also

731
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,200
to make sure the next generation

732
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
technology being there operating all the

733
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
time every day especially on the

734
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
difficult ones like christmas and new

735
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
year the times when we know the threat

736
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
goes up and people come at us

737
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
i think we have to deal with ever

738
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
complex threats all the time

739
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
so it's already happening let's not

740
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
worry i mean that about the technology

741
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
technology remember the banking industry

742
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
is is driving on we've said about how

743
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,039
the mesh

744
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,640
and actionable threat intelligence this

745
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,520
integrated moving data around taking the

746
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,960
fight to the enemy maximizing and

747
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
leveraging our data

748
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
exactly what we're trying to achieve in

749
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
common operational picture and all the

750
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
advantages of digitization in the

751
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,720
military sphere

752
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
i think also we need to remember that

753
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
the people and processes are the things

754
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,559
we really want to study and look at and

755
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,679
what i've said about some of those best

756
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
practices and perhaps best practice

757
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,480
discussions in all of our operations and

758
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
headquarters we work in would be a good

759
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,760
idea

760
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,279
and lastly i think really the real

761
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,200
important thing is to ask

762
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,279
and i just get people to come and talk

763
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,039
and present there's no no shame in that

764
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,320
at all i think often people think what

765
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
they're expected to know everything

766
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
i have to get my staff training every

767
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,760
week for at least one hour to keep up

768
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,840
with the company's technology we have

769
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
more technology patents than anyone all

770
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,880
the industry put together we have an

771
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
enormous amount of technology developing

772
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
all the time so if i have to tell my

773
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
staff to train how can i expect our

774
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
customers to be doing that we we serve

775
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,159
the customers so just ring up the

776
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,480
various vendors there's a few great

777
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,159
technology companies out there get

778
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,240
people to come in and help you with it

779
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
but whatever happens

780
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,080
we all know that if the threats moving

781
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
faster

782
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,400
we have to as well and we have to keep

783
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,159
moving

784
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,480
thank you

785
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,919
it's uh

786
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,760
a few moments left and if anyone's got a

787
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
i can hardly see anything here with

788
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
these lights but if anyone's got any

789
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
burning questions i'm happy to take

790
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,840
a question should anyone have that

791
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,159
no that's great well i look forward to

792
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,760
chatting to you afterwards as well but

793
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
thank you for again for the center of

794
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
excellence here putting on a great event

795
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,039
and we look forward to seeing you

796
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
tonight at the dinner as well thanks

797
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
very much thank you chris please

798
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,970
standing

799
