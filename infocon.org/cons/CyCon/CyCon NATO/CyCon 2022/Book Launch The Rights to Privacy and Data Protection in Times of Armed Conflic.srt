1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
hello good evening

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,280
um

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,160
my name is ann valedaga and

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,080
i am a legal researcher here at the

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
ccdcoe

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
and today i'm extremely honored to

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
welcome you all to

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
a book launch a very special book launch

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
at least for me

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
because um

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
it seems like we are opening up

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
a door to

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,640
kind of

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
undeservedly underexplored territory

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,840
due to my

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,719
digital rights advocacy background i

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
have been

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,800
i have been delegated to rewarding a

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
challenging task of lecturing

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,039
human rights

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
to

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,440
auditory of predominantly

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
military background during our

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
international

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
law has applied to cyber operations

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,120
course

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
and

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
after a year

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
of having

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
more or less regularly fulfilled its

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
duty i discovered that why do i always

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
stop when

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
international humanitarian law

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
kicks in when in the hypothetical

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
scenarios a real armed conflict

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
has broken out and

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,439
the magical spell of leg specialis has

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,320
been whispered why do i always stop and

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
why do i kind of intuitively presume

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
that this is the time where a human

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
rights law

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
steps aside

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
because when talking about like

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
specialists then at least when it comes

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
to digital rights there is not much

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,960
specific

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
in the presumed like specialist

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
so i went searching high and low for

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
answers

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
not many were relieved revealed during

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,040
this

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
little query of mine but

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
except for one valuable source

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
azov lubin who previously had

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
contributed to

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
cycling proceedings in 2018

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
had just written a draft exploring the

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,879
rights to privacy and data protection in

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
armed conflict

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
so

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
i contacted him and

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
we decided to add in the missing

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
ingredients in the form

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,200
of

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
of uh

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,760
russell bogdan's expertise in

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,040
uh international law and cyber espionage

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,319
and um wide array of uh

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
in-depth knowledge of our wonderful

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
co-authors or

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
the authors of the chapters there and i

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,319
think that we understood that we in fact

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
have a very good formula for exploring

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,519
this

75
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,599
unmapped territory

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
so

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
whether or not

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
a reader chooses to agree with the

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
arguments and conclusions

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,159
presented between the covers of the book

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,360
i think that we have succeeded when it

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
inspires you to think why do we assume

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
that human rights

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
law applies or

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
or

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
alternatively does not apply or is it a

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
black and white case of absolutes is

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
there a gray area and what are the

89
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
components of this gray area

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
so

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,519
on this note i'm happy to

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
hand it over to our editors the editors

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,799
of the

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,879
freshly published anthology of lubin and

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
russell bargain so that they can

96
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
introduce the very distinguished panel

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
of discussions that we have thank you

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
so the way russell and i we're going to

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,080
keep our presentation for you because

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
we're really interested in hearing uh

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
the comments of uh our esteemed

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
colleagues who have read the book and

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
are offering feedback the way we thought

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
of introducing the book to you which we

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,159
hope you grabbed your own free copy

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,000
because there's nothing better than ccd

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
siri conferences than bringing home

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,399
copies of books with you

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
is that i'll introduce the general

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
framework about why the topic is of

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
importance and then

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,240
russell will take on the daunting

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
challenging of mapping out the way the

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
book is structured and laid out

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,960
um

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
and so as was mentioned i wrote a book

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
chapter for another book on the

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
concurrent application of human rights

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
foreign eye chair back in 2018 2019

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
uh and at the time when i was writing my

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
own book chapter on the topic there was

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
nothing out there to build the theory

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
around

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
and just to highlight to you why there

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
is nothing out there it's partially

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
because of the laziness of our

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
international institutions and trying to

128
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,960
set out

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
how the law applies in this space here

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
here's two examples the icj wall

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
advisory opinion in 2004 acknowledged

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
that article 17 of the iccpr on the

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
right to privacy quote applied in the

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
occupied palestinian territory but the

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
court did not however go further in

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
clarifying why it applied or in what

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
fashion it applied what specific

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
consequence this such application had on

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
the issues before it

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,560
similarly a recently updated commentary

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
to the second geneva convention produced

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
by the icrc discussed the communication

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
of personal health data by hospital

144
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
ships

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
during armed conflict the commentary

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,600
noted that such data was quote must be

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,320
afforded a reasonable level of security

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
as sources for this claim the icrc cites

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
international privacy and data

150
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
protection standards

151
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
wherever those standards exist and apply

152
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
much like the icj the icfc stops short

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
of actually clarifying when such

154
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
standards apply what theory grounds

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
their application what is their exact

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,840
meaning would be in a particular

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
circumstance say in the context of

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
health data

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
and so when we created the idea behind

160
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
this book we hope that our contributing

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
authors will step in and fill some of

162
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,039
that void and that is a real challenge

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,000
in conceptualizing the new frontiers of

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
human rights at the concurrent and their

165
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,080
concurrent application ihl in a digital

166
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,919
rights environment

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
just to situate us let me give you one

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
example i use chapter 7 from the book

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
by leah west

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
she describes in that chapter the

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,759
withdrawal of the us from afghanistan

172
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,440
and she says following the american

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
ritual from afghanistan august 2021

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
taliban forces moved through the country

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
quickly claiming control of not only

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
villages but also the arms and military

177
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
equipment left behind by u.s forces

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
also left behind were devices known as

179
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
handheld interagency detection equipment

180
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
or h-i-d-e used to collect store and up

181
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
owed biometric information collected

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
from individuals in the field

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
in afghanistan information collected by

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
hides included personals facial

185
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,479
photographs ira scans fingerprints and

186
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,720
biographical information

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
and then she concludes a little is known

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
about what if any safeguards were in

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
place to ensure the data collected by

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
coalition forces remaining on the

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
devices or shared with the afghan

192
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,120
government could not be accessed or

193
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
leveraged by the taliban or other

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
malicious actors to target civilians

195
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
once again u.s forces appear to ignore

196
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
the privacy interest of the afghans for

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,160
the sake of operational expediency

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
and as we move from the situation

199
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
afghanistan we might think about the use

200
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
of cctv cameras in a.i by israel in the

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,319
context of the occupied palestinian

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,039
territories or the use of particular

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,160
mobile applications in the context of

204
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
running their checkpoints in the west

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
bank and the gaza strip or you might

206
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
think about um more recently in the

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,599
context of russia ukraine uh the release

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,400
on social media of particular videos of

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
russian and ukrainian detainees um in

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
ways that might impact their privacy and

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
in particular the obligation to treat

212
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
them humanely so again the

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
intersectionality between traditional

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
ihl rules and the application of

215
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
contemporary human rights comes into

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
play and that is at the heart of what

217
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
the book strives to lays out it adds to

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
the complication that on top of the

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
traditional right to privacy there is

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,719
yet another more emerging and complex

221
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
right to data protection and so part of

222
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,760
our design of this panel today is that

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,159
we have a speaker to look at one of each

224
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
of these issues ihl human rights law and

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
data protection with that i'll stop

226
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
talking and move it on to this well

227
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
thank you very much as azav for that

228
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
introduction and yes just to reiterate

229
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
that the protection of the rights uh to

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
privacy and armed conflicts and indeed

231
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
uh data protection in armed conflict

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
more generally is an important an under

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
research topic and we believe that the

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,920
book uh would be of broad interest and

235
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,399
appeal to researchers practitioners

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,240
policymakers and other stakeholders

237
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,760
working across the disciplines of

238
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
technology human rights international

239
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
law international relations and other

240
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
disciplines just give me a few moments

241
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
just to say a few words about the

242
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
content of the book to give an overview

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,040
of its various sections and chapters the

244
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
book is of course available for you uh

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
here and is available open access online

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,279
um

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
but perhaps for the benefit of those

248
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
have not had a look yet just just let me

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
give a brief overview the book is split

250
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
into four sections which cut across

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
different themes section one explores

252
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
the extent to which various regimes of

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
international humanitarian law protect

254
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
the rights to digital privacy and data

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
protection

256
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
in the first chapter chapter one uh mary

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,680
ellen o'connell advances the argument

258
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
that the protection afforded by

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
international law to personal data is

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
the same during times of armed conflict

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
as it is during times of peace

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
in chapter two tal miran and yuval

263
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
shaini zero in on the weapons review

264
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
obligation contained in article 36 of

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
additional protocol 1 arguing that this

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
provision requires state parties to

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
integrate privacy concerns into their

268
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
evaluation of new technologies such as

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
cyber weapons autonomous weapons and the

270
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
human enhancement of soldiers

271
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
in chapter three lori blanc and eric

272
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
talbot jensen examine the extent to

273
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,480
which international humanitarian law

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
covers the caesar seizure requisition

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
and destruction of data during times of

276
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
armed conflict

277
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
chapter four jacqueline vandeveld

278
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,440
assesses the extent to which the law of

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,839
neutrality requires neutral states to

280
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
monitor and prevent companies located

281
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,519
within their jurisdictions from

282
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,680
transferring data to parties to armed

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,959
conflicts in breach of the rights to

284
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,680
privacy and data protection

285
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
in chapter four omar shahabi explores

286
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
how the law of occupation and in

287
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
particular the obligations imposed upon

288
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
occupying powers can be progressively

289
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
interpreted or reinterpreted to protect

290
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
digital privacy and in chapter six emily

291
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
crawford examines the privacy related

292
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,920
rights of prisoners of war in the

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
digital age and in particular identifies

294
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
the types of data that detaining powers

295
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
can collect from prisoners of war which

296
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,600
strikes me as a particularly important

297
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
topic in light of the conflict in

298
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,040

this practice chapter 9 tara davenport

314
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
examines a really interesting

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
issue she identifies and analyzes the

316
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
international legal rules that apply

317
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,959
where parties to armed conflicts

318
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,680
intercept and collect data stored on or

yourself hello thank you for the chapter

338
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
in your chapter you focus on data

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,839
their armed forces in chapter seven azaf

345
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
as luin examines the obligations of

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
international organizations to protect

347
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
data in the context of their

348
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
humanitarian actions and uses the icrc

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
as a case study so this brings me to the

350
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,279
final section section four which

351
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
analyzes the protection of digital

352
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
privacy rights in the used post bellum

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
this section begins with chapter 13 by

354
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
christina hellwig and this examines the

355
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,160
role of the right to privacy in the

356
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
investigation and prosecution of

357
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,959
international crimes and focus in

358
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880
particular on the rules and procedures

359
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
of the international criminal court but

360
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
actually it also cuts across uh the work

361
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
of other international criminal

362
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,240
tribunals in chapter 14 yale ronan

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
considers the right to be forgotten that

364
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
is the right of individuals to have

365
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
digitalized personal information removed

366
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
from the public sphere and especially

367
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
when it's linked to criminal activities

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
and finally the final chapter chapter 15

369
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,160
amir khan proposes a right not to be

370
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
forgotten which in order to protect

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,480
digital identities identities would

372
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
place a moratorium on private tech

373
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
companies preventing them from denying

374
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
individuals caught up in humanitarian

375
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,279
crises access to their online accounts

376
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
so that's the full

377
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,839
book um and we're delighted as as i've

378
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,600
said um that three

379
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
distinguished commentators have agreed

380
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,399
to lend their expertise and their their

381
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
time uh to discuss the book um and i'll

382
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
just introduce them very briefly because

383
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
of course i'm sure they're all well

384
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
known to you but their biographies are

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,720

412
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
a pleasure to be here

413
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,040
and to speak about this really

414
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,279
interesting intriguing book

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
and it is that i'm not just saying it

416
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,880
because it's what's supposed to be said

417
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
at book launches it is a genuinely

418
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,320
interesting

419
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
novel book

420
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,279
um

421
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
so assaf said

422
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
there was a gap in the literature

423
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
you know nobody really explored this

424
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
and you sort of gave some reasons for

425
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
why that's the case

426
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
to to the reasons you gave i would also

427
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,920
add one until relatively recently

428
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,639
everybody would think you were crazy

429
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,160
if you're writing about the right to

430
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
privacy and data protection in our

431
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
conflict

432
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
it's like science fiction

433
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,639
right

434
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
how on earth are you supposed to talk

435
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,480
about privacy

436
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
in war

437
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
people are dying in war

438
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
right when there's smell of death sort

439
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,480
of in the air

440
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,279
who cares about privacy if the ukrainian

441
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,360
soldiers in the trenches

442
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
do they have privacy you know

443
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
so in in some ways it's a sort of

444
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
bizarre topic

445
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
but actually

446
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
it works

447
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
and it is important

448
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,560
cyber in the cyber strictly cyber

449
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
context

450
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
or not

451
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,359
and in fact i think you really

452
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,919
uh you know uncovered or or started

453
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,039
exploring

454
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
a really important really interesting

455
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
set of issues

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,439
and even though there are more important

457
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
things more important considerations in

458
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,599
war probably than privacy

459
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,480
that doesn't mean there is no worth

460
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
to privacy in war

461
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,839
or that we as human beings who

462
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
are endowed with human rights simply by

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
virtue of being human

464
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,320
lose the right to private life

465
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
simply because two states or a state and

466
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
a non-state actor

467
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
choose to engage in armed conflict

468
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,280
so it's a really important topic

469
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
nobody has dealt with it

470
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,760
before

471
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,679
just to add sort of to the sense of

472
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,039
importance of the topic

473
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,720
think about what's going on in ukraine

474
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,039
right now

475
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
so think about all the normal regular

476
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
people of ukraine

477
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
who are suffering some harm to their

478
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
privacy interests

479
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,840
as a result of russian cyber attacks

480
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
which are probably not happening to the

481
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,559
extent we most you know anticipate most

482
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,280
of us anticipate are still happening

483
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,919
but think specifically about those

484
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
people of ukraine

485
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
who have the misfortune

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
of finding themselves under russia's

487
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
occupation

488
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
and think if you live in here son right

489
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,039
now

490
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,559
of the various measures of surveillance

491
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,399
that russia is imposing on you

492
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
okay

493
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
if you're a ukrainian prisoner of war

494
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
and there are now thousands of ukraine

495
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
prisoners of war in russia's hands

496
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
after azov stall fell

497
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
again consider

498
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
not just the basic humane treatment

499
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
dignity obligations that the icrc would

500
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
always insist on

501
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
but think for example about how russia

502
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
is inevitably

503
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,360
taking biometric data taking dna samples

504
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,679
taking photographics uh material of all

505
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
those individuals think about their

506
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,679
medical records

507
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,480
we can't just say

508
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
this stuff is trivial this stuff is

509
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
irrelevant it is peripheral to the real

510
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,240
you know issues of fighting a war

511
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,679
so

512
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,200
the key point that i will make here

513
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
is the following

514
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
human rights law

515
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
cares about the interests of individuals

516
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
as such

517
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,000
not about the rights of the state that

518
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
may have been infringed

519
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,280
so when we discuss ihl and other rules

520
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
of international law

521
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
in for example example in the context of

522
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
ukraine

523
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
we would be focusing on the rights of

524
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
ukraine as a state

525
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
but human rights law is different and

526
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,320
provides a very different perspective

527
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,480
it's about the rights of some poor guy

528
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
you know who is now in the hands of

529
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,159
russian soldiers

530
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
or of the regular individual on the

531
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,559
streets of hairson who is now being

532
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,480
surveilled wherever they go

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
it is the interest in the rights of that

534
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,880
individual that human rights law

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,960
uniquely as a path part of international

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,240
law really takes cognizance of and that

537
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
we need to integrate

538
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
in thinking about how human rights how

539
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,919
uh

540
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
fighting wars in the digital age should

541
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,440
be

542
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,039
regulated

543
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,080
okay so that that's sort of my pitch for

544
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
their book

545
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,159
in the sense that all i think

546
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,960
war fighters and cyber operators

547
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,919
who care about the respect of human

548
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,880
dignity and individual rights

549
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
they need to think about privacy in

550
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,240
particular and they need to buy their

551
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
book well get it for free online and

552
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
read it

553
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,120
to sort of start opening you know their

554
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,320
minds to issues they probably never

555
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
thought of

556
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
and i think that's a really good thing

557
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,919
now the second point that i would make

558
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,679
is that this is a really important case

559
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,280
study

560
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
generally from the standpoint of

561
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
conceptualizing the relationship with

562
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
human rights and ihl

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,120
you know the classical sort of lex

564
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
specialist trope

565
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,880
really breaks down here completely

566
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
ann was i think overly generous

567
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,840
in her assessment of how exactly many

568
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,039
special rules of ihl they found

569
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
that deal with privacy there are really

570
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
none

571
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
there are rules of ihl

572
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,480
that could be stretched a bit

573
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
so that they could fall within the scope

574
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
of what we would regard as the human

575
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,840
right to privacy

576
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
but when written they were not

577
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
conceptualized as such

578
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
when for example article

579
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,799
article 13 paragraph 7 of gc3

580
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,039
prohibited the exposure of pw's to

581
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
public curiosity

582
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
this wasn't written

583
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
with the idea of predicting the

584
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
individual privacy

585
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,159
of the prisoners of war

586
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
so even though there's some overlap

587
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,480
between these rules

588
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
it is impossible

589
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
in this particular context

590
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
to say

591
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,280
ihl is special it overwrites human

592
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
rights

593
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,600
there is simply no content

594
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,320
to the ihl of privacy that could

595
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
override human rights law

596
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,799
just like for example ihl says nothing

597
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,760
about the freedom of speech

598
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,159
in occupied territory

599
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,640
the only thing we can do

600
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,000
is interpret and apply human rights law

601
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
in a feasible realistic way

602
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
taking into account

603
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
the extraordinary circumstances

604
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
that are much farther from normalcy than

605
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,200
that you would want them to be

606
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,799
so that they can have some kind of

607
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
effective meaning

608
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,600
in armed conflict and this is what it's

609
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
like with a lot of other human rights as

610
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
well think for example the vast array of

611
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
socio-economic rights that again do not

612
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,919
have

613
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,400
any kind of clear equivalent

614
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
in in in ihl

615
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
so let me now very briefly talk about

616
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
the five most interesting challenges i

617
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
think well at least that i find

618
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,039
interesting

619
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
um from the uh

620
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
right to privacy in armed conflict

621
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
standpoint that are

622
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
you know to a large extent dealt with in

623
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,200
the book

624
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
the first is generally about gathering

625
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,720
intelligence

626
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
specifically

627
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,200
when we gather or when when militaries

628
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,159
gather intelligence not simply by

629
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,200
hacking the adversary state getting

630
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
their military plans or technologies or

631
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
anything like that but are actually

632
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,320
employing technologies that target

633
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,240
individuals

634
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,600
either

635
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,919
you know the specific person

636
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,880
or

637
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,120
through bulk or mass collection of

638
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,440
information this is as you know a huge

639
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
issue in peace time as well

640
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
and there has been very recent guidance

641
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
from human rights bodies on it

642
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
some of it is discussed in the book

643
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
the most prominent as you know decision

644
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,360
is the big brother watch judgment

645
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,000
of the uh of the european court of uh

646
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
human rights

647
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,919
now the european court has taken

648
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,159
a relatively modest

649
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
proceduralist approach

650
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
in that decision

651
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
and you would imagine that the same

652
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,039
approach to applied to armed conflict

653
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,279
would be even more modest

654
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
even more cautious

655
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
but it means something

656
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
it means states

657
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,279
that through their cyber operations for

658
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
example affect the privacy of

659
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,880
individuals in armed conflict need to

660
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,559
have some rules written down somewhere

661
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,480
that govern this

662
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
that they need to have procedures that

663
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,320
govern this that they need to have

664
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,039
oversight mechanisms that will check

665
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,000
that the rules are complied with

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
that is a reasonable modest demand

667
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
that most states at least

668
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,640
can comply with practically so that's

669
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
the first challenge

670
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
the second one is the issue of people in

671
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
detention whether powers or civilians

672
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,159
subject to internment and so on again

673
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,520
thank ukraine

674
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
and there is an excellent chapter by

675
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
emily crawford in the book

676
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
that deals specifically with this issue

677
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
the third challenge is cyber operations

678
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
that destroy

679
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
private data

680
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
or that otherwise manipulate or harm

681
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
that data

682
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
or that do something with it for example

683
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,760
dump it online so people can see it

684
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
now as you all know there is a huge

685
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,400
debate in the confines of ihl

686
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
whether data is an object for the

687
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
purpose of targeting rules in ihl

688
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
and i don't want to get into that

689
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,000
i will only say this even if it's not an

690
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,520
object

691
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,039
the human right to privacy applies

692
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,039
it will regulate what the state may or

693
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,840
may not do regardless of whether data is

694
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,360
an object for the purpose of ihl so even

695
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
if you say data is not an object it

696
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
doesn't mean it's a free-for-all but

697
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,400
there's still a part of international

698
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,159
law that can

699
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,679
do something

700
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,440
now then there is the issue of

701
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
intelligence sharing that again there's

702
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,799
an excellent chapter

703
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
uh in the book about

704
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,039
uh deborah

705
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,120
we have seen this in

706
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
in the uh

707
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,760
uh in the context of ukraine

708
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
with all sorts of states sharing

709
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
intelligence with ukraine before and

710
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
during the conflict including for

711
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,720
specific targeting purposes

712
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
much of that type of intelligence

713
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
sharing activity

714
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
does not really involve information that

715
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,520
is in any sense private

716
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
so if for example

717
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,679
the united states tells ukraine

718
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,760
there's an attack coming on the military

719
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
airport near kiev

720
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
or the russian mobile headquarters in

721
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
the nunes region are on such and such

722
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,159
coordinates

723
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
this does not implicate the right to

724
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,679
privacy

725
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,720
this isn't private information

726
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,919
but

727
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,600
if they send information about the

728
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
identity of specific individuals

729
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
their facial recognition features

730
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,399
biometric profiles whatever this does

731
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,480
implicate the right to privacy

732
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
and

733
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,399
the rules of international human rights

734
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
law and the rules of data protection at

735
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
least need to be complied with to some

736
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,679
extent

737
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,360
and the final challenge is the issue of

738
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,200
extraterrestriality

739
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
to what extent

740
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
the

741
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,880
human rights privacy applies to state

742
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
action outside its borders

743
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
it's a long story

744
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
but let's say the right answer is that

745
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
it does

746
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,039
now

747
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,360
it applies on a very individual level

748
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
outside armed conflict

749
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,960
it applies to my mind at a mass bulk

750
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,399
collection level and in armed conflict

751
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,480
think one example

752
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
jeff bezos at the time the richest man

753
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
in the world

754
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,279
personally gets hacked

755
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
by muhammad bin salman

756
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,799
through a corrupted whatsapp message

757
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,559
okay

758
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,399
saudi arabia hacks one guy

759
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,640
in america

760
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
it is to my mind as a human rights

761
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
lawyer

762
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,240
normatively completely incoherent to say

763
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
that if saudi arabia spies on saudis

764
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,799
that's a human rights issue

765
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,880
but if saudi arabia spies an american

766
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
guy in america suddenly human rights law

767
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,880
no longer applies

768
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
makes no sense

769
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,919
okay

770
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,440
in just the same way that if saudi

771
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
arabia kills somebody in saudi arabia

772
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,360
that's a violation of the right to life

773
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
and if they kill jamal khashoggi in

774
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,880
istanbul that's also a violation of the

775
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
right to life

776
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
so the right to privacy does apply

777
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
extraterritorially whenever states do

778
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,039
something that affects it the issue is

779
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,279
when exactly and how

780
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,880
now i will just end here with by

781
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,159
mentioning

782
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,200
four

783
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,559
really good

784
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
uh chapters that i really think are

785
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
specifically worth the read from a human

786
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,760
rights standpoint

787
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,720
one is by tom imran and yuval shani on

788
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
integrating the human rights to privacy

789
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
to weapons reviews

790
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,120
which is not something i think ihl

791
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,919
experts would ever have thought of

792
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,279
a second a really poignant chapter

793
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,360
by omar shahabi

794
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,159
is on what israel has been doing

795
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,880
in the occupied territories

796
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
now even if you take

797
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,840
a pro-israeli view

798
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,399
of the israeli-palestinian conflict even

799
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
if you do that

800
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,039
when you read

801
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,559
the

802
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
specifics and the comprehensiveness

803
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,159
of surveillance measures that pervade

804
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,720
the everyday life of essentially every

805
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
palestinian

806
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,080
it should really make you think twice

807
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
about what militaries can do and cannot

808
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,000
do

809
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
in an occupation context and again what

810
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,039
russia is now doing in ukraine is very

811
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,080
much along those lines

812
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,600
i already mentioned emily's excellent

813
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,559
piece and pows leah west who was already

814
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,960
mentioned had did an excellent piece on

815
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
on facial recognition

816
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,559
and on how facial recognition and

817
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,159
biometrics

818
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,320
should and should not be used in

819
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,200
targeting processes

820
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,720
now that is not

821
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
something that

822
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,960
i know in the context of a mass conflict

823
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,600
like ukraine russia you will have

824
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,480
done

825
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
but in the context of more novel

826
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,600
targeted terrorism type conflicts where

827
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,679
you know a state is using a drone to

828
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
kill somebody that's very much on the

829
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,600
agenda

830
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,679
and finally there's a really interesting

831
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,760
piece by christina hellwig

832
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,559
on the privacy implications of gathering

833
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,120
evidence for international crimes

834
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
so think for example what the

835
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,519
investigators are doing now in ukraine

836
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,200
digging up mass graves collecting

837
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,679
information on puws

838
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,000
interviewing pows collecting their

839
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
statements all of that information

840
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,440
gathered by ukrainian judges prosecutors

841
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,679
by the icc needs to comply with

842
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,080
international privacy safeguards so i

843
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,679
really enjoyed very much reading this

844
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
book and thank you so much for editing

845
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,480
it and for inviting me to speak about it

846
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
thank you thank you very much marco that

847
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,600
uh that's a lot of food for thought

848
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,679
for us without further ado i think i'll

849
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
hand over to elena thank you very much

850

852
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,240
beginning i would like to thank asif and

855
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,519
book but we mustn't forget on vallartaga

856

did i get it right

857
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
almost you did yeah

858
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,159
um

859
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,559
and i for me as well it was a novel

860
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,720
subject i initially thought when i read

861
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,799
the title they're crazy i mean i had

862
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
exactly the same reactions um and then

863
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
as i got into it i realized of course

864
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,279
that it is incredibly important and that

865
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,840
these folks have actually done a first

866
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,919
in terms of editing a book on this

867
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,159
subject and so i really perceive it as

868
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,159
the start of a conversation

869
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,120
um

870
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
that obviously will continue i

871
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
appreciated the fact that it is

872
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
it was

873
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
the chapters are well written i thought

874
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
and and that they are short

875
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
so folks i mean that that's really one

876
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,960
thing i took away rather than this kind

877
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,440
of endless blah blah repeating

878
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
everything we already know before they

879
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
got to the point the chapters are

880
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,640
between 9 and 15 pages 20 maybe some but

881
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
they're very much to the point and so

882
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,200
you have 17 chapters in a book of 300

883
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
pages and it was just a delight

884
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
to to have people speak to the point

885
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
anyway

886
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
um so i also of course agree with marco

887
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,720
that um

888
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
ihl doesn't say anything about privacy

889
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,399
and armed conflict or data protection in

890
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,480
1949 this was certainly not on the

891
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,960
agenda and we can't make believe it was

892
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
otherwise there are one or two norms

893
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
that could be stretched et cetera et

894
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,880
cetera so i have nothing to add on that

895
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,919
um

896
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,480
what i would like to do however is to i

897
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
intended to

898
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,399
very briefly mention

899
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
the gist of three chapters

900
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,399
some of which marco mentioned as well

901
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,560
and then to to give a few general

902
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
comments that may not necessarily relate

903
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,560
to the book but are more broader really

904
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
on the issue of privacy

905
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
data protection and um and armed

906
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,159
conflict so

907
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,399
so i also thought that leah west's

908
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,320
chapter was was fascinating because she

909
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
talks she gives the facial recognition

910
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,679
um

911
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,480
uh case study to discuss the tension

912
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
between the con the

913
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,800
operational legal requirements to gather

914
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,719
intelligence on the one hand and then

915
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,280
the rights of the civilian population

916
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,199
um to privacy in information operations

917
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,040
what i thought was interesting and i

918
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,560
actually chose these three chapters

919
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,159
because each of them

920
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,399
sort of either post relevant questions

921
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,119
that i thought or suggest way forwards

922
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,719
ways forward

923
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,199
so what she said leah west

924
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,520
she for example asks

925
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
that in future discussions it should be

926
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,240
determined under what circumstances frt

927
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
or similar technologies could be

928
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,280
deployed

929
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,599
what data they will rely on

930
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,839
to identify persons

931
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,760
what data will be collected and how will

932
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,000
consequences of improper use of frts be

933
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,280
be used

934
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,599
be dealt with and she also talks about a

935
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,320
sliding scale which again is a novel

936
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,280
idea to say if you may need to use frt

937
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,359
robustly at the beginning of a conflict

938
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,040
as time goes by

939
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,520
the need for these types of robust

940
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
measures you know will decrease

941
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,160
eliza what

942
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,800
talked about drones and

943
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
the effects of prolonged drone

944
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,040
surveillance and the right to privacy

945
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,359
she also

946
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,119
absolutely recognizes that ihl requires

947
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,800
intelligence collection

948
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
for commanders to be able to comply with

949
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
the principles of distinction

950
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,839
proportionality target verification

951
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,040
she then goes on to

952
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
suggest the expansion of one of the

953
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,839
rules to accommodate data privacy data

954
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,839
and privacy and data protection concerns

955
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,359
which is fifth article 57 of ap1 which

956
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,760
says that in the conduct of military

957
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,560
operations even though the chapter in

958
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,680
ap1 is on attacks but she says

959
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,400
this should be seen as a standalone

960
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
in fact rule um which says that constant

961
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,520
care must be taken in the conduct of

962
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,839
military operations to spare civilians

963
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,440
civilian populations and civilian

964
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,839
objects and she said that that would be

965
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,960
the hook

966
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,000
to

967
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,079
latch

968
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,960
data protection and privacy obligations

969
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,040
on commanders

970
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,279
now

971
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
when she talks about the practical ways

972
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,359
in which this could be done she says

973
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,400
that the

974
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
data protection principles of lawfulness

975
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,960
transparency

976
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,359
and um sorry forgot one and and

977
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,640
oops

978
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,800
yes fairness

979
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,119
should be um

980
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,200
kept in mind now while lawfulness

981
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,280
personally i understand i mean it's

982
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
quite easy to say there is a lawful

983
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,599
basis to do x y and z and any state can

984
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,440
provide such a basis

985
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,400
when it comes to transparency

986
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,880
in drone operations i'm thinking to

987
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,839
myself

988
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,640
how do you do transparency as in

989
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,440
and it's specified that data subjects

990
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,760
should be able to know that this data is

991
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,800
being collected you know etc and

992
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
so that was to me a little bit

993
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,000
unrealistic and that's an understatement

994
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
um

995
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,160
and then emily crawford's chapter is

996
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,800
excellent in the sense that she simply

997
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
shows which i think we all know that the

998
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,119
tension

999
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,200
is particularly strong with respect to

1000
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
detainees and pows and civilian

1001
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,599
attorneys in international armed

1002
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,720
conflict in particular for two reasons

1003
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,119
one is that as we know

1004
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,720
first of all these are security threats

1005
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,400
per se that's why

1006
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
pows that's why they're interned and

1007
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
every manner of data is going to be

1008
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,119
collected on them from the moment they

1009
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,200
are registered onward

1010
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
that their communications may be

1011
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,880
monitored their letters may be censored

1012
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,640
they may be under surveillance or will

1013
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,320
be in camps

1014
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
and just as importantly

1015
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,640
the detaining power has an obligation to

1016
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,000
collect data

1017
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
on such individuals to pass it on to the

1018
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
power of origin as soon as possible or

1019
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,200
to the icrc through the central tracing

1020
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,320
agency

1021
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,680
in terms of who they are you know name a

1022
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,760
whole range of personal facts transfers

1023
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,720
deaths so as to be able to inform the

1024
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
power of origin that the person is in

1025
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,440
the detaining power's um custody and so

1026
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,920
then either the icrc or the power of

1027
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,160
origin will be able to

1028
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,839
um inform the family

1029
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,440
so um

1030
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,359
it's not suggested that this is unlawful

1031
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,040
because it can't possibly be i mean

1032
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,119
there's a very good reason for this but

1033
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,440
what is suggested is simply among other

1034
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,119
things and i'm not doing justice to any

1035
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,359
of these chapters is simply that the

1036
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,960
whole issue of data protection and

1037
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,320
privacy

1038
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,160
would merit a sui generous non-binding

1039
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,000
discussion process i mean

1040
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
a process that would end up with a

1041
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
suigenerous non-binding document that

1042
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,920
would

1043
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,320
look into the issue of

1044
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
data protection and privacy in armed

1045
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,280
conflict

1046
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,599
okay

1047
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,119
so

1048
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,359
as i said all of these chapters and all

1049
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,960
of the others in the book and one of the

1050
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
other things i really really liked about

1051
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
the book is the scope of the chapters so

1052
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,240
deb's chapter dealt with these issues of

1053
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
data protection and privacy in the

1054
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,160
context of multinational military

1055
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,839
operations or inter-interrupt

1056
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,720
interoperability

1057
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
then there's a chapter on cables as was

1058
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,359
read so it's really really a palette

1059
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,720
of of

1060
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,560
a very interesting

1061
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,319
articles

1062
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,880
one thing so the general comments i

1063
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,640
would have however and i really do

1064
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,960
repeat this in all sincerity this is not

1065
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,720
to do with the book it's just more my

1066
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,319
general thinking as

1067
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,480
as an ihl lawyer

1068
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,160
is that

1069
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
the tension between on the one hand

1070
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,240
intelligence gathering and the

1071
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
obligation to do it and on the other

1072
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
hand data protection

1073
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,119
and privacy cannot be overstated in my

1074
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,880
view it just cannot

1075
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
and

1076
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,760
while the book and the chapters often

1077
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
say

1078
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,520
yes yes we need this we i mean uh

1079
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,680
intelligence has to be done so that

1080
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,200
there could be lawful targeting and the

1081
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
principles of ihl will be respected

1082
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,520
it's not very often mentioned that

1083
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,760
actually intelligence gathering is also

1084
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
done for the purpose of the security of

1085
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,880
the

1086
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,040
of one of the party to the conflict of

1087
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
owned forces civilian components

1088
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
military bases what have you both on own

1089
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,359
territory

1090
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,319
and when acting abroad so that's sort of

1091
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,400
security aspect to intelligence

1092
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
collection regardless of whether you

1093
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,880
know we're talking

1094
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,680
active combat if you like is something

1095
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,839
that i i sort of found a little bit

1096
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
lacking

1097
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,280
in this context when we're talking

1098
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359
conduct of hostilities and we think of

1099
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
what one of the main legal bases if you

1100
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,040
read the relevant documents

1101
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,119
non-ihl documents of course is like what

1102
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,560
is the most important thing it is the

1103
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,480
consent of the data subject now consent

1104
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,160
of the data subject in an in an iac or

1105
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
is going to be really difficult and

1106
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,640
already humanitarian organizations such

1107
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,720
as the icrc and others

1108
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,760
who did

1109
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
very thick handbooks on data protection

1110
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,599
by humanitarian organizations in their

1111
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
humanitarian activity have also had to

1112
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,839
come to the conclusion that obtaining

1113
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,200
consent

1114
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,400
you know when you're dealing with an

1115
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
emergency situation

1116
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,680
you have it can be man-made it can be a

1117
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,760
natural disaster you have earthquakes

1118
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
what have you you're coming in you're

1119
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
talking to people you're trying to

1120
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,119
figure out what's going on how to

1121
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,079
produce um rather deliver food etc you

1122
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,680
don't have time to say sir i'm going to

1123
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,319
take down your data or madam and then

1124
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,920
this is what i'm going to do with it and

1125
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,680
do you agree and then there will be

1126
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,599
erasure of the information and all the

1127
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,880
other data protection

1128
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,280
steps or principles that data protection

1129
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,119
human rights law

1130
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,520
and certainly the european gdrp the

1131
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,359
general data protection regulation would

1132
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,599
require so

1133
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,599
you know the first if i can put it that

1134
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,920
way pillar is out

1135
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,480
i mean in most situations

1136
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,079
in a lot of situations it will be a

1137
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,440
given

1138
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,839
and i think that generally speaking

1139
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,040
going forward in discussing this issue

1140
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,839
um

1141
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,280
that a distinction should be made

1142
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,200
between on the one hand data protection

1143
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,119
and conduct of hostilities where you

1144
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,920
will have massive collection of data

1145
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,400
and where the technology will be used in

1146
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,560
quite differently of course and

1147
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,920
i think the principles will be much

1148
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,160
harder to apply and then data protection

1149
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,960
and privacy in situations of detention

1150
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
for the reasons that were mentioned you

1151
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,720
have the person in custody and so the

1152
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,880
question can be

1153
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,040
what level and what scope of personal

1154
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,160
information

1155
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,880
may you need in order to

1156
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,480
satisfy your

1157
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,160
your security

1158
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,040
considerations

1159
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,720
just to park one issue is that

1160
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,880
iac and nyack and data protection in

1161
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,319
international and non-international

1162
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,200
armed conflict question mark what do we

1163
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,599
do with non-state armed groups principle

1164
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,839
of belligerent equality blah blah blah i

1165
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,280
personally don't believe contrary to

1166
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,720
many on the panel

1167
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,480
i think that human rights group that

1168
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,040
human rights binds nsa non-state armed

1169
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,920
groups de ure i don't believe so and so

1170
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,240
that's a whole different can of worms

1171
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,000
that would have to be opened

1172
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,440
and then we come to the crux of the

1173
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,520
matter i think

1174
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,280
which is the relationship between ihl

1175
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,359
and human rights and how the books

1176
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,960
contributors and i'm sure the human

1177
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
rights community are going to deal more

1178
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,720
generally with

1179
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,839
yes

1180
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,440
more generally but the relationship by

1181
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
basically saying which is what the book

1182
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
says

1183
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,480
this is an old discussion we are just

1184
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,920
going to assume that human rights and

1185
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,079
ihl apply concurrently or in a

1186
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,319
complementary fashion i don't disagree

1187
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,359
with that

1188
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,760
but i would make three points which

1189
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,800
always come up and drive me personally

1190
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,160
completely mad

1191
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,960
i mean

1192
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
because there's never an answer

1193
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,119
when somebody says human rights law

1194
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,960
applies concurrently that doesn't mean

1195
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,000
anything to me i mean what exactly are

1196
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,480
you referring to what scope you know

1197
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,560
where is the binding law you know what

1198
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,280
exactly are we talking about and that

1199
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,880
discussion and the domain of data

1200
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,079
protection and privacy in armed conflict

1201
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,560
certainly i mean definitely remains

1202
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,480
you know remains on the table so

1203
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,480
what

1204
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
data protection and privacy in human

1205
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,880
rights oops i'm being too loud

1206
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,680
will mean in any um given case is not

1207
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,560
clear

1208
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,880
and certainly um

1209
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,000
states will have different

1210
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,079
interpretations based

1211
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,240
in addition on whether they accept extra

1212
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,960
territorial application i may agree or

1213
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,480
disagree with this

1214
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,119
but the fact is that a lot

1215
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,480
let me put it this way several

1216
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,720
significant states that do wage wars all

1217
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,440
the time or quite frequently reject the

1218
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,359
applic the extraterritorial application

1219
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,760
of human rights law so we i mean that

1220
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,240
conundrum cannot simply be

1221
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,720
simply be wished away

1222
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,520
in this respect

1223
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,920
having worked at the icrc i'm no longer

1224
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,440
with the icrc i'm speaking in my

1225
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,960
personal capacity

1226
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,560
one of the things as a practitioner that

1227
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,040
i always came up against

1228
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,119
was when we would i would sit across

1229
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,640
militaries and they would go okay so

1230
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
what's the source of this obligation

1231
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,119
this was my constant problem and there's

1232
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,079
problem

1233
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,119
this was a valid legal question so

1234
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,960
we didn't i didn't have the luxury to

1235
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,040
say i'm going to throw the kitchen sink

1236
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
at you and the special rapper tours

1237
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,520
reports and this and that and the other

1238
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,440
that everyone thinks of his human rights

1239
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,720
law so

1240
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,480
if there's going to be a constructive

1241
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,640
discussion on privacy and data

1242
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,560
protection and armed conflict

1243
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,480
what is the binding law

1244
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,760
is going to be unbelievably important

1245
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,720
and as a policy matter one has to decide

1246
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,560
i think going forward if there is going

1247
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,480
to be a forward is

1248
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
as i said do you throw the kitchen sink

1249
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,680
and just

1250
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,640
conduct an academic discussion and say

1251
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,960
human rights applies with not much

1252
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,079
precision

1253
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,359
or do you try and unpack

1254
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,640
you know slowly but surely one by one

1255
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
what is more realistic to begin with

1256
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,200
you know as a matter of

1257
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,640
privacy and data protection and armed

1258
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,200
conflict and then work upwards or

1259
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,359
downwards whichever way you like but the

1260
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,200
most important thing is with military

1261
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,599
practitioners people who are going to

1262
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,880
tell you or us you're crazy i mean i

1263
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,520
pretty much have no no doubt about that

1264
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,599
another issue with with human rights law

1265
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,760
and this also has driven me pretty

1266
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,440
bananas in the past

1267
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
is that human rights lawyers they always

1268
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,359
tend to talk about human rights as being

1269
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,720
european law

1270
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
and particularly the european court of

1271
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,200
human rights and what the eu does and in

1272
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,599
this particular domain it's really the

1273
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,520
bulk of the law

1274
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,920
and so to say that other countries are

1275
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,160
going to be jumping up and down with joy

1276
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,599
to

1277
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,880
adopt the gdpr and etc

1278
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,640
you know again there needs to be more

1279
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,839
rigor

1280
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,960
in determining you know not only what is

1281
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,720
the binding law but what region of the

1282
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,480
world in fact

1283
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,839
does it

1284
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,240
does it emanate from and this is really

1285
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,319
a region in which i mean a situation in

1286
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,559
which european law

1287
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,680
has been

1288
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,520
predominant

1289
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,559
i'm actually finishing believe it or not

1290
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,280
so

1291
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,800
my sense would be is and if i were um

1292
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,640
kind of called to think about this

1293
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,720
further

1294
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,119
if you look at the data protection

1295
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,319
principles

1296
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,640
under the gdpr because this is the

1297
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,400
document of reference as i mentioned

1298
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,280
it's european then

1299
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,119
my concern um

1300
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,440
would be for example to look immediately

1301
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,040
and most

1302
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,400
um

1303
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,680
in great detail about two issues one is

1304
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,200
the issue of data security by

1305
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
parties to an armed conflict

1306
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,800
you know how do they

1307
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,319
when they collect it whether it's in

1308
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,240
conduct of hostilities or in detention

1309
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
what do you first of all

1310
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,400
to the extent possible what is the

1311
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
purpose limitation if any but secondly

1312
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,319
what is the storage

1313
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,319
meaning physical storage of the data and

1314
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,079
then secondly what organizational and

1315
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,400
technical measures are taken to preserve

1316
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,079
the data

1317
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,079
so it doesn't fall into either

1318
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,559
unauthorized hands within your own

1319
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,079
people or

1320
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,079
cannot be hacked you know by third

1321
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,720
parties for nefarious purposes

1322
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,680
so data security is incredibly important

1323
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,760
i was also thinking to myself then maybe

1324
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,599
this is a provocative question which is

1325
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,160
the issue of time limitation if armed

1326
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,599
conflict ends

1327
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,520
as we know at the end of active

1328
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,640
hostilities iac as well as nyack

1329
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,960
obviously when there is no more fighting

1330
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,880
not to go into the legal niceties of

1331
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,240
what that is

1332
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,119
then why would states keep

1333
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,160
data

1334
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,400
particularly in an iac of millions of

1335
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
enemy

1336
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,480
citizens whether they be pows or

1337
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,680
civilians

1338
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,720
whom

1339
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,319
they had collected data on so in the

1340
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,760
book one of the articles says that the

1341
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,440
u.s has collected

1342
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,839
you know 2 million

1343
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,240
files on 2 million persons biometric

1344
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,040
data in iraq so

1345
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,359
i understand the emotional resonance i

1346
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,599
truly do of ukraine but this is by no

1347
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,440
means what the russians are doing or is

1348
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,520
by no means um

1349
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,720
how do you say

1350
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,760
uh

1351
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,480
exceptional biometrics have been around

1352
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,720
for a long time and maybe one of the

1353
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,400
first things that needs to be discussed

1354
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,119
is biometrics and armed conflict what is

1355
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,200
the purpose of them and then i mean

1356
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
that's a discrete that's a sort of

1357
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,839
discrete issue

1358
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,119
and then as i said lawfulness consent is

1359
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,839
going to be a problem purpose limitation

1360
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,079
it's probably possible in

1361
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,280
detention

1362
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,440
probably less likely in the conduct of

1363
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,640
hostilities

1364
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,800
storage limitation data security and

1365
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,079
then

1366
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,040
accountability once again

1367
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,359
accountability uh yes you can have

1368
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,839
oversight mechanisms i'm sure to look

1369
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,480
at whether data protection and privacy

1370
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,480
have been respected in armed conflict

1371
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,800
but the point is as a matter of human

1372
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
rights law it's really the individual

1373
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
who should be able to go to an authority

1374
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,720
and say i want to know

1375
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,000
what you have on me and i thought tim

1376
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
cochrane's

1377
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,680
chapter was kind of touching in that

1378
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,440
respect because he basically says that

1379
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,280
an afghan civilian

1380
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,000
who by the way in like 90 or i'm

1381
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,480
exaggerating 75 percent of cases will be

1382
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,720
illiterate the idea that he or she are

1383
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,400
going to go to the us or any other

1384
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,480
military and say i'd like to know what

1385
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,079
you have on me and then i'd like it to

1386
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,079
be erased and that i'd like it to be

1387
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,920
accurate if you're going to hang on to

1388
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,280
it

1389
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,240
you know we we've got to get real it's

1390
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,079
not for a minute really denying the

1391
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,760
importance of the issue which i think is

1392
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,920
open and and will continue

1393
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,960
and my last two points really quickly

1394
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,119
i was and maybe this is a pie in the sky

1395
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,960
for my part but i was struck by the fact

1396
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,760
that

1397
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,680
and maybe this is because not military

1398
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,839
practitioners were not involved

1399
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,760
necessarily in the book is why the

1400
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,520
notion of feasibility and military

1401
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,640
necessity were not introduced at in some

1402
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,680
shape or form in in the discussion

1403
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,839
you know because feasibility is is a

1404
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,359
it is a term that that can you know

1405
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,640
serve

1406
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
useful purposes and yet

1407
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
enable you know the keeping of

1408
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,559
flexibility um in our conflict and then

1409
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,400
for military necessity i could see it

1410
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,000
more

1411
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,160
you know already for example in pow

1412
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,720
situations pw's are obliged to give a

1413
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,400
very limited amount of information to

1414
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,160
their captors

1415
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,000
i know mike is going to react and that's

1416
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,400
that's very fine

1417
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,440
but and i can answer that i think

1418
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,240
but the the issue is if a pow is not

1419
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,000
obliged to give to the captor anything

1420
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
more than name last name regimental

1421
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,359
number rank etc then why would any other

1422
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,280
information be available to the captor

1423
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,800
i mean

1424
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
it's it's just a question

1425
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,559
and then my final point is that um

1426
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,480
one thing that going forward also needs

1427
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,839
to be discussed

1428
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,559
is that again talking from practice

1429
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,480
um militaries

1430
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,160
or the ones i've been in touch with very

1431
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,119
rarely do something

1432
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,200
out of pure altruism

1433
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,720
which i think

1434
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,040
everyone around this room knows so there

1435
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,599
there's got to be something that either

1436
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,000
they understand will benefit them in the

1437
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
immediate or the longer term so there's

1438
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,359
also needs to be thinking because

1439
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,760
the application of these issues or these

1440
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,680
rules in our conflict what does it mean

1441
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,640
it means

1442
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,000
resources

1443
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,119
means people it means training it means

1444
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,200
doctrinal adaptations it will mean a

1445
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
whole range of things if it ever were to

1446
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,559
come really into you know military

1447
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,880
thinking mainstream and so the question

1448
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,240
is really

1449
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,160
what are the incentives is it just

1450
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,760
reciprocity

1451
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,559
i mean de facto reciprocity of course

1452
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,920
or um

1453
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,280
would it be something else and the

1454
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,440
reason i say this is because in issues

1455
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,280
that are much more

1456
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,559
uh have much more immediate consequences

1457
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,000
and the where the militaries understand

1458
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
um the consequences of not

1459
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,680
doing getting it right such as

1460
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,760
investigations in armed conflict which

1461
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,160
is an issue i have dealt with before

1462
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,240
it's very hard to get them to do

1463
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,880
resources funding and all of this and

1464
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,319
they keep saying oh this is too time

1465
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,319
consuming this is to funding consuming

1466
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,839
et cetera et cetera

1467
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,200
and so

1468
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,880
there needs to be

1469
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,839
you know a broader sort of mix of of

1470
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,480
thinking

1471
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,640
on an issue that's been well identified

1472
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,119
definitely and so kudos for that i say

1473
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,280
that sincerely to the both of you

1474
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,559
um

1475
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,079
but maybe

1476
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,720
a more narrow focus and with perhaps uh

1477
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,799
the audience you know that wages wars

1478
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,040
which is members of the armed forces so

1479
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,400
i'll

1480
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,920
thank you sorry to have been so long

1481
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,760
that was great thank you for the you're

1482
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,599
very careful reading and review of the

1483
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,280
book you contextualized the discussions

1484
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,240
but also brought new life to them

1485
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,480
without further ado we'll pass to

1486
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,640
eduardo thank you very much thank you

1487
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,000
thank you very much

1488
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,240
and good afternoon everybody

1489
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,559
let me start with a with a confession

1490
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,000
and listen an acknowledgement which is

1491
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,520
i'm new to this world

1492
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,799
to this

1493
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,280
not not at the conference stages or

1494
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,839
cyber security the arm conflict

1495
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,559
world i'm a lawyer i'm

1496
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,400
based in london i work in a law firm

1497
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,680
i've spent my entire professional career

1498
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,559
working in a non-conflict related

1499
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,119
environment my my only involvement in

1500
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,599
this world was uh many many years ago

1501
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,920
serving in doing my military service

1502
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,839
more than three decades ago in the

1503
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,160
spanish army and then after that i

1504
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,640
entered the sort of what to me has been

1505
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,079
the normal world

1506
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,559
and of course data protection which is

1507
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,319
what i practice

1508
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,319
has always been

1509
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,520
outside

1510
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,880
the military context the armed conflict

1511
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,200
and a bit like what you were saying

1512
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,359
a book about data protection in the

1513
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,559
context of armed conflict what does that

1514
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,680
have to do with it and

1515
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,720
what i

1516
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,799
deal with on a daily basis which is due

1517
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,240
to refer to the gdpr the gdpr is is my

1518
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
bible in in a way in the sense that's

1519
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,520
that's

1520
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,680
what i what i have to

1521
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,319
to advise on what i work on

1522
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,520
all the hours of the day and the gdpr

1523
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,000
the european union data protect general

1524
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
data protection regulation

1525
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,520
specifically

1526
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,480
excludes certain aspects from the

1527
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,480
uh scope

1528
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,960
from the the scope of of what the law is

1529
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,839
about

1530
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,319
and it doesn't say oh it doesn't apply

1531
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,760
in a military context it doesn't say

1532
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,040
that at all

1533
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,160
but it does

1534
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,400
refer to the fact that

1535
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,040
european union law

1536
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,520
does not apply to certain elements like

1537
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,079
for example national security which as

1538
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,440
the world suggests

1539
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,240
is for the nations for the countries

1540
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
so basically this is all to say

1541
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,480
that until now

1542
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,160
i thought well

1543
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,119
data protection the

1544
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,720
the military

1545
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,480
is not something that i see being

1546
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,960
related to

1547
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,799
this book

1548
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,119
this changes all that

1549
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,240
this it really if there is one thing

1550
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,160
that i've realized is that of course

1551
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,240
privacy and data protection are very

1552
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,680
very relevant

1553
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,520
to this world of

1554
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,040
conflict

1555
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,799
and

1556
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,680
the one thing also that i think if there

1557
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,520
is one thing you learn from from the

1558
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,920
book and and i do encourage everybody to

1559
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,520
to read there are loads of things that

1560
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,240
we we will learn but there is one

1561
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,680
key message

1562
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,520
that i got out of it

1563
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,760
is that

1564
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,880
international human rights

1565
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,200
law

1566
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,400
is very very relevant

1567
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,160
to armed conflict

1568
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,520
and of course again in in the world of

1569
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,040
of conflict we're used to or at least uh

1570
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,119
you are used to in international

1571
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,280
humanitarian law dealing with with that

1572
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,440
element of that well

1573
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,720
i think

1574
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,559
your your bit of human rights

1575
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,240
is very very very relevant and i think

1576
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,440
that comes across very strongly across

1577
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,559
across the the chapters and across

1578
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,200
everything that um

1579
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,799
is is the the mosaic in a way that this

1580
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,400
this book is

1581
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,559
so

1582
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,480
what i also uh

1583
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,599
learned

1584
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,720
from from

1585
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,640
the book is that there are things that i

1586
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960
deal with on a daily basis

1587
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,640
that i can see how relevant

1588
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,920
they are

1589
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,440
to armor conflict for example

1590
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,079
we i work with some of the leading

1591
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,160
technology companies in the world those

1592
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,400
are my clients and i and and i have to

1593
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,520
be at the forefront of what technology

1594
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,359
is and how it develops

1595
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,400
well

1596
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,359
it is very obvious reading the chapters

1597
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,640
of this book

1598
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,240
that

1599
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,760
and i guess you don't even need to read

1600
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,520
the book to realize that the

1601
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,319
technological development is also at the

1602
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,599
forefront

1603
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,240
of armed conflict

1604
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,040
in fact is is the perfect testbed to to

1605
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,079
to develop and to put into practice some

1606
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,119
of the technologies that are really

1607
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,480
defining

1608
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,799
human evolution right now and the kind

1609
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,119
of things i deal with

1610
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,640
biometrics

1611
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,720
facial recognition artificial

1612
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,359
intelligence

1613
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:04,640
communications all of these different

1614
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,799
things

1615
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,280
are obviously very very relevant

1616
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,880
facial recognition

1617
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,720
it's interesting you said well

1618
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
is that even relevant for example to to

1619
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,319
the war in ukraine well

1620
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,359
if you you have a drone that is

1621
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,240
targeting a particular let's say general

1622
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,359
and try to recognize a face

1623
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,480
from

1624
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,680
many miles up in the earth

1625
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,599
facial recognition is indeed very

1626
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,160
relevant and it may have actually proved

1627
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,079
crucial in in the conflict that we're

1628
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,319
seeing now

1629
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,319
all types of technologies

1630
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,119
that

1631
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,799
again

1632
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,200
we are testing from a privacy from a

1633
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
data protection perspective some of the

1634
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,400
points you were making about um

1635
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,359
how

1636
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,880
the law

1637
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,079
outside conflict the law and the gdpr

1638
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,559
has been written in a way that is

1639
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,000
designed

1640
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,960
to test technologies upfront so there is

1641
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,880
a whole

1642
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,119
mechanism legal mechanism

1643
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,920
to ensure that from the at the outset

1644
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,880
from the point of view of from the point

1645
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,040
of of development

1646
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,680
privacy and data protections

1647
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,920
are very much taken into account and

1648
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,760
this i think is is relevant in this

1649
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,119
context

1650
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,359
cyber security i mean this

1651
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,480
this event is about cyber conflict

1652
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,880
same cyber attacks

1653
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,480
i think are probably

1654
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,400
one of the most powerful

1655
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,640
weapons from the point of view of the

1656
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,760
wider effect that they may have

1657
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,839
and i have seen clients

1658
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,000
um which are not in the in the military

1659
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,640
world being attacked by state agents

1660
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,200
and crippling their organizations

1661
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,920
worldwide well again this is something

1662
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,680
that from the point of view of

1663
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,960
cyber defense

1664
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,160
is is pretty obvious but it's also

1665
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,640
it's also highlights from me

1666
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,839
how

1667
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,520
much overlap

1668
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,160
there is between the sort of what i

1669
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,400
would call the the state side of things

1670
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,559
the private the public sector side of

1671
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,599
things

1672
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,160
and the private sector

1673
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,960
and

1674
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,760
the one that i'm closer to and

1675
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,559
how important it is for

1676
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,240
the private sector

1677
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,440
to be aware of the

1678
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,880
cyber threats that have a military

1679
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,480
origin everyone

1680
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,280
or military

1681
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,559
aim

1682
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,799
and how affected

1683
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,119
everyone is whether you're shopping at

1684
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,799
amazon or

1685
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,359
using your credit card or whatever your

1686
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,640
we are doing

1687
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,520
how

1688
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,760
affected we are by

1689
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,920
again military related cyber attacks and

1690
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,760
then there is another aspect of

1691
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,480
the law i deal with which i again

1692
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,039
comes across very very clearly here

1693
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:19,039
which is um international data transfers

1694
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,520
again in the world in which the

1695
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,520
professional world which i inhabit

1696
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,440
international data transfers are

1697
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,880
probably the number one concern

1698
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,640
because

1699
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,319
data protection laws around the world

1700
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,920
govern how

1701
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,720
data personal data can flow

1702
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,039
and they place limitations and a lot of

1703
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,000
the limitations have to do with

1704
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,640
ensuring that the data is protected in

1705
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,799
accordance with the european standards

1706
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,200
if you're in euro the the standards of

1707
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,839
of the country of origin

1708
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,640
again reading in fact uh

1709
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,319
chapters about

1710
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,200
the importance of recognizing

1711
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,920
the international element

1712
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,640
of

1713
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,000
conflict

1714
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,319
it is pretty obvious to me that

1715
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,280
recognizing the importance of addressing

1716
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,760
not just international data flows but

1717
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,359
international data protection

1718
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,599
in a way that is consistent

1719
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,280
with the global nature of

1720
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,319
data

1721
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,319
is really really important

1722
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,640
and the final point that i would make in

1723
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,960
terms of the overall

1724
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,039
message that i

1725
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,839
i took away is that

1726
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,280
interestingly

1727
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,079
again in in the data protection world in

1728
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,680
which i normally

1729
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,319
operate and the gdpr again is at the at

1730
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,400
the essence of that

1731
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
we always talk about the risk-based

1732
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,680
approach

1733
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,559
how

1734
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,400
the law

1735
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,480
needs to be interpreted

1736
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,760
in a way that ch is not

1737
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,559
an absolute way it's it changes or the

1738
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,280
the degree

1739
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,880
of the sort of the degree by which

1740
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,480
obligations

1741
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,799
under the law apply

1742
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,520
will be slightly different depending on

1743
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,440
the risk

1744
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,720
again

1745
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,480
the risk

1746
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,599
and the and the importance and the

1747
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,280
context

1748
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,119
you know going back to the to your point

1749
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,240
the context of conflict and the

1750
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,480
importance of

1751
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,599
you know

1752
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,640
i guess

1753
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,520
some

1754
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,720
um

1755
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,400
some people defending their their own

1756
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,119
country for example and

1757
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,079
how

1758
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,839
you apply

1759
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,280
data protection on privacy law in that

1760
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,720
much wider context is very much related

1761
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,200
to that risk-based approach which in

1762
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,480
fact is

1763
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,640
at the essence of what data protection

1764
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,000
or modern data protection is about so

1765
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,440
i've learned a lot

1766
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,480
um

1767
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,520
and

1768
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,160
i think it is really really

1769
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,400
um refreshing in a way

1770
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,079
to to know

1771
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,039
that data protection privacy as a

1772
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,000
discipline is also very very very

1773
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,520
relevant in the context of arm conflict

1774
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,240
so um i thought i i just took

1775
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,640
a ton of amounts of notes as as everyone

1776
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,720
was taking i thought i want to just

1777
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,000
react to a few things that were

1778
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,680
mentioned across the panel that i do

1779
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,880
think would be interesting to the

1780
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,520
broader audience watching this

1781
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,599
and it might further shed light about

1782
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,119
the importance of the project in a

1783
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,039
broader sense

1784
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,799
what we're talking about in this book

1785
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,880
already shapes the way militaries are

1786
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,599
currently behaving right now

1787
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,640
and

1788
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,280
in that regard what we're discussing

1789
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,000
throughout the book isn't only

1790
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,599
about the kind of future looking

1791
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,559
desired approaches of some human rights

1792
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,720
folks who want to change the world and

1793
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,880
will never get to do it i just want to

1794
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,480
highlight you a few ways by which

1795
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
militaries have to deal with the issues

1796
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,640
that the book discusses already today

1797
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,119
and the first is market pressures

1798
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,119
so right now militaries are contracting

1799
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,799
with private companies to develop the

1800
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,280
very technologies at the heart of the

1801
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,200
discussions that we've been having and

1802
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,720
it is the companies that eduardo advises

1803
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,640
while providing the technologies back to

1804
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,119
those militaries and those companies

1805
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,440
unlike the militaries who might bmu into

1806
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,359
certain data protection regimes it is

1807
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,119
those companies who are not

1808
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,039
and it is in that sense when they engage

1809
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,000
with data sets they are applying data

1810
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
protection rules and by default making

1811
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,520
the militaries comply with certain data

1812
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,720
protection standards or the contract

1813
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,839
might try to immune immunize or exclude

1814
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,160
the application of their protection in

1815
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,000
the context of these um

1816
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,440
contracting around the development of

1817
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,280
new technologies and i think that that

1818
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,760
generates new complex contract law

1819
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,640
questions around the reliance on

1820
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,480
outsourcing to private companies in the

1821
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,880
development of say military ai

1822
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,680
applications or military biometric

1823
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,680
analysis solutions and so on and so

1824
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,480
forth a second problem is constitutional

1825
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,679
constraints and here tim's chapter in

1826
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,920
the book i think is really revealing

1827
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
when the military collects data about

1828
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,439
the military about its own forces

1829
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,238
say the health information of your own

1830
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,198
soldiers and say shares that data then

1831
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,880
with

1832
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,198
other militaries through a data sharing

1833
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,640
arrangement

1834
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,319
well now you have a lot of really

1835
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,439
complex questions around the

1836
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,640
constitutional limitations around the

1837
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,120
collection data on your own citizens and

1838
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,880
then that sharing of that data with

1839
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,520
third parties um and that's questions

1840
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,799
the militaries have to deal with because

1841
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,439
every time they engage in a joint

1842
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,000
operations or joint exercises and need

1843
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,439
to share certain information about the

1844
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,279
people participating that's personally

1845
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,359
identifiable information

1846
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,120
and someone needs to decide which law

1847
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,279
applies in the regulation of those

1848
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,439
activities and that ties to various

1849
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,759
other types of peer constraints and i

1850
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,319
think deb's chapter really demonstrates

1851
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,640
peer constraints in this regard and i

1852
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,799
think that across going back even

1853
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,158
outside of the data protection context

1854
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,839
to intelligence sharing

1855
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,920
the way other intelligence agencies

1856
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,679
would work with you or refuse to work

1857
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,359
with you unless you comply with certain

1858
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,679
standards sets restrictions and

1859
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,759
obligations and so in that regard if a

1860
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,080
german intelligence agency has to comply

1861
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,479
with the gdpr because the germans have

1862
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,399
determined that the gdpr certain data

1863
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,319
protection standards apply to german

1864
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,759
operations

1865
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,520
it will then compel the usa if you want

1866
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,960
to share data with me if you want me to

1867
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,279
share data with you to comply with those

1868
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,120
standards creating

1869
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,399
echoing effects

1870
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,560
across their data flows and data

1871
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,640
transfers

1872
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,280
and the last one i think to demonstrate

1873
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,760
why it's not all about pure altruism has

1874
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,360
to do with interoperability and

1875
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,520
confidentiality at the end of the day

1876
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,280
the militaries who are engaging in these

1877
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,159
activities have built-in desires to

1878
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,920
ensure that the data they're collecting

1879
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,640
is secure and that um as they're

1880
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,400
collecting data across all their

1881
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,239
databases there's various

1882
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,239
interoperability challenges that would

1883
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,560
mean that if a leak here happens it

1884
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,640
could flow to leaks elsewhere across my

1885
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,760
systems

1886
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,159
thereby generating the desire to create

1887
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,080
good practices of data protection and

1888
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,320
cyber security across the entirety of

1889
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,679
your network

1890
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,520
and not setting different standards in

1891
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,400
different contexts and i think that all

1892
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,840
all throughout these areas that

1893
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,760
generates um

1894
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,000
a need for these militaries to just

1895
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,199
speak up

1896
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,679
and so i completely take the point and

1897
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,600
it is a true point that the majority of

1898
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,560
this book is the writings of academics

1899
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,800
while some of us have worked within

1900
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
militaries and certainly have

1901
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,120
experienced experiences around military

1902
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,360
work the book is not written with a

1903
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,719
military

1904
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,480
professional practice

1905
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,880
experience in mind

1906
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,800
but at the same time those militaries

1907
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,560
are engaging in these practices and are

1908
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,719
failing to articulate publicly what

1909
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,640
they're doing covertly

1910
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,800
and so what the book is doing is just

1911
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,040
inviting and demonstrating a

1912
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,760
demonstration across an array of areas

1913
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,120
where the militaries are currently

1914
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,800
engaging with decisions around data

1915
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,880
protection uh data collection data

1916
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,199
processing and all of that and then

1917
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,719
inviting them well instead of us

1918
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,080
academics coming here and telling you

1919
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,520
what to do or telling you what you

1920
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,880
should do

1921
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,320
maybe you can come in and tell us what

1922
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,560
you're actually doing and we can start

1923
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,199
developing at the minimum best practices

1924
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,600
at the maximum customary norms or

1925
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,760
interpretations of existing treaty

1926
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,920
obligations just two more points for me

1927
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,679
and then i i i'll

1928
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,920
move to russell i don't want to hog the

1929
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,880
time just two more thoughts one is

1930
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,719
on june 15 the american society of

1931
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,640
international law international law and

1932
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,480
technology interest group is holding a

1933
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,400
virtual event on the data protection

1934
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,400
obligations of international courts and

1935
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
international organizations and we're

1936
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,520
bringing in

1937
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,960
representatives from the icr icc

1938
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,560
which is an interesting body we've been

1939
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,880
engaging in as as

1940
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,640
christina hellwig's chapter demonstrates

1941
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,080
has been engaging in vast data

1942
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,440
collection for its internal

1943
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,400
investigations and yet has no policy on

1944
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,120
privacy no public facing data protection

1945
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,239
standards um and so

1946
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,880
these are some of the bodies icrcs

1947
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,719
another one and i obviously write a

1948
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,480
controversial chapter in this book about

1949
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,320
the icrc that i'll admit is

1950
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,760
controversial

1951
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,560
but

1952
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,719
these are bodies that we look up to and

1953
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,440
expect to adopt the highest possible

1954
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,480
standard and yet there's a whole

1955
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,960
spectrum of action across these

1956
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,239
international courts international

1957
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,719
organizations i'll just name one case

1958
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,640
the special tribunal for lebanon el

1959
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,480
elyos decision

1960
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,560
in which the court literally says we're

1961
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,199
a chapter seven court so we're above any

1962
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,800
human rights norms

1963
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,640
and therefore when we engage in mass

1964
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,640
data collection over 10 years of

1965
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,640
geolocation data from the phones of

1966
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,199
everyone in lebanon we're somehow not

1967
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,040
going to apply any privacy standards at

1968
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,120
the request of the defense because we're

1969
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,560
above that

1970
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,679
i think that there's really

1971
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,360
controversial and problematic areas and

1972
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,800
that's before we started talking about

1973
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,560
militaries and states these are the

1974
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,719
entities that we'd expect at a minimum

1975
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,800
to apply these rules as a matter of

1976
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,679
international law binding on them not

1977
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,440
just as a matter of a general best

1978
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,560
practice

1979
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,360
voluntary application of these rules the

1980
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,360
last thing i want to mention i'll stop

1981
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,239
there is that it is absolutely true

1982
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,760
that when we talk about some of these

1983
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,199
data protection standards they will have

1984
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,400
to be re-assessed and re-evaluated and

1985
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,840
morphed to accommodate the unique

1986
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,360
specialized elements of war

1987
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,120
and the military necessity needs

1988
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,960
humanitarian requirements and so on and

1989
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,800
so when we talk about things i think um

1990
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,880
correctly identified like transparency

1991
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,199
or consent of the data subjects

1992
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,520
how that manifests in an armed conflict

1993
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,920
situation will need to be different and

1994
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,159
that is that relationship that amorphous

1995
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,520
and who knows how it applies like

1996
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
specialist general generalist

1997
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,679
relationship that we talk about in other

1998
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,199
contexts of application of human rights

1999
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,040
law and ihl

2000
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,320
and yet

2001
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,080
it is not to say that these rights

2002
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,040
should be completely taken out the table

2003
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,800
so in the transparency context the

2004
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,480
european court of human rights in big

2005
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,719
brother watch the uk didn't remove the

2006
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,960
right of an individual to seek

2007
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,880
an ability to go to courts in a foreign

2008
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,040
country and ask that country can you

2009
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,719
tell me what data you've collected about

2010
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:35,679
me

2011
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,280
the european court sets a lot of

2012
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,280
limitations on how you do that including

2013
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,080
that where it threatens the efficacy of

2014
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,920
the of the intelligence operation you

2015
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,560
don't have an obligation to disclose um

2016
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,800
and certain other limitations around um

2017
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,880
standing in access rights but it doesn't

2018
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,040
negate the possibility of this happening

2019
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,840
even in the most confusing intelligence

2020
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,320
contacts which is to say that at the

2021
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,800
baseline what the book is telling you is

2022
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
that we should avoid

2023
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,640
national security exceptionalism and

2024
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,880
mission creep to a point where none of

2025
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,960
this should ever be discussed the second

2026
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,920
we started talking military or war or

2027
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,640
conflict rather that we need to find out

2028
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,080
how we in a complex nuanced manner apply

2029
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,080
these standards in this unique way i'll

2030
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,520
just demonstrate to you that this is

2031
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,840
happening whether we want it or not in

2032
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
sram's one shrimps too

2033
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,760
in sram stew the court of justice of the

2034
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,440
european union has essentially compelled

2035
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,000
the u.s a country that has defended the

2036
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,679
idea that human rights do not apply

2037
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,440
exploratorially especially in the

2038
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,159
surveillance context has now compelled

2039
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,080
it in the new biden administration's

2040
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,560
framework agreement with the europeans

2041
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,880
to allow europeans for the first time

2042
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,840
ever

2043
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,400
to be able to go to courts in the us and

2044
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,360
ask

2045
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,360
to know what data about them has been

2046
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,520
collected who would have thought

2047
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,600
that kind of thing um

2048
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
if if applied and we're still waiting on

2049
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,600
the framework agreement to manifest an

2050
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,520
actual law but if applied it will be the

2051
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,320
biggest intelligence overall since

2052
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,400
watergate it would certainly be the

2053
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,199
first one to be compelled externally by

2054
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,879
a european court no less

2055
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,960
super

2056
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,120
thank you for thank you for the comments

2057
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,920
by the discussions as i've let's open

2058
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,719
the floor to questions to comments i can

2059
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,280
see that we have a hand

2060
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,800
here

2061
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,600
at the back

2062
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,640
thank you so much my name is aidar i'm

2063
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,440
from

2064
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,840
kalistan basically i want to ask a

2065
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,239
specific case in terms of in the context

2066
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,000
of ukraine and russia

2067
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,280
so uh on march 2nd

2068
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,280
some hackers attacked

2069
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,120
russian company called the andex

2070
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,600
specifically the service yandex food who

2071
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,000
which is a widely spread all across the

2072
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,159
region so across the russia belarus

2073
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,159
kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan as

2074
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,520
far as i remember

2075
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,000
so what happened there was a data leak

2076
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,960
of two million users their uh

2077
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,679
names home addresses and uh well

2078
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,840
basically delivered addresses uh

2079
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,920
personal emails and probably to some

2080
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,400
extent their banking information was

2081
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,280
linked

2082
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,880
to the general public

2083
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,080
uh in a huge sql database

2084
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,880
so

2085
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,640
uh but the perpetrators were not

2086
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,239
identified uh obviously so the question

2087
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,840
basically is what if this hack happened

2088
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,280
from uh originated from ukrainian

2089
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,159
uh

2090
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,320
ukrainians army cyber division for

2091
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,679
instance right

2092
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:38,480
uh

2093
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,000
would that hack fall into uh under the

2094
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,600
under the ihl

2095
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,560
because

2096
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,520
uh both in zeus and bellow principle and

2097
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,840
in ihl there is a

2098
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,400
principle of discrimination

2099
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,920
which basically says that you can attack

2100
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,000
only the targets of military necessity

2101
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,400
or the military target specifically and

2102
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,640
you should leave out the civilians uh

2103
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,120
out of the conflict in this case um what

2104
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,719
i'm asking is

2105
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,480
uh is this clear

2106
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,080
with the situation with personal debt of

2107
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,760
russian citizens but what if or what

2108
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,840
about the personal uh situation with the

2109
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,159
personal data of palestinian citizens

2110
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:19,679
uh would can we for instance uh

2111
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,280
ask from the uh see consider this as a

2112
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,239
violation of ihl or how would iho deal

2113
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,239
with the situation thank you i know that

2114
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,920
there's a chapter on this on about the

2115
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,920
third states and

2116
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,719
neutral states but still

2117
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,199
yeah thank you

2118
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,000
just we take the

2119
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
final questions thank you i think

2120
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,120
there's a phenomenal effort so

2121
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,719
congratulations to both of you for

2122
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,400
coordinating this and to the chapter

2123
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,719
contributors as well

2124
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,320
how would you respond to claims by

2125
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,400
states who say that you are now trying

2126
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,080
to bring privacy in through the backdoor

2127
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,679
by the universalization of certain

2128
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,600
rights

2129
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,000
in the ihl regime given that in the book

2130
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,679
borrows on conceptual linkages between

2131
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,199
both so you can now say that there is

2132
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,960
this clear separation once it goes into

2133
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,880
the agile regime it won't come back and

2134
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,800
related to that

2135
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,880
as you would know many civil society

2136
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,239
movements across the world in different

2137
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,520
countries are fighting for greater

2138
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,600
privacy protections if you are relying

2139
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,840
on state practice and opinion is to sort

2140
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,360
of come through to this in ihl

2141
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,880
reasonable to expect that you will get a

2142
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,080
set of minimum standards in the

2143
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,159
beginning wouldn't that have a reverse

2144
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,400
effect of undermining privacy movements

2145
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,360
across

2146
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,280
across different parts of the world

2147
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,120
where states will say look this is the

2148
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,800
iso protections that we agreed to after

2149
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,560
much negotiations you this is what you

2150
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,679
will get in national law as well

2151
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,719
so i don't want to hog the responses to

2152
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,480
either of those questions i will say a

2153
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,080
couple of things um

2154
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,880
uh

2155
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,120
in response to both of the questions

2156
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,960
that were asked first

2157
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,080
um

2158
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,000
eliza watts chapter was already

2159
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,560
mentioned and she does talk about

2160
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,719
the obligations to spare the civilians

2161
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,199
um and civilian um

2162
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,880
uh um um uh to spread civilians from um

2163
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,040
harms and military operations by the way

2164
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,280
that originally um would you just

2165
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,080
acknowledge in 2013 um

2166
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,480
another contributing author

2167
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,440
wrote

2168
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,800
an article in the international law

2169
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,360
study legal studies journal that had

2170
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,199
made the first argument around this but

2171
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,719
the point i'm trying to convey here is

2172
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,719
that there are certain linchpins within

2173
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,520
the existing um geneva conventions on

2174
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,920
which you can start to build theories

2175
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,360
and they will be theories there will be

2176
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,960
arguments they're not

2177
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,960
i can't give you lex lata to answer your

2178
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,080
question but theories on why it could be

2179
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,679
said that militaries have certain

2180
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,760
obligations as we talk military

2181
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,360
operations broader than just military

2182
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,199
attacks as was mentioned to spare

2183
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,120
civilian life spare from what from harms

2184
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,280
that are broader than just death and

2185
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,480
carnage um to start justifying certain

2186
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
due diligence obligations certain

2187
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,639
standards of protection cyber security

2188
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,560
uh when you're engaging in particular

2189
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
kinds of military operations by the way

2190
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,880
in peace time as in wartime and some of

2191
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,040
the chapters talk about that distinction

2192
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,719
but the reality is that a lot of what

2193
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,239
we're talking about we'll need to start

2194
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,239
in a peacetime stage

2195
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,199
as to have effects for wartime purposes

2196
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,120
which is another hard one because we're

2197
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,239
applying the ihl rules outside of an

2198
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,800
armed conflict context immediately

2199
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,199
but the point is that one can try and

2200
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,239
stretch rules within the conventions to

2201
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,840
cover these issues

2202
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,760
or one could try and build on human

2203
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,760
rights laws standing alone and existing

2204
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,480
alongside or in parallel or interpreting

2205
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,080
the rules to take into account those

2206
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,960
human rights frameworks and so i think

2207
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,880
that that goes also to the response to

2208
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,639
the second question which i think is

2209
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,120
valid and we've seen the second we

2210
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,840
militarize a conversation there might be

2211
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,600
opportunities for abuse and misuse of of

2212
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,880
that language and we're not here with

2213
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,360
this book to offer a definitive answer

2214
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,360
to any of the debates that we're

2215
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,560
highlighting

2216
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,400
it's the opposite if anything we're

2217
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,159
trying to highlight the debates because

2218
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,400
as you saw across this panel it's

2219
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,239
debates are not being had anywhere

2220
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,440
publicly

2221
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,880
i do think and that's what i'm trying to

2222
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,040
suggest to you they are being had

2223
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,840
internally within certain militaries and

2224
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,080
what we're hoping to do is just to flash

2225
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,840
the discussions out

2226
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,159
and then invite militaries to step in

2227
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,679
and say where

2228
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,679
what are the spectrum of opinions and i

2229
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,840
should say this is not new so data

2230
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,400
protection has been responsive the data

2231
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,719
protection law has been responsive first

2232
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,800
companies started to collect data and

2233
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
then government's responses to overuses

2234
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,440
mis

2235
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,440
abuses of data collection data

2236
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,280
processing with certain data protection

2237
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,760
standards in the same way this is can be

2238
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,400
a responsive action to what military's

2239
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,360
data invents it in invasive practices

2240
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,920
are demonstrating in real time and same

2241
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,000
goes also to the entire talent manual

2242
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,679
response at the end of the day talin

2243
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,880
manuel was one of the first massive

2244
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,280
articulations of the law here which led

2245
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,840
to governments then reacting

2246
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,280
challenging some of the arguments

2247
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,080
adopting others in a set of statements

2248
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,639
this kind of responsive and iterative

2249
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,440
process which led to talent manual 2.0

2250
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,440
now talent manual 3.0

2251
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,480
is the way you generate a conversation i

2252
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,960
think the same needs to happen in the

2253
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,639
space of some of the discussions that we

2254
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,639
have

2255
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,920
did you raise your hand yes i wanted to

2256
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,600
say two things as well in response to

2257
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,199
your question in particular i mean what

2258
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,440
i did try to say is that ihl does not

2259
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,520
provide the answer to your question i

2260
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,520
mean that's the bottom line that's what

2261
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,760
you know we've been trying to say so

2262
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,679
i i think there are two different issues

2263
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,239
one is the issue of whether data

2264
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,760
represents you know an object that is

2265
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,199
protected or not under the conduct of

2266
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,440
hostilities and the jury is out on that

2267
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,719
mike schmidt

2268
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,320
is the person to ask

2269
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,199
um

2270
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,800
my understanding is that the jury is

2271
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,400
still out and there are different views

2272
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,639
it's an unresolved question

2273
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,639
but the question you really ask i think

2274
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,960
is a question of data security you know

2275
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,120
cyber security excuse me the hack that

2276
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,920
you mentioned two million people etc ihl

2277
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,520
honestly does not deal

2278
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,199
with that at all so we have to look to

2279
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,880
other bodies of law

2280
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,800
but as i have the floor i'm going to hog

2281
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,159
it too

2282
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,760
just to respond to

2283
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,480
a self if i may because he touched a

2284
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,920
nerve which is my former icrc identity

2285
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,600
to say that i don't think that the

2286
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,120
chapter on the international

2287
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,679
organizations was quite fair

2288
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,000
for the following reasons um

2289
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,239
well one because

2290
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,520
speaking first of all the issue

2291
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,239
of

2292
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,960
whether again marco will be probably a

2293
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,800
better place than i to speak about this

2294
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,040
but the issue of does human rights law

2295
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,320
directly bind an international

2296
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,679
organization

2297
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,320
is really unres thank you marco is

2298
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,719
really unresolved and you uh took it as

2299
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,199
a given and it's not

2300
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,719
so um

2301
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,880
if you ask the united nations are you

2302
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,960
bound by ihl i mean i know this from an

2303
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,760
ihl point of view their answer is no

2304
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,000
i mean it will dip they are bound by the

2305
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,120
secretary general's bulletin on ihl from

2306
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,120
i can't remember the date now

2307
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,239
when the u.n is in command and control

2308
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,040
of

2309
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,120
for example peacekeeping missions with a

2310
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,280
robust mandate but that almost never

2311
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,800
happens

2312
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,360
so i mean look at the situation in haiti

2313
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,719
and the

2314
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,960
what was it the cholera if i'm not

2315
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,400
mistaken outbreak etc i mean there's no

2316
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,199
you

2317
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,760
it can't be taken as a given that they

2318
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,080
are bound by as a matter of law and most

2319
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,239
recently i read a very i thought

2320
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,080
interest very interesting article by

2321
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,920
noelle kenney

2322
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,520
who actually

2323
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,800
just recently maybe 10 days ago

2324
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,040
outlined all the theories on the basis

2325
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,440
of which people have said that

2326
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,679
international organizations may or may

2327
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,040
not be bound

2328
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,280
but none to my mind really reflects the

2329
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,159
practice of these organizations

2330
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,440
and the second thing i would say in

2331
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,280
relation to that is

2332
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,400
um

2333
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,400
international organizations

2334
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,520
yes including the icrc way preceded any

2335
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,800
militaries

2336
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,480
by coming out with their data protection

2337
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,199
handbooks vis-a-vis their

2338
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,920
beneficiaries so the handbook on

2339
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,760
humanitarian data protection and

2340
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,639
humanitarian action is like 400 pages

2341
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:45,679
and then

2342
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,280
which is a collective effort between the

2343
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,440
icrc and the belgian

2344
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,679
university think tank but

2345
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,080
encompassed a range of actors in its

2346
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,320
creation and then the icrc has a range

2347
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,400
of its own internal documents so to

2348
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,760
suggest that

2349
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,639
the organizations have been silent unhcr

2350
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,480
has one etc

2351
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,000
is not quite you know a fair critique

2352
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,920
um

2353
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,440
sorry and the last thing i wanted i

2354
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,199
guess and the last thing i wanted to say

2355
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,000
is

2356
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,080
with respect to the icrc of course to

2357
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,239
expect the icrc to be in the forefront

2358
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,639
of something that is not ihl but as a

2359
