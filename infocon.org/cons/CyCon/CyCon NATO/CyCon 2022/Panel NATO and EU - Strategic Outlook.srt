cyber dimension or the lack of thereof

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
in the strategic documents the new nato

strategic concept and the eu strategic

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
and the perspectives of nato eu

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,159
cooperation

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
in cyber or more generally so

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
christian if you wouldn't mind i turn to

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
you first

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,400
knowing that nato declared cyber as a

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
separate military domain

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,680
in 2016 at the warsaw summit

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560
um

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
yet um

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
according to the general public now

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,280
while of course this this group this

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
crowd here at cycon has talked a lot

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
about

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
the role of cyber in ukraine war but for

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
the general public very often there is

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
the notion that there is no cyber war in

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
ukraine

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
what would you say what role does nato

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,719
play in cyber in in in ukraine in the

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,758
war in ukraine and what does it mean for

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,800
the future of cyber measures in warfare

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
as expressed in the new strategic

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
concept

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,599
um thank you midler and good morning to

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,840
you all it's good to be back um in

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
person by the way

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
um i think the virtual thing well i

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,280
really didn't like it it's like eating

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
canned food i mean it fills your stomach

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
but it's not the real thing

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,640
so it's good to be sort of doing

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
business person to person

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
i'm also sort of cognizant of the fact

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
that we're we're coming really at the

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
tail end of the conference and lots of

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
interesting things have been said

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
so i feel kind of like i know what i

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,959
have to do the question is can i make it

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
interesting and i think that's the

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
challenge for the whole panel right

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
um now instead of the looking at looking

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
at nato looking at the strategic concept

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
the document of course is not out yet uh

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
it's being negotiated so i'm in a really

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
sort of nice position where i can

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
speculate about what it could be and and

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
what you perhaps would have

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,800
would find in the document and um

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
i'm sure there's going to be other other

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
colleagues that will also elaborate on

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
that but i think sort of um

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
having been a part of the the previous

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
document in 2010 i think when it comes

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
to cyber you have this sort of blurb

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
there that you know there are these sort

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
of cyber attacks that can affect

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
uh euro-atlantic stability and security

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
well obviously the world has changed

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,720
well um you don't find anything on china

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
for example in the last strategy concept

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,200
so so in many ways i think the the

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
question the challenge is going to be

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
how to make it fit for purpose how to

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
reflect what on one hand has taken place

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
and how to still sort of

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
um

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,599
think in relevant terms when it comes to

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
the next 10 years and i think there's

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
going to be we should expect some

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,599
continuity but also some change

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
i think what the uh what the action what

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
the what the war in ukraine tells you is

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,879
that the world use of force has not

108
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
disappeared it's still very much part of

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,680
the statecraft

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
um so the the collective defense the the

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
defense and deterrence mission if you

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
will of nato is is there to stay

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
uh unquestionably so um but i also think

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
the the second element of partnerships

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
um i don't really think that no one

116
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
however powerful can go it alone and i

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
think that's

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
that's very much part of the future as

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,399
well but but then there's this sort of

120
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
piece where uh that has been bothering

121
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,639
me uh for quite some time

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
uh even before the ukraine thing

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
happened and and that to me is the sort

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
of the notion that

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,000
quite often when you particularly when

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
you look at the technology and how it's

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
being used a lot is happening below the

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
threshold of the use of force

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
and i'm referring to

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
something that is not well you wouldn't

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
certainly sort of characterize this as

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
war certainly from a legal perspective

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
but it's also not peace

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,280
and i and i think this is relevant for

135
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,479
this conference when you look at

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
cyberspace which to me sort of contains

137
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
the free seas it's a it's a sort of

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
permanently contested domain it's

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
constantly on um and we shouldn't really

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
be looking at the incidents the um sort

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
of retrospectively i think it's sort of

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
the campaigns that occur over time so

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
it's the cumulative

144
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,600
aspects of the cumulative effects of it

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
what matters i think is that the sort of

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
the strategic competition piece not to

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
be not not peace not war i think some

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
have called it unpeace

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
and i think it's going to be a challenge

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
and that that challenge is going to be i

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
think similar but for the for the eu and

152
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,840
for nato and how to operate in that sort

153
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,759
of below the threshold scenarios where i

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,520
think many of the adversaries will be

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
designing their actions around the

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,639
turrets

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
uh so as to sort of affect um elements

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
of state power and and get what they

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,039
want without actually escalating or

160
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,039
going beyond you know above a certain

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,479
threshold

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,800
i also think looking ahead that a lot of

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
it a lot of that sort of strategic

164
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
competition will will focus on

165
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
technology

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
yes some of it is going to be about

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
these brilliant new technologies edt's

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
ai quantum post-quantum encryption and

169
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
what have you

170
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
but quite a lot of it is going to be a

171
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
run-of-the-mill the old sort of the way

172
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,080
of doing things so but but i think the

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,759
backbone the sort of where it's going to

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
play out is still the sort of the

175
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
technology so that's going to be at the

176
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,479
heart of it

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
so that's why i think the challenge is

178
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
going to be for both organizations of

179
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,880
how to still sort of sort of deliver

180
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
that commitment deliver that mandate

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
that we have

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
part of it is having to do with

183
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
resilience indeed deterrence by denial

184
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
making sure that um

185
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
you're able to sort of continue business

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
after sustaining the blow

187
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,919
but i think there's still something

188
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,520
missing and that is the sort of not only

189
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
the deterrence of you know by denial

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,199
peace but also the imposition of costs

191
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
and and we've been going in that

192
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
direction you've seen the attribution

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
statements you've seen the expressions

194
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
of solidarity

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
um but i think sort of more can be done

196
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
i will sort of be intellectually honest

197
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
um sort of having listened to general

198
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,280
microsoft's remarks

199
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
sort of my thinking sort of tends to go

200
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
uh very much in the same direction when

201
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
it comes to persistent engagement

202
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
or sort of

203
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
joint publication 3-12 right i mean it's

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
it's the ability to degrade and create

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
these sort of strategic dilemmas also

206
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
for our adversaries that does not

207
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
necessarily sort of escalate to the

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
level of war

209
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
but that is something that one can and

210
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
arguably should be doing in order to

211
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
defend really sort of

212
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
not only the cyber space but also the

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
the values-based world that that we want

214
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
to still occupy

215
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,680
so i think continuity and change going

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
forward um very much sort of similar

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
challenges and i think the sort of the

218
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,479
golden golden word here is going to be

219
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
not necessarily sort of duplication of

220
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,919
effort but complementarity i think the

221
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
two organizations fit nicely

222
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
nato's core competence i would argue

223
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
will still remain securely on defense

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,039
question is

225
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
how to make it relevant in all of these

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
decisions i think we have a lot to learn

227
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
from what happened with the 5g

228
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
thank you thank you christian you've uh

229
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
very eloquently put uh

230
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
about what we could expect in the

231
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
strategic concept i i would however like

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
to tear out of you the the rule that you

233
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,360
yeah on your your view that nato has

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
been playing in the war in ukraine could

235
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
you comment that a little bit too

236
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,199
well there's nato as an organization of

237
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,120
course and there i mean what you've seen

238
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,479
is the public announcement when it comes

239
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,000
to sort of giving ukraine access to the

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
malware information sharing a platform

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
etc but i think i'd like to think of

242
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
nato in broader terms i'd like to think

243
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
of nato as an alliance and their allies

244
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,039
have done a lot

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
um i would also like to sort of sort of

246
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
go back to what i said when it comes to

247
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
cyber i think what is important

248
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,720
is sort of the way we think of cyber

249
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
and in many ways i would say that what

250
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
happened on the 24th of february was

251
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,599
really sort of the a culmination

252
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
while the cyber action in ukraine has

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
been taking a place for a very long time

254
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
ukraine has gotten

255
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,839
not only used to it but has learned a

256
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
lot of lessons and and knows how to

257
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
defend itself so allied role um be that

258
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
sort of by training and education but

259
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
also capabilities and assisting

260
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
ukrainians themselves to defend their

261
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
cyberspace i think has been significant

262
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
um

263
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
a big part of i think why why some are

264
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,080
saying that

265
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
um there hasn't been this sort of

266
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,160
shock and awe or like a digital per

267
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,040
harbor

268
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
i think it is having to do with exactly

269
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
that

270
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
uh that it's not i mean i mean to me

271
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
when i look at cyber i mean i i do not

272
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,399
want to subject this to the same level

273
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
of scrutiny as as the sort of

274
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
a conventional domain or as the nuclear

275
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
domain i think cyber has its own special

276
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
characteristics that need to be taken

277
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,399
into account but nato's role in this

278
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
regard i think in

279
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
quite often has been to enable uh to to

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
sort of enable ukrainians themselves to

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
do the job that they do they know their

282
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
networks better and of course once again

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,279
allies

284
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,120
and then also sort of the the private

285
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
industry where nato quite often has been

286
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,519
only the sort of perhaps a facilitator

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,080
and not necessarily the first responder

288
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
well thank you for that and and uh i'm

289
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
looking into digging in more deeply in

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
some of the concepts that you mentioned

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,519
here um as as uh in the

292
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
through the course of this panel but

293
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
steven turning to you and turning to eu

294
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,720
what role does cyber play in the eu's

295
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,600
strategic concept and and how well would

296
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
you

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
say is eu prepared

298
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
to for cyber attacks following the

299
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
russian invasion in ukraine

300
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,600
thank you maryland good morning thanks

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
for having me first time here at scicon

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,040
so uh very excited to be here what i can

303
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
offer i think is a bit of a more general

304
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,200
perspective on eu security and defense

305
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
and how cyber fits into that and i think

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
since 2016 broadly the eu has

307
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
consistently developed a number of

308
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
instruments and tools in the field of

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
security and defense

310
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
to strengthen defense planning

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
industrial cooperation civilian crisis

312
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
management but also the fight against

313
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,079
hybrid threats and of course the fight

314
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
against cyber threats and strengthening

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
cyber defense has been an integral part

316
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
of that

317
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
with the cyber diplomacy toolbox being

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
developed since 2017

319
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,839
different iterations of a cyber security

320
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,399
strategy the last one dated from 2020

321
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
and also a cyber defense policy

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,120
framework a new one coming up later this

323
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
year i'll revert to that a bit later

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
on the 21st of march we have adopted the

325
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,079
strategic compass and i'm in the

326
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
comfortable position to actually refer

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to you to the document it's available

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
online i highly recommend it it's a very

329
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
reasonable document perhaps contrary to

330
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
usual eu talk it's also a very

331
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,120
actionable document because each and

332
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
every chapter ends with a number of

333
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
action boxes and timeline and describes

334
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
what needs to be done

335
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,800
the compass is in itself another

336
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
reaction to ukraine i think it's

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
important to note we started work on

338
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,240
that two years back and it clearly

339
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,040
builds on everything that has been done

340
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,519
but of course it integrates the

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,000
events since the 24th of february the

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
compass in itself is not focused

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
exclusively on cyber in fact it's a lot

344
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
more broader it offers a

345
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,720
really

346
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
the comprehensive strategic perspective

347
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
and everything that needs to be done in

348
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
the field of security and defense but

349
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,480
cyborg is clearly a very important part

350
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
of it and i did a little search

351
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
yesterday evening i found the word cyber

352
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
82 times in the compass and it's a

353
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
little over 40 pages so i think that's a

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,959
good

355
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,399
illustration of the fact that the

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
compass clearly recognizes cyber as one

357
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
of the contested strategic domains

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
clearly labeling actions by russia by

359
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,519
china also north korea and iran as part

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,760
of a threat analysis and then developing

361
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
a number of actions that we that we

362
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
propose over the next five to ten years

363
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
i'll perhaps briefly run through them in

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,399
terms of what we believe needs to be

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,200
done

366
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
first and foremost

367
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,399
rules

368
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
we believe it is essential to maintain

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
an open free stable and secure

370
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
cyberspace and we will continue to

371
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
promote uh rules and international norms

372
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
for responsible style state behavior in

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,639
this regard as one of the other

374
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
speakers said yesterday the rules based

375
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
international orders

376
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
is ours to lose and i would say it's

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
ours to build and that certainly will be

378
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
a key part of our effort from the eu

379
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
side going ahead

380
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
we need to increase situational

381
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
awareness stimulate information exchange

382
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
and cooperation between our intelligence

383
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
agencies between our cyber security

384
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
agencies and perhaps there is scope

385
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
there to increase our cooperation with

386
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,839
nato as well

387
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
we have just developed the eu cyber

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
posture

389
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
signaling our determination to provide

390
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
immediate long-term and tailored

391
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,639
responses to threat actors

392
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
we're also looking into strengthening

393
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
the different measures we have available

394
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
as part of our eu cyber diplomacy

395
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,639
toolbox including possible additional

396
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
response measures and sanctions

397
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
so far you know that the toolbox has

398
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,680
been used almost 20 times most recently

399
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
on the 10th of may

400
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
with the targeted and coordinated

401
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,040
attribution of the ksat attack by russia

402
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
exercises also a key part of our efforts

403
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
we we concluded earlier this year

404
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
together with the french presidency of

405
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
the council

406
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
a scenario based cycles exercise and i

407
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
think these are very valuable in terms

408
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
of increasing our readiness in in terms

409
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,279
of

410
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,519
lessons learned and also

411
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
through the parallel and coordinated

412
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
exercises with nato we can test our

413
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
coordinated responses and link them up

414
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
with the other crisis management tools

415
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,399
we have available at the eu level

416
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
including article 42.7 the mutual

417
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
assistance clause

418
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,519
we need to support our civilian csdp our

419
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
military csdp missions and operations

420
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
worldwide their cybersecurity needs to

421
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
be strengthened

422
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,399
and of course linked to that we need to

423
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,519
support partners a lot more in terms of

424
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
their resilience thinking of georgia

425
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
moldova ukraine obviously but also the

426
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,480
western balkans

427
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
later this year as i said and this is

428
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
one of the key components or key

429
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
proposals in the strategic compass we

430
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
will put forward the new eu cyber

431
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,519
defense policy framework

432
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,120
and i think what you will see there is

433
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
that this will set out our vision for

434
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
the next five to ten years in terms of

435
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
priority areas key deliverables on all

436
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
the topics that i've just mentioned and

437
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,639
perhaps

438
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,240
it would be a pleasure for me to come

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
back next year and talk to you in a bit

440
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
more detail about that cyber defense

441
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
policy framework

442
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,519
turning very quickly to the capability

443
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
side because of course that's also very

444
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,959
important

445
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,880
we have we will try to leverage the

446
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
different tools we have at eu level the

447
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
european defense funds to permanent

448
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,600
structure cooperation to stimulate joint

449
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,399
development uh procurement even of of

450
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
the necessary capabilities while

451
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
stimulating the eu's industrial and

452
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,199
technological base

453
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
um as you will have seen the eu council

454
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
the european council met earlier this

455
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
week our heads of state and government

456
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
adopted a set of conclusions including

457
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,440
on security and defense and they have

458
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
actually discussed the report on defense

459
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
investment gaps and what needs to be

460
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
done in the wake of the russian invasion

461
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
of ukraine to strengthen our capacities

462
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
across the board but it also has some

463
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
very interesting

464
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
comments on

465
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,800
cyber

466
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
including the need to strengthen rc2

467
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
situational awareness exercises but also

468
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,000
full spectrum cyber capabilities

469
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
the quote may be on in the pesco

470
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,079
framework as well we have the cyber

471
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
rapid response teams has been a very

472
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
successful project is led by by

473
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
lithuania perhaps we will revert to that

474
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
later as well because it's important in

475
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
the context of what we've been doing in

476
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,800
ukraine

477
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
as well

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
lastly partners an essential part as

479
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
well of the uh of the strategic compass

480
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
nato by the way is quoted i think 30

481
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,079
times in the documents we uh we

482
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
look forward to see how the strategic

483
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
concept will reflect uh the nato's

484
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
relationship with the eu but from our

485
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
side this is a key strategic partnership

486
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
that needs to be further developed cyber

487
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,240
is part and parcel of that since 2016.

488
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
there is scope to do more including on

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,079
edts including on innovation research

490
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
capacities

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and we look forward to taking that

492
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,359
forward after the madrid summit so all

493
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,760
in all a lot of work in the next five to

494
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,439
ten years and uh look forward to

495
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
discussing that further with you indeed

496
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,880
thanks very much thanks for the thanks

497
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,359
for that wolfgang i turn to you and to

498
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,559
the uh european defense agency eda

499
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,199
what is its role in cyber what is its

500
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,039
vision about cyber and how do you

501
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
interact with both nato and eu yes

502
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
thanks a lot

503
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
and uh steen uh already gave me all the

504
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,840
hooks for for my intervention uh because

505
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
he mentioned all the different

506
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
initiatives uh

507
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
in place at the moment but before i will

508
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
go into this actual uh situation of

509
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,600
today i want to do a little uh a look

510
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
back because one one of the things is

511
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
about 10 years ago i had the opportunity

512
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
and chance to build up the cyber defense

513
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
program in the agency from the scratch

514
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,440
and i was really sitting 10 years ago in

515
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
front of a blank sheet of paper how

516
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
should such a program could look like

517
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,679
and

518
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,640
one of the first lines i drew at that

519
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
time on this blank sheet of paper was

520
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
for sure already the cooperation and

521
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
dialogue with nato because i was myself

522
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
working for nato before therefore that

523
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
was for me from the eu side a given

524
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
thing from the beginning and um

525
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,080
as they already mentioned since 2016 a

526
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
lot of changes have taken place

527
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
and here i want to dwell on

528
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,039
this what was mentioned already from the

529
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,280
capability development perspective

530
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,600
because that red and butter business of

531
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,919
the agency to support member states and

532
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
capability development in the entire

533
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
spectrum of defense capabilities and

534
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,760
2011 2012 cyber defense came on this

535
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,960
agenda with a revision of the capability

536
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
development plan

537
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,520
and uh here

538
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
now looking into today

539
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
i also have here the the reference to

540
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,200
the different

541
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
defense initiatives starting with pasco

542
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,320
uh the permanent structured corporation

543
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,160
as one of these initiatives after the

544
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
global strategy in 2016.

545
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
uh

546
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
it's it's an uh instrument with a high

547
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,080
polit uh political visibility and this

548
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,440
uh is uh very advancing our

549
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
four

550
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
capability development we have nowadays

551
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,320
60

552
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
pesco projects in place of which five

553
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
are cyber related the lithuanian that

554
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
already mentioned but there are also

555
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
other projects which

556
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,440
will

557
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,320
in the long term

558
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
contribute to improving the the

559
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,679
capability landscape in europe

560
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,480
then

561
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
over to another initiative

562
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
coming out of the same time frame the

563
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
so-called coordinated annual revenue on

564
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
defense card so this gives us an

565
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
instrument with which we in a two-year

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
cycle

567
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,320
can make an assessment how have

568
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
capabilities developed in europe in

569
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,880
european member states so we are doing

570
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
this dialogue with member states every

571
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,280
two years to really look

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
where is progress

573
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,520
where is not so much progress and uh uh

574
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
already mentioned also by staying are

575
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
for sure also the initiatives which uh

576
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
have been launched by the commission the

577
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,840
european uh defense fund with its uh two

578
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,360
precursor initiatives

579
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
on the one hand side the prepter action

580
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
for defense-related research and

581
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,159
the european defense industrial

582
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
development program edidp

583
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,919
this is for the first time that defense

584
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,440
and also cyber defense has access to uh

585
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,559
eu common funding this is a really a

586
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,120
novelty and when we look into the

587
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,480
situation when it started in 2017

588
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,919
to the outlook 2027

589
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
there will be out of the eu common

590
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
funding around 9 billion euros available

591
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
for defense capability development i

592
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
think this is a good incentive for

593
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
member states to do more together

594
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
because that is one of

595
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
the mantras

596
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
of uh this

597
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
and uh

598
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,919
in today's situation at the moment three

599
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,840
uh projects are uh

600
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,000
benefiting cyber projects are benefiting

601
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
from the edidp so the precursor program

602
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
with a volume of about 27 millions and

603
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
we are at the moment waiting for the

604
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
results of the first

605
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,280
edf call from last year and here we can

606
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
also expect that major

607
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
projects will come up

608
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
with a cyber reference so out of the

609
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
call there is a roughly

610
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
23 33 millions available for cyber

611
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,720
topics

612
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,679
and

613
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,120
now uh with that the bigger landscape i

614
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
want to drill down a little bit on two

615
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
projects which are currently run in the

616
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,559
agency that is on the one hand side uh i

617
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,360
would say a structural project for

618
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,159
establishing a a network of military

619
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
thirds

620
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
everybody would expect oh this should be

621
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,760
already exist no that's not the case and

622
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
uh here we have to foster the

623
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,600
cooperation

624
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
between the member states and their

625
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
military search because they are one of

626
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,039
the key operational capabilities

627
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,320
when really massive attacks will hit

628
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,280
armed forces being it a home based or

629
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,720
being it in operations so uh i think

630
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
this is one of the key uh projects which

631
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
is referencing back to

632
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,360
the latest cyber security strategy so uh

633
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,480
here we are putting uh effort so for

634
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,360
example we started this with an eda uh a

635
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,159
funded product uh project the so-called

636
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,320
milcert interoperability conference

637
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
where we will do next week another

638
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,520
iteration the strategic trek with

639
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
the heads of milcert to discuss the

640
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
results of an exercise we did earlier

641
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,120
this year with uh the milsard community

642
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
and another

643
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,840
project i want to mention here is

644
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,039
one of the edip projects where we were

645
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,120
asked by the contributing members who

646
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
won this

647
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
project that we do for them the project

648
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,600
management and this is also from my

649
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
point of view a project which

650
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
hits into our uh uh

651
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
points to the future because that's a

652
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,120
project for the development of a

653
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,520
european cyber security cyber awareness

654
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,159
platform ecip

655
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,440
which has

656
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
a history in the agency so we started

657
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
some years ago developing an initial

658
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,360
architecture for such a project then

659
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,919
this was picked up by a handful of

660
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,279
member states for a follow-on project to

661
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,200
develop here a

662
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
research prototype and now the current

663
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,120
uh

664
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,440
project which is benefiting

665
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,480
roughly 18 million euros from the edidp

666
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,120
aims to develop here an operational

667
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
demonstrator so

668
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,080
this shows clearly the development over

669
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
time from

670
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
an initial idea over research

671
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,360
into an operational capacity and i think

672
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
this is one of the things and i want to

673
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
stop with these two examples i could

674
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
name here many more about how to create

675
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
impact here with such kind of capability

676
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
development projects to

677
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
shape the future in cyber defense

678
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
because one of the things even if we

679
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,720
think we are good we can always get

680
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
better and this is part of getting

681
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
better thank you thank you wolfgang it's

682
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
great to see how

683
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
how confirmed and positive you are about

684
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,039
it it feels like if you are so

685
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
enthusiastic about it good things will

686
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
happen in eda

687
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
um

688
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
recognizing that there are so many of us

689
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
uh marches

690
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,039
i turn to you

691
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
um

692
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,400
as as christian early earlier said nato

693
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
ultimately is at the hand of its allies

694
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
you are a nato ally eu member state as

695
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,480
well but but mostly looking at nato what

696
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
would you say how well is nato

697
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
ready

698
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,000
to

699
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,120
tackle the challenges posed by in cyber

700
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,919
uh

701
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
from an allied perspective also two

702
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,600
weeks ago nato cyber coordinators met in

703
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,039
brussels

704
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,919
you are the one to go to these meetings

705
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,600
from vilnius

706
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,559
what

707
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,320
do you want to make out of that format

708
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
please tell us

709
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
okay thanks first

710
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,840
i appreciate the possibility to be here

711
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
it's the first time for for me i envy

712
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,880
those uh who spend three days uh maybe

713
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,480
next time i should come

714
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,520
and and plan you know a bit more time to

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
really participate in all those

716
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,279
discussions and i'll come back to your

717
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,799
question on nato but i think first

718
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,279
i think first it is important to say

719
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
that the very good starting point for

720
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
our discussion is is what is happening

721
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
now in in ukraine

722
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
and you know your your first question

723
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,720
was uh was about that i believe that uh

724
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,039
you know in in all different panels

725
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,240
people were

726
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
you know despite what topic was on the

727
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,559
panel where you know going back to the

728
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,640
ukraine because it is important i think

729
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,919
you know

730
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,640
everyone sees a very brutal

731
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
a very you know conventional 20 20th

732
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,240
century type war in in in ukraine

733
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
and you rightly said that maybe in in

734
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,400
public it's not that visible what is

735
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,640
happening in cyber but i i would say you

736
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,919
know from

737
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
you know from my contacts with with

738
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,440
ukrainians and i'm from you know

739
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
contacts

740
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,039
with people who are closely you know

741
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,760
observe investigation i think uh what we

742
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,120
see there is is a full-fledged cyber war

743
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,559
not only because of unprecedented scale

744
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,799
although not not very visible but but

745
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,080
also some

746
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,159
some some sophistication

747
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,880
so definitely you know first we should

748
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
help ukraine to win also in in that

749
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,399
domain

750
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
but also i think what is important we

751
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,399
have to you know learn

752
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,399
lessons ukraine lessons together you

753
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,960
know together with ukrainians you know

754
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
what when i say we i mean you and and

755
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,000
and nato

756
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
second

757
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,880
i think uh it is important to uh to

758
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
clearly say that cyber should be and

759
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
should be an important part of his

760
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,679
long-term adaptation you know nato is

761
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,080
ongoing uh thinking and and you know

762
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
madrid summit will be an important uh

763
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,679
milestone in in in setting uh

764
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,919
the direction for the nato long-term

765
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,120
adaptation

766
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,880
on on the you know

767
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
conventional site

768
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,000
on or on on on kinetic site of course we

769
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
are talking about you know moving to

770
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,840
forward forward defense to really

771
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
changing a nato posture

772
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
but the main question what does it mean

773
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
for for cyber you know what does forward

774
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,120
defense what does new

775
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,960
new nato uh

776
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,279
defense position mean for

777
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
for cyber i think that is that the main

778
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,760
question we have to to answer

779
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
and

780
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
you know i i see that you're trying to

781
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,200
you know to bring me you know to this

782
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
nato uh

783
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
topic only but but i think you know

784
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,960
coming from from you know country which

785
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
is you and you and nato

786
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
and i will

787
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
you know share some some of the ideas

788
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,520
which i i think we should we should

789
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,200
focus in in the future

790
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
but we are uh as as relevant uh you know

791
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,120
to to nato eu but also for national uh

792
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,159
cyber capacity capacity building

793
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,080
so first

794
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
and i'm surprised that i haven't heard

795
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,080
this from my colleagues panelists this

796
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
public private partnership which has has

797
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
been

798
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
you know discussed i think in the

799
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,679
context of ukraine uh very uh very often

800
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,320
uh recently and uh i i really agree that

801
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,879
it is a

802
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,919
probably a a momentum where

803
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,000
we you know we see

804
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,679
it differently

805
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,120
but there is a

806
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
momentum to move forward on on

807
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
increasing this public-private

808
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
partnership you know

809
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
private companies were very quick to

810
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
help ukraine

811
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
uh they were very proactive in sharing

812
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,360
uh ensuring the intelligence and i think

813
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,640
you know we should

814
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
really

815
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
taking this ad hoc uh you know mechanism

816
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
we are developing now we should think

817
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,440
how to make them uh more structured

818
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
into you know turn into more structured

819
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,399
dialogue

820
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,279
um

821
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
but i think what is and there is but

822
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
there is one caveat here i think we

823
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
should not uh understand you know this

824
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,039
dialogue as

825
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
as uh

826
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
that we want to outsource some of the

827
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,399
capabilities i think it is important

828
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,279
that

829
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
you know our public-private partnership

830
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,240
is a complementary to to what we do on

831
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
on national base what we do on

832
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
multinational basis and how we develop

833
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
our capabilities so it's complementary

834
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,960
uh we we should not

835
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,840
rely only on on on private uh and i

836
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
think what what is important also to

837
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,720
stress

838
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,399
uh that

839
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
it is working and it is a

840
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
you know very interesting model for the

841
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,520
future

842
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,440
because it's not about selling buying

843
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
you know type of relationship i think

844
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
everyone understands and when it comes

845
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,559
to ukraine what's happening here there

846
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,399
are much bigger things at stake and

847
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
everyone has to contribute

848
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,559
you know to really

849
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,399
solving that

850
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,279
second second issue which

851
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,279
has been already mentioned

852
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,760
with uh referring to lithuanian cyber

853
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,679
rapid response

854
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,519
teams project

855
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,960
uh but i think uh also if if we if we

856
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
read the european documents recent

857
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,399
documents

858
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,279
uh about creating joint cyber unit and

859
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,000
and rapid response capacities

860
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
in in nato also you know discussions and

861
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,559
i'm glad that u.s is leading discussions

862
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
on you know virtual cyber rapid response

863
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
teams and and so on and i'm glad that

864
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
lithuania with some of the member states

865
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,240
which are also represented

866
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
you know netherlands uh also also

867
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,919
estonia we have been you know ahead of

868
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
his discussion five years ago when we

869
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,080
established that cyber rapid response

870
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
project

871
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,840
and in in five years we have reached a

872
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,559
full operational capability we have

873
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,720
you know clearly defined the profiles we

874
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,720
need to have in both teams we have

875
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
developed procedures

876
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,399
we have done many training

877
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,679
trainings together uh we have identified

878
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,519
interoperable tools which is important

879
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,440
and we we are ready to share those

880
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,519
voices that experience it which we

881
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,080
developed in a multilateral framework

882
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,039
with eu nato and uh

883
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,240
definitely

884
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
you know

885
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
this is a secure resource and uh you

886
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
know it showed the you know ukraine

887
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
situation showed

888
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,159
all

889
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,279
different uh you know scenarios which

890
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,000
talk about some spillover effects uh you

891
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
know from ukraine clearly indicates that

892
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,120
we need to develop that that capacity at

893
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,039
multinational level not only you know

894
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,159
national

895
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,200
uh

896
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,640
it can help to

897
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
to manage incidents it can it can

898
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,760
it can also be useful in resilience uh

899
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
testing uh

900
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,159
and penetration testing it it can really

901
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,399
be helpful in supporting partners as in

902
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,799
the case of of of ukraine and some i

903
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
some are sometimes here but maybe this

904
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,760
is a duplication between you and nato so

905
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,000
i would say that in this in this context

906
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,039
uh

907
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,120
you know there is there is probably not

908
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,240
too many

909
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
you know of cyber teams it cannot be too

910
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,360
many cyber cyber rapid response teams

911
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,840
so uh it is again a complementary uh i

912
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,399
would see it as a complementary what

913
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,200
what we are doing nationally on

914
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,320
multinational level eu and nato the

915
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,600
third

916
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
uh

917
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
that is resilience building was was

918
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,039
mentioned but i would like to uh to look

919
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,760
into into it through um through the

920
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,679
lenses of

921
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,559
mandatory versus uh

922
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,159
you know voluntary

923
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
you know standards requirements and so

924
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,279
on i think that that is a momentum where

925
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,960
we should really you know move from

926
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,279
voluntary type of of discussions it

927
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,120
would be nice to have if it would be

928
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,239
nice if someone would do that to really

929
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,320
you know setting someone data standards

930
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,520
both

931
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,719
in eu and

932
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,320
and and nato

933
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,599
we are doing at some extent that in in

934
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,320
both uh but uh but i think we definitely

935
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
have a good instruments to

936
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,520
to to go to go further in on nato site

937
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,760
we have uh cyber defense pledge which

938
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,719
can can really be a tool to to to set

939
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,639
someone mandatory standards we have

940
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,199
defense spending benchmarks

941
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,918
why not to have uh cyber security you

942
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,199
know benchmarks on on nato side when it

943
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,879
comes to eu

944
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,119
we are now talking a lot about uh you

945
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,159
know digital and investing into into

946
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,679
digital but why why not to have a cyber

947
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,399
security you know uh

948
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,280
percentage dedicated percentage how much

949
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
you should spend on cyber security when

950
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,440
you develop digital programs and so on

951
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,400
we are all struggling nationally to do

952
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
to do that but

953
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,560
but

954
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,119
the the collective collective effort i

955
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
think would would be

956
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,680
much more efficient

957
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
and um

958
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,160
i will probably you know respond to to

959
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,320
to your to your question which you post

960
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,079
in the end about uh

961
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,280
both national cyber uh coordinators

962
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,359
meetings in nato i think that is you

963
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,720
know what what nato has started is

964
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,560
a very good

965
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
direction to go

966
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,880
i think it is a very good direction for

967
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
for nato

968
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
uh because definitely nato when it comes

969
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
to cyber should go beyond nato nato

970
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
networks

971
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
and if

972
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
if you have uh around the table national

973
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,599
uh cyber coordinators definitely this

974
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,839
discussion goes beyond nato networks

975
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,680
because all those people are coming with

976
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,720
uh

977
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,680
much

978
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,920
bigger responsibilities for national

979
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,520
responsibilities and

980
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,960
much bigger uh you know focus so i think

981
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,200
that is a very prospective way

982
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,280
uh to help nato to

983
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
to to do more

984
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
beyond the nato networks it also a good

985
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,839
tool because i think the common uh

986
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,320
common topic here is also what u nato

987
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,560
could do together so bringing those

988
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,040
national coordinates with

989
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,560
responsibilities on on the u nato side

990
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,839
also helps to

991
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,480
uh to to achieve uh com com

992
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,320
complementarity so i will probably stop

993
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
uh stop here and uh ready for the

994
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,560
discussion thanks well thank you for

995
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,119
this very very intelligent and and and

996
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,040
uh deep look into uh a set of things

997
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,000
from your national perspective uh lisa

998
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
klopp how would you um complement that

999
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
um

1000
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,800
how well as you see it from the

1001
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,920
perspective of netherlands is eu as well

1002
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,480
as nato dealing with the cyber security

1003
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,760
challenge and and what's more

1004
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,480
there to do for the years to come

1005
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,359
through the new different strategic

1006
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
documents

1007
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
well thank you and also from my side

1008
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,839
pleasure to be here and i've been very

1009
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,680
much enjoying the conference so far and

1010
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
i hope after your breakfast at least

1011
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
it's good to see such a nice full of

1012
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,880
room at the final part of this

1013
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
conference

1014
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,160
um it's a

1015
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,839
subject that's very dear to my heart

1016
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,119
being

1017
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,560
from a nation that was one of the

1018
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,440
founding nations of both nato and eu

1019
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,520
and when it comes about the challenge

1020
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,640
that cyber poses to eu and its member

1021
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
states to a large extent the same threat

1022
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
that naso is facing

1023
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,119
however we have to be mindful of the

1024
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
different mandate both organizations

1025
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
have the eu was born out of economic

1026
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
cooperation and is an organization with

1027
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,680
soft power tools as a regulator

1028
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
and nato of course is created for

1029
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,320
political military cooperation with hard

1030
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,599
power tools so the different mandate

1031
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,000
both organizations have

1032
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
means that a response from either of the

1033
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,720
organizations is perceived differently

1034
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,000
and this is something that the

1035
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
netherlands is a member of both

1036
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,160
always carefully assesses when we are

1037
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,440
working on

1038
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,599
trying to see how we want to respond or

1039
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
if there is a need to respond

1040
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,320
and the eu is prepared to tackle the

1041
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,560
challenges malicious cyber activities

1042
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
post through the eu cyber diplomacy

1043
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
toolbox as mentioned by stein

1044
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,560
it's underlining that the eu is ready to

1045
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,200
respond to external cyber threats

1046
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
that cause malicious significant impact

1047
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,040
or systemic

1048
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,280
effect on the eu with a range of

1049
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,000
measures including sanctions and

1050
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,480
this framework for joint eu diplomatic

1051
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,920
response is part of the eu's approach

1052
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
to cyber diplomacy and it contributes to

1053
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,640
conflict prevention the mitigation of

1054
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,480
cyber security threats

1055
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
greater stability in international

1056
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,440
relations

1057
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,480
and

1058
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,839
we feel that the framework has

1059
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,160
encouraged cooperation facilitated in

1060
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
mitigation of immediate and long-term

1061
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
threats and also intends to influence

1062
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
the behavior of potential aggressors in

1063
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
the long term

1064
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
of course there it's very hard to

1065
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,280
justify and measure your impact

1066
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,359
but in 2020 the eu came out with

1067
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,440
declarations condemning malicious cyber

1068
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
activity for instance on the cyber

1069
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,400
attack against georgia

1070
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,119
but we also imposed the first sanctions

1071
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,839
under the eu's sanction regime

1072
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,520
and the netherlands was one of the

1073
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,240
driving forces behind both the toolbox

1074
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,720
as well as the sanctions regime and one

1075
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,440
of the reasons for our determination to

1076
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,599
be able to have a strong response

1077
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,000
was the attempted cyber attack

1078
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,520
by the russian gru to the opcw in the

1079
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,400
hague in 2018

1080
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
another reason for our determination is

1081
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,400
our strong belief in values and values

1082
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,319
have been one of the returning elements

1083
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,000
in multiple sessions throughout the

1084
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,280
conference and rightfully so

1085
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,079
it's part of our commitment to achieve

1086
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,400
an open free stable and secure

1087
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
cyberspace

1088
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,720
and hence before the publication of the

1089
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,119
eu cybersecurity strategy the

1090
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,720
netherlands in conversations with the

1091
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
eas and other member states

1092
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,079
highlighted our priorities and focus on

1093
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,920
on

1094
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,760
both values but also on other issues

1095
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,359
where we felt the eu should be doing

1096
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,480
more

1097
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,720
and one of these being

1098
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,200
the intersection of economic security

1099
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,640
and cyber and critical infrastructure

1100
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
secondly

1101
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,040
intellectual property theft and thirdly

1102
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,119
disinformation and

1103
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,240
um cyber security strategy came out at

1104
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,640
the end of 2020 and

1105
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
i think a lot of you will recognize that

1106
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
ever since that need to be increasing

1107
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,119
our focus on these issues has only

1108
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,319
increased

1109
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,680
um

1110
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
and the eu's

1111
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
cyber security strategy was one of the

1112
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,319
guided documents also in assuring that

1113
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,240
cyber was mainstreamed throughout the eu

1114
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,119
um supported by the horizontal working

1115
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,200
party on cyber issues

1116
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
that advises the council

1117
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,599
both on internal cyber threats as well

1118
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,240
as

1119
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,599
external

1120
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,119
issues so it works with both the eas

1121
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,880
where stein is the representative from

1122
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,680
but also with a commission

1123
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,640
and the strategic compass that stan just

1124
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,800
spoke about will take our work further

1125
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
and it's the document that's been

1126
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
addressing areas where we now need to

1127
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,560
focus on and

1128
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,880
in view of the current trends

1129
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,960
but it in our view also is a document

1130
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,200
that starts to fill out sort of the gray

1131
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,319
area between the eu and nato

1132
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,599
and

1133
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,880
um

1134
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,720
one of the first documents that actually

1135
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,680
brought the work of the compass further

1136
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
was last week's publication of the cyber

1137
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,040
posture

1138
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,000
um the posture aims to demonstrate eu's

1139
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,319
determination to provide immediate and

1140
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,040
long-term responses to flat actors

1141
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,599
seeking to deny the eu a secure and open

1142
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,839
access to cyberspace

1143
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,319
and affect its strategic incident

1144
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,319
interests including the security of its

1145
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,520
partners

1146
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,760
so also there in those sort of

1147
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,800
statements um and documents the eu is

1148
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,640
clearly signaling

1149
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
how much we attach

1150
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,480
to be working to advance our values but

1151
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,160
also to be working um with our partners

1152
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,240
nato being one of the first uh and

1153
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,920
foremost

1154
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
and in the world where our adversaries

1155
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
are trying to undermine our unity to

1156
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
spread this information

1157
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,640
and um

1158
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,599
are aggressive against all of us the

1159
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,280
netherlands is a strong believer in the

1160
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
power of a joint response

1161
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,000
and the fact that declarations on cyber

1162
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,079
incidents at solarwinds

1163
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
as well as microsoft exchange server

1164
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,160
were published by both the eu and nato

1165
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,599
at the same day were not a coincidence

1166
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,520
um

1167
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
then

1168
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,880
in our view this is actually one of the

1169
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
successes not only of the eu but also

1170
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,079
for the larger international community

1171
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,880
because it did not only signal um that

1172
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,599
we were united but it also signaled that

1173
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,240
we are united in order to uphold the

1174
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,800
cyber norms that we agreed

1175
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,040
by the u.n framework for responsible

1176
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,640
state behavior in cyberspace

1177
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,520
and

1178
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,920
currently not only the eu and nato are

1179
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
working on how to contribute to this

1180
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
normative framework

1181
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,040
and also increasing efforts to

1182
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,119
mainstream cyber

1183
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,359
a lot of capitals are still working on

1184
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,680
how to organize their inter-agency

1185
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,280
processes for non-kinetic threats and

1186
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,520
we hope that the eu strategic compass

1187
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
and the eu's

1188
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
nato strategic concept

1189
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,200
will be putting this on the forefront of

1190
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,040
all of our agendas

1191
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,680
and hopefully assist us in avoiding any

1192
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,240
unnecessary duplication

1193
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,160
but also ensuring meaningful

1194
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,520
complementarity between the eu and nato

1195
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
and in order to foster this

1196
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,160
complementarity the netherlands also

1197
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,319
before nato published its new cyber

1198
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,119
defense policy tried to influence that

1199
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,920
process as well just as we did on the eu

1200
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,119
side

1201
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,680
and um on the opening day of this

1202
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
conference the netherlands ministry of

1203
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,319
defense

1204
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,640
released their new strategy the defense

1205
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,680
nota

1206
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,920
and the subtitle of this

1207
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,400
strategy is investing in a strong nato

1208
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,520
any new and currently the netherlands is

1209
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,599
working on a new cyber security strategy

1210
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,119
that will also be

1211
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,680
um referring and supporting our efforts

1212
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,440
in this domain

1213
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
so this all underlines the priority that

1214
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,520
the netherlands attaches to eu nato

1215
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,800
cooperation

1216
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,359
and you could actually say that i am eu

1217
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,920
nato corporation in the flesh given that

1218
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,400
i am the dutch cyber diplomat

1219
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
both at our permanent representation to

1220
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,839
the eu as well as our representation to

1221
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:18,960
nato

1222
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,200
excellent well thanks very much

1223
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,040
it's good to see

1224
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,680
a concrete example of eu nato

1225
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,319
cooperation here on the panel well with

1226
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,000
this i'd open up

1227
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,839
the floor for questions from the

1228
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,839
audience there is

1229
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,720
quite a few of you and through previous

1230
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
channels i've seen that this audience is

1231
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,800
curious

1232
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,880
asking difficult questions

1233
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,280
wanting to know and and really push push

1234
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,920
people on the panel uh feel free to do

1235
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,680
this

1236
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,640
please raise a hand if if you'd like to

1237
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,200
ask a question

1238
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,040
yes i see one here in the front

1239
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,200
thanks josh gold with the government of

1240
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,319
canada

1241
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,160
so my question is about information

1242
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,240
sharing but specifically intelligence

1243
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,520
sharing um general nakasone told us that

1244
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,920
democracies have allies and autocracies

1245
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,880
have clients and so to work as allies we

1246
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,720
need as the panel said

1247
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,280
capability development joint operations

1248
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,359
enabling others like in ukraine as mr

1249
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
lee flender spoke about

1250
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,520
and that seems to me like you'd need a

1251
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,040
lot of intelligence sharing and indeed

1252
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,560
all these conferences always talk about

1253
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,839
intel sharing or info sharing so

1254
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,359
it's long talked about but what are the

1255
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,319
main specific impediments to

1256
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,400
better information sharing specifically

1257
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,000
specifically with intelligence and i

1258
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
don't mean just like we need to build

1259
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,079
trust or confidence but maybe some of

1260
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,800
the panelists could point to specific

1261
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,760
examples of the challenges or specific

1262
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
cases of where intelligence sharing was

1263
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,079
improved

1264
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,319
and then just to close with is there a

1265
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,000
clear end goal for intelligence sharing

1266
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,680
of where that should end up or is it a

1267
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
continuous process of trying to get

1268
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,440
better and better thanks okay thank you

1269
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,640
christian do you want to take the first

1270
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,760
yes um the view on that thanks josh

1271
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,960
all those easy questions

1272
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,079
um

1273
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,839
so my experience with intel has been

1274
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,960
that

1275
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,920
there's there's no sort of a one sort of

1276
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,599
solution that that would sort of cover

1277
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,119
everything i think there are a couple of

1278
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,960
issues that go into it unfortunately i

1279
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,800
have to say that uh sometimes it's about

1280
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,359
shame um sort of people do not want to

1281
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,200
share that they've been targeted or

1282
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,960
successfully targeted

1283
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,119
because it potentially carries a stigma

1284
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
with it um which quite often prevents

1285
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,040
the rest of us from learning and

1286
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,880
improving um

1287
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,559
so i think there's still a bit of a like

1288
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,800
i said a stigma issue to it of being

1289
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
sort of attacked or being successfully

1290
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,520
targeted

1291
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,079
um i think we should get over it um

1292
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,720
i think it's almost like i said

1293
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,640
it has become normal

1294
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,920
that we're all suffering from these

1295
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,200
attacks

1296
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,960
i see sometimes also sort of the issues

1297
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,599
of politics to go with it but also sort

1298
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,960
of more than that

1299
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,079
um

1300
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,839
i mean at one point and you know that

1301
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,440
right i mean we created this miss that i

1302
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,640
also alluded to in the context of

1303
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,920
ukraine it was kind of like the kevin

1304
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,520
costner with the field of dreams build

1305
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,680
it then they will come

1306
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,079
and and they did come but um an

1307
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,000
interesting thing started to happen in

1308
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,520
other words people were not sharing

1309
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,359
everything with everybody

1310
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,040
they shared things with those that they

1311
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,800
trusted them that they had relationships

1312
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,520
with

1313
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,200
so in many ways when i look at nato's

1314
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,760
role i guess what we have done and will

1315
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
continue to do is to provide that

1316
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,000
ecosystem but then the rest of it is for

1317
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,920
the players right i mean

1318
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,319
to to fulfill that sort of ecosystem but

1319
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,440
with data

1320
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,119
and here i mean there are some very

1321
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,880
simple rules there's i mean there's

1322
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,800
trust i need to know originator control

1323
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,160
i need to know what you're doing with my

1324
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,800
data second reciprocity i mean this is

1325
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
not for just for you know for the

1326
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,319
purposes of sharing i want something in

1327
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,680
return

1328
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,960
um so some very simple rules apply um

1329
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,720
and then there's of course industry and

1330
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
i think um industry is an interesting

1331
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,640
case in a sense that

1332
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
um

1333
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,200
what my observations have been that well

1334
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
if there's no liability or a commercial

1335
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,880
issue involved it's okay to share

1336
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,319
because

1337
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,920
that actually sort of benefits all i

1338
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,240
mean rising time it lifts all the boats

1339
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,160
but not all industry partners if i may

1340
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,559
say so are also created equal

1341
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,440
so some the primes if i may say so

1342
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,839
perhaps i'm more capable and can play

1343
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,760
that role and making that link by the

1344
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,359
way going back to what alicia was saying

1345
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,839
also to the to the norms and to the kind

1346
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,319
of sort of open ecosystem open internet

1347
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,079
that we want to preserve it's not the

1348
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,200
sort of the state driven state

1349
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
state-controlled model proposed by

1350
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,720
russia and china

1351
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,880
but you know free open multi-stakeholder

1352
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,720
domain so i think in many ways i'm

1353
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,000
hopeful when it comes to industry as

1354
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,760
well because we're in it together to be

1355
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,880
very honest

1356
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,319
it's just the modalities that i think

1357
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,200
that we need to pay attention to um

1358
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,000
so

1359
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,160
i think ad hoc solutions sometimes put

1360
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,880
in place and sporadic success

1361
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,559
um

1362
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,480
but but quite often it's it's not

1363
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,599
necessarily

1364
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,359
not the technological kinds of issues

1365
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,800
that play a role

1366
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,119
but much more sort of um

1367
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,960
sometimes a transactional nature of that

1368
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,359
business as well of what is it that i'm

1369
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,960
going to get out of it

1370
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,119
and and not really doing it for the for

1371
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,359
the world peace but

1372
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,839
for a very clear policy objective as

1373
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,720
well

1374
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,880
um that's i guess sort of my experience

1375
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,480
over the last 10 years

1376
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,559
well thank you that's very good and you

1377
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,960
yourself christian

1378
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,319
in your response uh included this uh

1379
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,559
incentive about how

1380
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,440
the interaction with the private sector

1381
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,400
is is is rolling out in the context of

1382
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,040
the war of ukraine indeed i think a

1383
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,119
number of private enterprises have made

1384
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,559
a very clear value choice in this war uh

1385
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,920
in ukraine could i push you a little

1386
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,079
even ahead in in this context of

1387
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,720
information sharing um i've heard

1388
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,359
repeatedly various nato officials

1389
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,200
say that this is definitely one of the

1390
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,960
lessons learned regarding nato's

1391
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,200
cooperation with the private sector

1392
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,200
um but what exactly is there how

1393
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,559
would you see

1394
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,240
nato could institutionalize this lesson

1395
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,319
or this good spirit momentum that we

1396
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,119
currently have that nato has regarding

1397
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,280
information sharing with with the with

1398
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,319
the private sector actors uh what longer

1399
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,640
term implications are there for this

1400
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,400
tornado

1401
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,839
thank you for being pushed to push the

1402
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,960
rest of them as well myself

1403
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,400
i haven't had my morning workout so it's

1404
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,040
all good to sort of take it on um i

1405
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,599
think um well industries role i think

1406
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,079
has been crucial uh in many ways and and

1407
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,160
lots of companies that have played role

1408
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
quite often free of charge

1409
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,480
indeed um because of the sort of the the

1410
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,920
i think also very much the values

1411
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
proposition part uh that is involved in

1412
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,119
this conflict

1413
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,440
um but um sort of

1414
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,640
when i look at the existing best

1415
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,480
practice out there in the nation's uk

1416
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,680
for example the industry uh 100 whereby

1417
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,359
i think we can develop collaborative

1418
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,000
models that do not necessarily sort of

1419
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,760
have to be entailed you know based

1420
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,599
entirely and only on commercial

1421
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,000
interests i think it is possible to sort

1422
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,160
of take a look at uh how to create this

1423
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,920
win-win uh sort of situations and

1424
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,000
incentives for both side

1425
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,040
um

1426
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,079
and i think there are two core

1427
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,400
competencies right i mean the

1428
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
government gets the mandate i mean it

1429
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,960
has the social compact it its main task

1430
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,280
is to ensure security of the nation

1431
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,040
uh and at the same time industry

1432
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,000
develops the the technology uh it is the

1433
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,480
sort of the the biggest player in this

1434
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
regard um i don't see that as mutually

1435
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,319
exclusive vice versa i see it as

1436
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,319
complimentary um i think the the

1437
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,359
question

1438
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,520
just remains of yeah some have used the

1439
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,119
word institutionalize i think the sort

1440
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,480
of the trick here is how to see how to

1441
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,800
remain practical and pragmatic in these

1442
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,920
interactions

1443
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,760
uh not all industry partners will be

1444
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
created equal but i do believe they're

1445
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,720
sort of the the build it and they will

1446
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,880
come sort of principle in this regard

1447
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,680
thank you would any of you

1448
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,319
be interested in yes please yeah maybe

1449
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,839
i'll

1450
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,599
share my views and i i really you know

1451
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,400
share y'all your question that

1452
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,160
you know every every time we speak about

1453
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,720
cyber security this kind of mantra that

1454
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,640
we speak about uh information

1455
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,200
information sharing and with everything

1456
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,119
and the main argument is

1457
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,720
you know we need to

1458
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,839
build build the trust

1459
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,760
first and this is partly true but i

1460
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,640
think what uh what the current situation

1461
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,720
with ukraine shows

1462
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,160
but

1463
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,240
sometimes even more important than

1464
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,160
than the trust is

1465
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,558
a mutual interest and the mutual uh

1466
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,480
mutual threat and uh

1467
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,119
you know very imminent imminent threat

1468
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,760
and i think uh that that is a driving

1469
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,640
force

1470
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,200
behind what is happening now in terms of

1471
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,359
information sharing and and again i

1472
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,680
would say my view that

1473
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,160
in the context of of of what is

1474
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,440
happening in ukraine we have

1475
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,839
unprecedented level of information

1476
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,520
sharing between partners

1477
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,319
and it's not because we have built and

1478
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,359
yes we have built uh uh through years uh

1479
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,960
a trust but the the main incentive is uh

1480
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,000
is a mutual interest and a mutual uh

1481
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,480
imminent imminent threat

1482
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,559
and i would you know you asked about

1483
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,559
whether some some good examples i could

1484
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,040
i could also give example our national

1485
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,599
example and we would would mention

1486
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,440
another flagship

1487
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,960
defender that flagship approaches

1488
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,880
regional cyber defense center

1489
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,240
four member states um

1490
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,520
signatories of that lithuania us uh

1491
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,359
ukraine and georgia

1492
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
and naturally the focus of of that

1493
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,599
center and of of cyber threat analysis

1494
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,559
uh cell there is ukraine

1495
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,760
but we see a big interest from uh

1496
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,160
other neighboring countries latvia

1497
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,559
poland very actively participating and

1498
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,240
sharing the the information we see much

1499
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,760
more agencies from those countries

1500
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,640
taking united states you know it's not

1501
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,960
only defense agencies but other agencies

1502
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,559
responsible of critical infrastructure

1503
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,680
interested in sharing and and so on

1504
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,319
again private private sector is is is

1505
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,359
interested

1506
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,359
to come in and and

1507
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,240
put information they have and see you

1508
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,839
know how you can

1509
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,680
come up with a

1510
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,000
joint joint analysis and the joint

1511
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,720
fusion of that information

1512
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,599
so

1513
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,000
there are good very good examples not

1514
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,359
not only this

1515
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,079
there are good examples on like-minded

1516
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,720
group of of of countries more ad hoc

1517
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,480
information sharing

1518
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,839
but i would

1519
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,079
but i would say that the key in in this

1520
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,960
context is is mutual interest and a

1521
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,000
threat

1522
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
thank you

1523
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,599
sir

1524
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,920
i i gladly take the easiest part of

1525
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,760
josh's question which was the last one

1526
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,520
is this like is there like an end state

1527
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,359
or is it a process i think obviously

1528
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,200
it's a continuous process that will have

1529
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,760
to be incremental in in the years ahead

1530
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,799
um i think perhaps to complement it's i

1531
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,760
think it's

1532
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,880
obviously it's about trust um obviously

1533
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,040
it's in part about stigma as mentioned

1534
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,680
but i think it's also part about um not

1535
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,880
wanting to

1536
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,319
share publicly

1537
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
uh the capacities that some

1538
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
of our member states may have to

1539
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,400
actually detect cyber uh threats and

1540
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,079
cyber attacks so i think that's also a

1541
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,240
very important uh part of it and i think

1542
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,480
projects such as just mentioned by

1543
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,319
margiers where several member states

1544
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,319
come together in smaller circles may

1545
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,720
actually help to build that trust and

1546
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,319
that cooperation

1547
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,319
at the eu level of course we do not have

1548
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,799
proper intelligence capacities or

1549
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,480
capabilities but we can offer the

1550
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,079
framework for member states who are

1551
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,040
willing and able to do so to share this

1552
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,839
in a safe space

1553
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,920
thank you

1554
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,680
i saw another hand in the audience

1555
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,119
please

1556
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,200
and then in the back then yes matthias

1557
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,480
campbell

1558
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,599
from german cyber reserve

1559
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,680
asking a question from

1560
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,480
a lecturer point of view in many aspects

1561
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,000
i do that

1562
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,040
i realized that we currently you explain

1563
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,240
a lot about the concepts

1564
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,559
are we all confident

1565
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,160
that the idea of the concepts

1566
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,200
will reach the people who will in five

1567
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,000
years have to take over

1568
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,200
do you think

1569
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,079
what we currently explain here in that

1570
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,960
audience could reach those people who

1571
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,839
would really have to be active

1572
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,559
in translating these

1573
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,599
concepts into action and i'd say in five

1574
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,079
years because these are the ones that's

1575
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,280
a horizon for training people they are

1576
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,839
not probably not the ones who are in

1577
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,240
today but they have to take over the

1578
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,280
people of 80 18 20 25

1579
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,160
thank you that wolfgang you're not it do

1580
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,960
you have an idea yes uh that that's an

1581
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,000
excellent question and uh i i just

1582
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,760
reached back to the history again uh in

1583
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,040
my team

1584
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,720
so uh

1585
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,960
i i was the first program manager cyber

1586
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,839
defense in eda it's now the third uh

1587
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,440
we have and this is part of

1588
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,799
this handover and education and training

1589
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,880
is a a crucial element uh which i always

1590
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,760
stress in many of my presentations cyber

1591
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,400
defense is not only the technology and

1592
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,480
as stressed uh also yesterday in the

1593
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,119
ukraine uh uh

1594
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,000
panel uh it's people processes and

1595
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,119
technology this this balance and we

1596
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,160
clearly

1597
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,880
first of all have to recruit the people

1598
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,359
we are clearly as the military competing

1599
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,599
here with the private sector with the

1600
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,480
other other governmental sectors so uh

1601
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,960
this is one of the important things and

1602
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,200
those people we have we have to bring

1603
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,359
them up to speed and this is for example

1604
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,079
also one of the topics where

1605
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,640
at this stage cooperation with nato is

1606
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,000
uh i think one of the best topics here

1607
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,559
uh and uh one of the new pasco projects

1608
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,720
the cyber academia and innovation hub

1609
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,760
this is a project coordinated by

1610
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,200
portugal

1611
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,599
by accident by portugal which is also

1612
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,319
the host nation for the nato cyber

1613
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,520
academy and this is i think where we are

1614
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,480
able to mutually exchange

1615
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,319
benefit from each

1616
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,880
new course training course development

1617
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,319
new concept development uh in this

1618
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,200
so

1619
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,160
there i see the potential but the

1620
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,559
strongest point here is first we have to

1621
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,280
get the right people and we we are

1622
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,319
clearly in the cyber defense area in the

1623
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,040
armed forces compared to the manpower

1624
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,079
requirements we have still undermanned

1625
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,920
thanks thanks christian you wanted to

1626
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,760
come too yeah perhaps to start with a

1627
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,920
funny story i just recently had a an

1628
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,680
opportunity to meet with young social

1629
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,079
media influencers globally

1630
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,359
um yeah i quickly gathered them in nato

1631
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,440
yes well i quickly realized that i was a

1632
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,440
dinosaur because you know the moment

1633
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,200
i started talking about the sort of

1634
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,960
norms for responsible state behavior and

1635
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,040
international law i lost my audience

1636
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,680
anyways this was all about sort of um

1637
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,760
young people are different if i may say

1638
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,000
so

1639
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,680
here to elaborate

1640
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,280
well in a good way they're not like me

1641
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,000
so

1642
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,240
but but but in a way

1643
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,839
but it's not that they're not interested

1644
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,520
i think it's just that their view on it

1645
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,359
is a bit uh sort of different right i

1646
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,799
mean they've grown up with all the

1647
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,319
digital devices and your question was

1648
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,000
about you know what to do with with

1649
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,240
folks here in their 80s and 20s and and

1650
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,640
so forth so i think a big part of it is

1651
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,040
indeed to sort of us doing our piece and

1652
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,880
and i think we have to do our piece when

1653
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,400
it comes to sort of the institutions and

1654
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,040
the organizations as a matter of fact

1655
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,559
when i think of this sort of strategic

1656
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,319
competition that's my theoretical

1657
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,240
framework that i'm using in order to

1658
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,160
understand what needs to be done

1659
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,760
i think information sharing actually

1660
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,280
going back to josh's point is is a big

1661
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,440
one right if if you want to compete you

1662
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
have to understand what's happening

1663
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,799
what's hitting you i mean not only what

1664
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,480
you have what's hitting you and and how

1665
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,319
can you well signal that bad things are

1666
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,319
happening and you're not okay with it so

1667
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,319
information sharing i think i mean for

1668
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,160
all icare nato being nato becoming part

1669
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,559
of the c6 network mark that time

1670
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,160
there are sort of opportunities as well

1671
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,680
as the sort of capacity building and

1672
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,039
education and training

1673
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,720
but there's more i think when it comes

1674
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,799
to young folks because the sort of the

1675
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,200
we over time we will move into this sort

1676
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,640
of metaverse

1677
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,039
and we will have the digital avatars and

1678
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,680
sort of how to behave uh in that space i

1679
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,039
think that's going to be a bit of a

1680
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,880
challenge i'm not so sure that it's the

1681
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,520
institutions that is the answer

1682
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,119
i think i would go really beyond that

1683
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,039
and not only the sort of specialized

1684
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,799
educational facilities

1685
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,359
uh but really sort of educating our our

1686
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,280
citizens our people of how to how to

1687
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,440
defend themselves in that cyber space

1688
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,200
well the best that i could come up with

1689
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,440
for the social media was the influencers

1690
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,200
was basically don't click on suspicious

1691
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,880
links change your passwords often and

1692
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,760
just implement two-factor authentication

1693
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,480
and they were happy

1694
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:48,759
good good for that um yes please

1695
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,039
we should have a mike yeah

1696
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,599
thank you

1697
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,000
hi amy from ccdc

1698
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
it has been fascinating to hear about

1699
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,160
all the initiatives and strategic

1700
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,280
developments at nato eu eda and i was

1701
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,400
wondering

1702
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,799
how far these extend to

1703
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,319
partners so

1704
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,680
states who aren't members but are

1705
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,079
nonetheless very willing to engage are

1706
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,920
there limitations to how far they could

1707
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,240
be information shared corporation and if

1708
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,119
so

1709
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,960
what's being done to kind of

1710
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,880
bring out some some more especially

1711
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,720
around the globe outside europe

1712
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,799
okay yeah so partners

1713
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,799
who feels

1714
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:33,839
well

1715
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,760
i think that that was the question more

1716
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,319
for for the eu and nato how they how

1717
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,640
they see but i can i can give members

1718
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,240
his perspective and again going back to

1719
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,720
to what is happening now and uh ukraine

1720
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,359
and how important it is uh also for us

1721
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,000
to to to to see what is happening in

1722
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,240
ukraine inter so again going back to

1723
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,960
information sharing i think that is one

1724
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,480
of uh uh

1725
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,119
really really issues to to look uh in in

1726
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,799
the future beyond

1727
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,799
that we definitely through our

1728
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,480
partnerships uh

1729
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,039
long long term have uh

1730
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,920
you know very very clear programs on on

1731
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,960
capacity development for our partners

1732
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,000
ukraine starting with ukraine and so on

1733
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,240
but information sharing and how we can

1734
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,160
bring them

1735
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,799
more structurally into into those those

1736
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,720
networks we have because we are

1737
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,319
benefiting uh it's it's not only that

1738
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,799
they need that but we also need to to

1739
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,440
see what is happening uh beyond the eu

1740
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,760
and nato and very often it is uh it is

1741
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,559
linked and uh

1742
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,200
we are talking about those spillover uh

1743
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,680
effects and and and so on so

1744
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,280
i would um emphasize that beyond to the

1745
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,799
the traditional

1746
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,039
capacity building um

1747
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,799
and and and so on

1748
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,920
uh we should we should think of of how

1749
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,680
to

1750
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,880
associate them to to some of the

1751
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,400
networks um

1752
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,799
we have

1753
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,440
okay okay let's say you wanted to i want

1754
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,200
to compliment thank you for the question

1755
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,960
um

1756
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,760
for pesco projects there is an uh

1757
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,359
possibility for

1758
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,319
non-eu nations to be a member for

1759
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,039
instance the u.s and uh if i recall

1760
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,280
correctly canada also is one of the

1761
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,359
nations that's able to be

1762
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,839
part of a couple of the pesco project if

1763
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,000
they are willing to do so

1764
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,079
um in

1765
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,240
the case of the uk because of brexit it

1766
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
still is something that's been worked

1767
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,559
out i hope we're able to sort this out

1768
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,000
but in the meantime

1769
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,640
um as a member state and as a eu ally of

1770
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,119
course there's still a lot of

1771
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,799
contact between nations as well

1772
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,119
bilaterally that will be feeding into

1773
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,280
those organizations as well and that's

1774
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,280
also something that we've seen uh when

1775
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,520
it comes to for instance ukraine and

1776
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,720
assisting ukraine there both eu and nato

1777
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,319
have been pushed by member states and

1778
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,400
allies to coordinate and not only to

1779
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,599
coordinate

1780
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,319
with

1781
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,079
all the nations that they are

1782
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,839
representative of but also with the

1783
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,599
other partners that were very active

1784
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,640
there

1785
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,280
nations such as australia where the

1786
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,200
netherlands has been cooperating a lot

1787
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,960
with them on ukraine ever since mh17

1788
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,720
we made sure that all those partners

1789
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,720
were included in all our cooperation so

1790
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,599
i'm very certain that we will be seeing

1791
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,680
a need to increase more and more

1792
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,760
considering the fact that as many people

1793
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,000
have been saying resources are are

1794
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,359
scarce

1795
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,359
so we need to assure that we're not

1796
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,440
duplicating um

1797
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,200
unnecessary

1798
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,119
and ensure that we are benefiting

1799
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,559
learning the lessons learned from each

1800
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,319
other wherever we can

1801
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,960
and um i hope that we will be able to do

1802
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,200
so and also count on organizations such

1803
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,880
as the centers of excellence as the ccdc

1804
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,960
here as well could play a part in

1805
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,520
fostering outreach to

1806
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,039
a broad audience like the audience we

1807
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,280
have here today

1808
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,119
i definitely agree with the last thought

1809
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,680
seeing what about eu how successful is

1810
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,920
eu in that regards more generally in

1811
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,760
engaging with partners in cyber security

1812
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,119
capacity building

1813
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,799
yeah uh thank you for the question and

1814
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,200
then just to echo what my co-panelists

1815
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,720
have said of course i spoke about the

1816
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,119
strategic composite as a separate

1817
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,240
chapters

1818
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,319
on partnerships

1819
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,319
i only spoke about nato because that was

1820
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,160
the the topic of the panel but of course

1821
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,960
it touches upon on other uh countries as

1822
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,480
well um

1823
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,079
as i said the compass was adopted on the

1824
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,640
21st of march uh so

1825
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,559
less than a month after the 24th of

1826
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,720
february and

1827
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,720
in between that period of time of course

1828
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,400
we had to take a long and hard look at

1829
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,240
the strategic compass and adapt some of

1830
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,839
the language and one of the things that

1831
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,000
was significantly strengthened in the

1832
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,520
final version of the compass is

1833
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,039
precisely this

1834
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,200
uh strengthening resilience of partners

1835
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,440
including the western balkans moldova

1836
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,599
georgia ukraine in the wake of the

1837
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,599
russian aggression on ukraine so i think

1838
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,359
going forward that is something that

1839
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,039
will uh you will see a lot more

1840
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,280
attention a lot more financial means of

1841
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,119
being attached to them we already

1842
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,440
currently have cyber security or cyber

1843
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,119
dialogues with a number of countries

1844
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,839
obviously i think including with ukraine

1845
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,759
we are using tools such as the european

1846
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,920
peace facility to help strengthen cyber

1847
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,158
capabilities for instance in ukraine but

1848
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,120
also going forward in other countries

1849
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,359
we invite other countries to align of

1850
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,198
course with our attribution statements

1851
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,198
or with our sanctions regime

1852
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,799
so i think on the whole partnership

1853
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,880
basket you will see a lot more

1854
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,560
activity and a lot more attention than

1855
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,279
perhaps we we had uh anticipated before

1856
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,040
before the 24th of february thank you

1857
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,120
uh volcan did you feel like you wanted

1858
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,198
to add something or

1859
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,719
well uh

1860
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,719
from the eda we are a little bit limited

1861
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,000
in this area here i'm quite open frank

1862
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,799
that

1863
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,279
for really cooperation with partners we

1864
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,040
need a so-called administrative

1865
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,600
arrangement with this uh partner nation

1866
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,238
with the mod so we have this in place

1867
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,640
for example with ukraine but also with

1868
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,880
switzerland with norway and we are

1869
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,439
currently negotiating also an

1870
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,920
administrative arrangement with the the

1871
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,080
us

1872
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,839
with the expectation to have this in

1873
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,040
place later this year early next year

1874
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,520
uh but i want to stress another aspect i

1875
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,399
already uh mentioned by esteem there are

1876
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,520
for sure

1877
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,238
beyond the defense community certain

1878
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,600
initiatives of the eu for capacity

1879
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,359
building in partner nations and in

1880
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,439
partner regions and

1881
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,520
this is one of the things strongly also

1882
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,560
fostered by the eu commission

1883
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,880
i see one partnership project here in

1884
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,479
the room so

1885
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,439
with a cybernet which clearly uh

1886
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,440
tries to pull expertise within the eu

1887
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,480
on cyber to to use this pool of

1888
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,280
expertise to train

1889
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,560
partner nations uh uh to build up uh

1890
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,120
their own capacities no you are very

1891
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,080
right and eu cybernetic is one i in that

1892
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,920
regards from personal experience from

1893
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,080
the e-governance academy know that eu is

1894
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,080
doing a lot uh in ukraine um the

1895
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,520
e-governance academy is doing a lot

1896
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,679
together with the eu in places like

1897
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,400
western balkans in moldova

1898
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,520
with albania macedonia north macedonia

1899
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,800
and montenegro and beyond so that is

1900
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,320
true

1901
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,280
there's been yes one uh please i'll take

1902
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,880
the question from the back and then from

1903
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,719
here from the front

1904
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,880
yes john has embry riddle aeronautical

1905
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,800
university where we are training the

1906
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,600
next generation of cyber warriors

1907
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,440
but we talk about private public

1908
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,640
partnership

1909
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,520
private enterprise is subject to things

1910
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,520
like profit and the need for

1911
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,280
shareholders

1912
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,719
so how do we maintain over a longer term

1913
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,800
it's great for a little while but the

1914
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,920
interest wanes when it looks like the

1915
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,400
economy is not doing as well how do we

1916
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,400
keep the public private partnership

1917
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,440
working in the face of their different

1918
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,080
motivations

1919
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,040
um good question difficult to answer

1920
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,719
who's who wants to tackle it

1921
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,280
i i i want to tackle it partially

1922
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,360
this this uh uh approach of

1923
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,320
public-private partnership is clearly

1924
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,600
also an approach the eu is uh doing and

1925
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,920
again here i have to reference to to the

1926
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,080
commission they are doing here a very

1927
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,920
good job they have

1928
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,400
established certain initiatives and here

1929
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,480
i want to mention one the european cyber

1930
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,679
security organization as uh

1931
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,280
one of the

1932
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,080
main beers at the moment for for this

1933
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,480
public-private partnership between the

1934
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,159
eu and

1935
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,320
eu member states governments and the

1936
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,040
european industry so

1937
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,760
this is one of the things for sure

1938
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,320
on the question the ups and downs of the

1939
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,159
economy

1940
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,040
well for the cyber for the defense

1941
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,520
economy i think when when i look into

1942
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,120
the different programs which were

1943
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,199
announced by all our member states at

1944
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,520
the moment the the defense industry

1945
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
should not have major concerns at the

1946
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,120
moment

1947
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,760
about their revenues

1948
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,520
but here i think it's the important

1949
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,560
aspect that this not only goes to the

1950
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,080
classical defense industries but also

1951
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,120
that a a a certain amount or a

1952
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,440
reasonable amount of this goes into

1953
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,560
cyber security and cyber defense so this

1954
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,120
is also one of the things why we put in

1955
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,280
the defense defense investment gap

1956
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,560
analysis

1957
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,440
which was uh published earlier uh this

1958
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,800
month

1959
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,679
also cyber as one of the explicit topics

1960
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,719
thank you uh on nato site yeah actually

1961
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,080
we're gonna have two answers one i'm

1962
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,520
gonna go back to the partnership thing

1963
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,400
because

1964
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,159
well i invited to take a look at it not

1965
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,480
only as a mean in itself but a means to

1966
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,760
an end right i mean when i look at

1967
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,199
what's happening globally and i do

1968
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,560
business with like more than 60

1969
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,239
countries across the world

1970
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,400
and there's a huge demand for cyber but

1971
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,080
it's not equal everybody wants different

1972
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,000
things so consequently when you think of

1973
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,440
it it needs to be tailored and you

1974
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,120
really have to take into account what is

1975
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,719
it that we're talking about

1976
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,719
some indeed want hardware and software

1977
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,199
transfer and and want to improve

1978
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,520
some want to sort of contribute to see

1979
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,199
that as a sort of a two-way street and

1980
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,360
and so forth but what matters here i

1981
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,000
think is that and instead of once once

1982
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,280
again to connect it to a bigger

1983
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,040
strategic discussion

1984
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,719
i think there's a there are a lot of

1985
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,000
folks that are still sitting on the

1986
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,600
fence when it comes to the future of the

1987
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,280
internet the kinds of norms i mean look

1988
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,640
at the sort of conversations that take

1989
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,640
place in gte the open-ended working

1990
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,719
group etc

1991
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,880
so so when i look at it i mean the

1992
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,040
question that i have is is how can we

1993
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,920
shape

1994
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,920
that cyberspace and how can we shape it

1995
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,159
according to our values and our norms

1996
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,400
and and that's really to me is the sort

1997
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,159
of where the the technical means and the

1998
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,280
assistance and the work with the

1999
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,239
partners uh is important but it's for a

2000
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,560
certain strategic objective as well and

2001
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,400
we shouldn't really shy away from it and

2002
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,280
and stuff that we do stuff that eu does

2003
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,640
to be very honest i think capacity

2004
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,000
building is one of the areas where we

2005
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
should collaborate a lot and when it

2006
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,920
comes to industry yes i hear you on the

2007
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,840
on the profit part to be very honest

2008
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,360
from a nato perspective we're in an

2009
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,960
easier position i think because we're

2010
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,040
not regulators we're not regulating the

2011
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,719
market so there's less of a conflict of

2012
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,480
interest in this regard

2013
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,000
i think when it comes to security and

2014
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
defense issues and going back to intel

2015
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,560
sharing for example there's less of a

2016
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,800
commercial interest involved quite often

2017
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,360
but it is it is contextual and and i do

2018
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,880
agree that at the end of the day i mean

2019
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,480
whatever business model you put in place

2020
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,400
there need to be incentives

2021
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,159
for that to take place not all of that

2022
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,520
can be or would be sort of money related

2023
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,000
but unless you figure it out not only

2024
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,159
when it comes to organizations nato and

2025
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,159
eu institutions but also at the national

2026
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,600
level

2027
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,280
there are some really interesting best

2028
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,360
practices that we are picking up when we

2029
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,600
talk to the allies so i'm not as dire i

2030
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,360
think it's quite hopeful

2031
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,280
but it is contextual and you and i think

2032
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,719
first and foremost both sides really

2033
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,560
need to sort of understand like what's

2034
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,480
in it for them uh if you if you're not

2035
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,719
able to figure that one out i mean um i

2036
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,800
i think there's it's a bit of a lunacy

2037
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,120
to expect that sort of to emerge and

2038
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,040
happen uh just because you want it to

2039
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:27,920
happen

2040
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,800
thank you

2041
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,239
yeah please

2042
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,640
doctorian ccdcoe thank you i have a very

2043
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,880
practical question on uh

2044
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,640
public private partnership with nato and

2045
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,400
eu just yesterday got an email from my

2046
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,239
air force academy classmate who's now

2047
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,480
working for a hot silicon valley startup

2048
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,199
on

2049
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,640
quantum

2050
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,159
since they're not our sponsors i'm not

2051
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,760
going to tell their name but

2052
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,000
the question is

2053
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,679
our head of government affairs is

2054
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,840
currently evaluating where nato and eu

2055
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,600
could they be talking about quantum

2056
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,040
information sciences postponed

2057
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,640
cryptography quantum alternative

2058
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,960
navigation in a denied environment

2059
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,000
is there a interface like where a small

2060
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,520
startup relatively small doesn't have

2061
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,239
established government lobby in brussels

2062
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,480
where can they get engaged in eu and

2063
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,320
nato steen can you recommend an address

2064
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,559
downtown then schumann district

2065
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,120
i would say that probably the commission

2066
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,440
and the dj tefis would be the the most

2067
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,880
um

2068
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,640
well the most um

2069
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,440
natural point of entry for for that type

2070
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,760
of discussion um and then of course

2071
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,400
connected to that we have the the edf

2072
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,199
the european defense fund which actually

2073
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,360
has the financial tools to incentivize

2074
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,960
cooperation between member states

2075
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,800
consortia so it depends also a bit

2076
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,280
whether or not this company is actually

2077
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,679
based in europe or has at least a branch

2078
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,360
office in europe and whether it manages

2079
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,880
to to find other partners on the

2080
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,480
european territory

2081
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,320
and on that basis it could start a

2082
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,560
conversation with with the commission uh

2083
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,239
possibly introduce

2084
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,920
project proposals under the under the

2085
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,560
european defense fund

2086
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,320
and john nato

2087
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,090
yes um

2088
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,400
[Music]

2089
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,840
get back to us in six months

2090
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,560
[Laughter]

2091
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,320
we actually had the same question and

2092
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,760
that was a very reason why we created

2093
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,000
diana the the defense innovation sort of

2094
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,440
accelerator

2095
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,159
because i mean let's go back to this

2096
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,239
what like 70s 80s you know

2097
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,600
put the man on the moon and the rest of

2098
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,800
it right i mean it was largely

2099
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,040
government driven government funded the

2100
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,960
innovation part and lots of sort of um

2101
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,120
sort of sort of other technologies came

2102
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,880
out of it well nowadays it's i think i

2103
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,320
would say that it's the it's the other

2104
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,400
way around right so the question is how

2105
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
can the defense sector how can nato and

2106
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,800
our allies tap into that innovation

2107
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,400
um all of the sort of the startups and

2108
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,080
what have you and that's exactly sort of

2109
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,360
the question that we're trying to answer

2110
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,360
with diana

2111
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,159
give us some time but meanwhile yeah

2112
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,000
feel free to refer this person to me i

2113
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,040
guess

2114
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,840
okay thank you did i see another hand

2115
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,800
here yes please

2116
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,719
hi i'm florian neglov from the swiss

2117
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:01,760
government

2118
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,239
um i have a question regarding this

2119
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,560
on peace or the strategic competition

2120
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,000
short of war

2121
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,760
that was alluded to and some of the

2122
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,480
measures that were taken to try to

2123
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,080
respond to that some of them were

2124
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,080
mentioned joint statements

2125
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,080
um other things like cyber sanctions on

2126
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,679
the eu side

2127
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,440
um there's a question around the

2128
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,640
effectiveness of it and so like um

2129
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,719
christian liflander alluded to

2130
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,239
potentially going the persistent

2131
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,960
engagement route i would open up a bit

2132
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,560
this question a bit broader and say how

2133
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,400
do you shape competition into a space

2134
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,480
where you're likely to have an advantage

2135
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
so as an open question to the panel like

2136
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,400
what are the things that you think of

2137
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,560
the levers that you take to try to shape

2138
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,480
this competition in a space where nato

2139
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,199
or eu is deemed to win or at least have

2140
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,760
a long-lasting lasting strategic

2141
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,920
advantage

2142
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,840
good

2143
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,960
question uh

2144
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,040
i guess that's oh she seems to be

2145
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,080
indicating willingness to respond

2146
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,920
no um it's a good question and it's a

2147
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,440
question that we get asked a lot if we

2148
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,199
talk about sanctions like how effective

2149
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,600
are they and and is there a value of

2150
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,719
having sanctions at first and and still

2151
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,120
sanctions are are not a means in itself

2152
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,800
they're a tool in order to try to

2153
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,679
influence behavior um of the malicious

2154
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,679
actors but that's not just one of the

2155
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,520
elements why they are important and why

2156
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,360
they matter just like the declarations

2157
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,760
that we did they also matter to signal

2158
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,000
to the broader audience as i was saying

2159
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,280
but they also matter for our

2160
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,600
conversations with other issues other

2161
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,640
nations with third parties uh

2162
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,480
people in in the global south that we

2163
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,600
work and want to be more understanding

2164
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,239
of our norms so they are a tool for us

2165
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,080
in order to foster and strengthen that

2166
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,320
conversation in assuring that they

2167
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,880
understand what threats we are seeing

2168
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,120
and why we want to respond the way we

2169
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,280
did and hopefully

2170
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,280
enhance the capacity building of those

2171
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,360
nations by fostering

2172
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,440
those sort of conversations so they have

2173
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,719
a broader

2174
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,280
use and not only a use

2175
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,480
within the eu and nato but also in our

2176
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,120
conversations at the un and other for uh

2177
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,280
um but also in in just um um bilateral

2178
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,560
conversations um and and and so i think

2179
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,960
there's there still is a good use and a

2180
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,880
good reason for us to be considering

2181
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,679
those

2182
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,760
even though i don't think um as

2183
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,600
christian was saying cyberspace is

2184
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,840
always on so it's um you need to be

2185
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,880
carefully

2186
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,520
assuring when you want to

2187
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,880
respond

2188
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,159
but

2189
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,159
they truly have a measure and that's

2190
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:40,400
also why on the eu side recently we've

2191
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,120
have to renew our sanctions on a yearly

2192
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,520
basis but we also renew the sanction

2193
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,600
regime and we didn't renew it for one

2194
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,840
year but we've renewed it for the coming

2195
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,000
three years because we recognize that

2196
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,199
cyber

2197
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,440
is a domain where we will be facing

2198
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,239
sanctions um because we need to be able

2199
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,560
to have that tool in order to impose

2200
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,639
costs to those actors and set the

2201
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,560
boundaries there

2202
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,800
thank you margueritas is this something

2203
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,560
you'd like to

2204
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,360
reflect upon

2205
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,800
that was a very

2206
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,480
broad and open question

2207
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,000
you know

2208
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,040
on this

2209
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,080
unpeace and unstrategic implications of

2210
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,760
it of it

2211
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,520
i think a couple of elements from my

2212
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,440
side would be important to keep in mind

2213
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,880
in addition to what

2214
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,040
has been said

2215
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,480
the one

2216
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,360
is

2217
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,560
deterrence deterrence piece

2218
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,000
how we see how we see deterrence in in

2219
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
cyber in cyber world and

2220
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,080
because you know this is this is a

2221
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,880
you know cyber is always on we always

2222
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,320
have a cyber

2223
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,239
uh cyber conflicts and attacks so how

2224
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,560
can you deter adversaries or malicious

2225
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,520
actors not not to do not to do that or

2226
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,600
you know re consider

2227
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,360
and i'm

2228
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,520
focusing and and talking about state

2229
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,000
sponsors maybe more because when it

2230
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,400
comes to you know

2231
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,920
criminals of course we have another

2232
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,080
logic of of uh

2233
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,880
uh business business model and

2234
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,520
i think uh you know universal practices

2235
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,920
how we deal with criminals uh also helps

2236
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,880
you to

2237
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,360
to deal in cyberspace but

2238
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,600
on um on state sponsored level

2239
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,440
there are two

2240
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,280
two ways to do deterrence one is

2241
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,320
deterrent by by denial and the other is

2242
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,560
deterrent by punishment

2243
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,360
so in cyber i think deterrent by denial

2244
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,120
is not working you know you could you

2245
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,040
could have maybe vision in physical

2246
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,320
space not not not in in cyberspace

2247
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,760
but deterrence by punishment is

2248
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,040
probably one of uh one of the ways to

2249
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,880
see

2250
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,880
you know how we can

2251
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,760
really

2252
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,880
have some

2253
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,280
some some effects and of you know how we

2254
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,719
can deter

2255
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,679
the adversaries and uh one um

2256
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,560
interesting also uh in the context of of

2257
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,199
ukraine how how this how this works we

2258
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,440
haven't you know spoken about his

2259
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,520
phenomena of uh

2260
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,080
public

2261
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,400
you know support and public white

2262
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,199
harkers hikers activity which could

2263
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,600
could be seen as something uh

2264
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,280
uh uh

2265
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,040
you know deterrence deterrence by

2266
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,280
punishment for for the for the other

2267
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,159
side so that that is one aspect the

2268
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,480
other aspect when it comes to you know

2269
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,159
strategic competition i think we should

2270
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:46,239
not shy away from uh from a view that

2271
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,199
we are more and more moving

2272
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,360
when it comes to

2273
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,840
technology when it comes to cyber to

2274
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,719
more bipolar world

2275
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,239
and uh i know that for for some you know

2276
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,400
we don't like to to to see it only

2277
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,280
through bipolar uh perspective but

2278
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,800
in reality on the one hand we have uh uh

2279
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,880
autocracies on the other side we have uh

2280
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,480
democracies

2281
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,880
and uh we should

2282
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,560
you know very much

2283
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,560
you know acknowledge acknowledge that

2284
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,960
and and work together among

2285
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,679
democracies starting with

2286
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,239
all those issues we have uh we have

2287
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,760
discussed before

2288
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,639
to

2289
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,400
to also you know technology technology

2290
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,360
piece

2291
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,120
that we we should

2292
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,280
definitely you know

2293
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,159
try to minimize minimize our dependence

2294
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,360
on

2295
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,080
on on the other side and and be very

2296
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,120
conscious what what risk it can it can

2297
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,719
bring so

2298
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,040
you know this is my my my answer to this

2299
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,880
very broad question

2300
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,840
which could have many angles

2301
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,040
thank you

2302
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,719
do you want to tackle this on the other

2303
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,880
side well perhaps very briefly because i

2304
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,560
think a lot has been said i think in

2305
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,440
this um global battle of narratives so

2306
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,560
to speak

2307
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:06,850
um

2308
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,480
[Music]

2309
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,199
the

2310
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,120
what lish referred to our actions in

2311
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,960
terms of promoting

2312
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,960
international norms of responsible state

2313
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,600
behavior etc i think that will be remain

2314
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,760
a key component and trying to build a

2315
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,000
very large alliance behind that because

2316
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,080
i mean that's that's the third part

2317
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,400
and then the second part looking ahead i

2318
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,400
i think what margaret said is absolutely

2319
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,400
crucial and perhaps we did not dwell on

2320
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,719
that um for long enough in this panel

2321
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,800
but it's really about mastering the

2322
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,800
technologies of the future making sure

2323
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,960
that europe has owned its own territory

2324
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,679
as well it masters the technologies that

2325
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,639
will be essential uh going ahead 5g of

2326
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,639
course is is a prime example but it's

2327
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,440
not the only one and i think there from

2328
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,760
the eu side i mean you mentioned the

2329
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,320
diana the european defense agency has

2330
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,800
just created an innovation hub but of

2331
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
course the commission also has a massive

2332
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,639
amount of funding available through our

2333
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,040
horizon 2020 and a number of other

2334
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,000
programs the european defense fund pesco

2335
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,520
and what you will see is that we will

2336
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,360
further develop these incentives and

2337
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,840
make sure that uh well we reduce to the

2338
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,360
extent possible our strategic

2339
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,080
dependencies from from other countries

2340
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,920
um in in this regard and i think that

2341
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,679
will be crucial but obviously a very

2342
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,199
long-term effort

2343
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,040
thank you christian you have the last

2344
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,679
word on this yeah i did mention the uh

2345
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,000
the uh the joint publication 3-12 right

2346
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,600
now so i kind of have to come back to

2347
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,400
you on that one um excellent document i

2348
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,000
i recommend people read it because i

2349
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,199
think sometimes

2350
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,719
folks actually make more out of it than

2351
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:37,600
it is

2352
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,280
and get confused and scared and what

2353
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,400
have you

2354
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,000
but that is just

2355
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,600
for me this is just part of the puzzle

2356
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,960
right i mean i'm looking at the whole

2357
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,880
time phil spectrum there are other means

2358
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,239
going back to what was discussed here as

2359
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,199
well diplomatic um sort of

2360
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,679
signaling and etc etc and to be very

2361
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,600
honest a big part of it is also legal i

2362
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,840
mean italian manual for example uh how

2363
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,199
it contributed to our kind of

2364
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,800
understanding of how the existing part

2365
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,639
of international law applies

2366
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,719
it's i guess what it is mostly is about

2367
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,239
the mindset it's about the sort of

2368
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,480
thinking and connecting the dots and and

2369
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,440
and actively shaping that space uh

2370
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,760
that's what we're after but i think we

2371
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
if i had one sort of you know the

2372
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,000
recommendation is not to be deterred by

2373
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,159
our own fear

2374
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,920
we are part of that competition the

2375
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,000
question i think we need to answer is

2376
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,480
how do we want to compete

2377
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,280
excellent i think excellent words

2378
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,440
and excellent maybe take away from this

2379
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,719
nato eu panel let's not be deterred by

2380
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,600
our own fare let's be bold

2381
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,800
in this

2382
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,199
difficult times and

2383
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,880
