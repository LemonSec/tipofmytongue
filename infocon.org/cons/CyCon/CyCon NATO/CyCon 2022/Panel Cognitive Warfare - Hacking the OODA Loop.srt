1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,839
distinguished guests

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,319
colleagues uh good afternoon

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,240
and thank you for this opportunity to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,639
present the cognitive warfare concept uh

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,679
to you

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
um i must say it's a great honor to be

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,360
here i've been observing oh

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,960
sorry

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
i've been observing the

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
cycon from the sidelines for many years

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,519
and it's yeah it's a pleasure to be here

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
and speak from the same stage as so many

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,560
other

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
so many great speakers uh this week

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
sorry i need to

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,239
control this thing um the topic i'll

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,360
present

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,079
is less pure cyber than most of the

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
presentations this week but i hope i can

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
convince you that it's highly relevant

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
also for this community

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,280
hence the tagline hacking the ooda loop

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
that i hope

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,719
will resonate with the with this

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
audience those of you with military

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
background at least will know that the

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
ooda loop or the observe orient decide

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,159
act

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,400
loop is the conceptual model for human

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
decision making by the u.s air force

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
colonel and fighter pilot john boyd

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
at a high level what we're exploring

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
through this concept

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,400
is how our adversaries can hack or

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
disrupt our ooda loop

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
and how conversely we can hack or

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
defend and enhance it

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
so just to make sure that we're all on

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
the same page because not everyone is

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
nerding out about concepts every day

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
like i do

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,200
i thought

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
i'd provide this overview of nato

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
documents

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,119
and how

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
concepts fit into this

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,200
it's a little simplified but for the

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
purposes of this presentation i think it

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,119
does

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,880
does the job

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
on a side note i was very happy to see

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,560
that the incoming coe director

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
in his keynote the first day promoted

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,038
the nato cdne method and the handbook

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,440
that we published at act so

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
i encourage everyone that does cdne to

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,520
use that

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
and thank you so much sir for promoting

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
now many of you are familiar with the

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
high-level nato documents

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
listed at the top here

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,599
and the nato strategic concept that has

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,959
been referenced

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
several times this week and of course is

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,239
being prepared for a new version

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
at the nato summit in madrid in just a

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
couple of weeks

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
to make the confusion complete the nato

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
strategic concept is not a military

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
concept as i'm discussing today but

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
rather a very high political policy

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
level document that sits just behind

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
below the north atlantic treaty and sets

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
the course for nato

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
for the next decade

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
the nato military strategy is

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
a military committee strategy that in

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,120
turn

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
recently was

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
operationalized through two

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,440
high-level strategic concepts

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
one is

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,239
secures

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
deterrence and defense of the euro

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
euro-atlantic area or dda

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
and the other one is

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
sakti's

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,879
nato warfighting capstone concept or

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
nwcc

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
that concept describes how the nato

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
military instrument of power should be

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
developed over the next couple of

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,959
decades

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,760
and from the nwcc springs

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,519
a number of

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
lower level concepts

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
the multi-domain operations concept

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,599
layered resilience concept

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
and the concept that i'll be presenting

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
to you today the cognitive warfare

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,239
concept now concepts usually describe

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,000
new capabilities and once these

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,879
capabilities are developed

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,239
their use is described in doctrine

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,640
so the doctrine comes after concepts

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
the nwcc and dda have already resulted

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,798
in massive changes in our capstone

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
doctrine the ajp 01 which is currently

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
being ratified by nations

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
and this in turn will drive changes

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
throughout the whole doctrine hierarchy

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
including a new doctrine

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
at the key

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
keystone level the ajp 10.

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
now this diagram depicts the information

117
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,759
environment and it's taken from the new

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
stratcom doctrine

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
and just in case not everyone is

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
familiar with this contra construct

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
it's best described as a lens through

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
which we view the operational

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
environment from an information

124
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
perspective

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
the information environment is divided

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
into three dimensions

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
the physical virtual and cognitive

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,199
dimensions where

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
effects occur

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
now the cognitive dimension is of course

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
nothing new

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,160
it is arguably the most important

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
dimension

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
because this is where decisions are made

135
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
and where wars are ultimately won and

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
lost

137
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
military strategists since sun tzu had

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
highlighted the importance

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
of deception

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
will

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,919
decision making and similar cognitive

142
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
aspects of warfare

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,199
since then technological developments

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
have amplified the importance of

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
information in our security environments

146
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,120
and information is a resource

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,680
that is and will increasingly be used to

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
destabilize countries in particular

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,840
democracies that are exposed through our

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,280
openness while they're not new

151
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,600
disinformation activities

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
fake news conspiracy theories and so on

153
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,360
are used to fragment and polarize public

154
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
opinion

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,600
and directed towards our alliance and

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,039
our member states

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,199
turning our democratic values and

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,240
freedoms into vulnerabilities

159
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,639
they exploit and weaponize

160
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,680
fissures

161
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,479
and polarization in order to undermine

162
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
trust cohesion

163
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
and negatively impact the societal

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
resilience

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
thus representing a great risk to nato

166
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
what is new is the hyper connectivity of

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
our population

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
and the pervasiveness of the information

169
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
that is now being leveraged by our

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,680
adversaries

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
this growing availability of personal

172
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
data and other data expose new

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
vulnerabilities for

174
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
social and cognitive engineering

175
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
using

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,080
documented ways of changing human

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
behavior unconsciously

178
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
or subconsciously sorry

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
we've seen how this is done for

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
commercial purposes so it should be no

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
surprise that our adversaries are also

182
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
leveraging the same types of techniques

183
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,240
to their advantage

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,039
now

185
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
combined with emerging technologies

186
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
this gives autocracies like russia and

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
china

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
new tools for information control

189
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
manipulation

190
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,880
and disinformation

191
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,840
as you all know since 2008 and maybe

192
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
before russia has been developing a

193
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
strategy to undermine the cohesion of

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,520
the alliance

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
and in ukraine russia has systematically

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,599
used all its instruments of power

197
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
including of course the military but

198
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,080
also all the others like diplomacy

199
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
economic economics and information

200
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
to achieve its goals

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
now as kyrgyz said yesterday during his

202
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
panel

203
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
russia has suffered tactical and

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
operational setbacks

205
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
in the information environment

206
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
but their strategic long game remains

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
the same

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,960
and we must not allow ourselves to

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
become complacent because the russian

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,240
narratives are still finding fertile

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,120
soil

212
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
around the world including in our own

213
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
democracies

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,719
so

215
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
to counter this and to shape the

216
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,760
information environment to our advantage

217
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
nato must build its cognitive resilience

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
as an alliance and also help nations to

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
build their own resilience

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
we need to strengthen our own

221
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,959
cohesion

222
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
and have our own strategy to master the

223
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
cognitive dimension

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
in order to defend against adversarial

225
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
actions

226
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
to gain strategic advantage and to

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
generate the effects needed to safeguard

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
our deterrence and defense posture

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
to maintain advantage preserve freedom

230
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
of action and actively defend an uh

231
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
unfettered decision-making

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,160
hq psyche is therefore developing this

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
concept

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
first of all let me stress that nato is

235
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
of course a defensive alliance and we're

236
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
framing cognitive warfare as adversarial

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
malign actions that we need to defend

238
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
our society's forces and missions

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
against

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,040
this raises many questions that this

241
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,399
community

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,920
is probably

243
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
very familiar with

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
like how to guard against such attacks

245
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,760
how to detect them how to attribute them

246
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,080
and how to react

247
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
so we're seeing a lot of parallels to

248
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
the long process that the cyber

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
community has been going through over

250
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,439
the last decades

251
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
in order to defend we must we must first

252
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,000
understand the threat

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
and it's our belief that this threat is

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
evolving

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
some people ask if it's not just

256
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
stratcom or sciops

257
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
but we believe that with the emerging

258
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,440
technologies and new sciences

259
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,680
that it is more than just that

260
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,839
you may have heard

261
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
the term cyber-enabled information

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
operations or influence operations over

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
the recent years i believe it's been

264
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
discussed

265
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
in cycon before

266
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
however we think that the the threat

267
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
presented

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,440
is bigger than that

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
especially when we look at the time

270
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
perspective of 10 to 20 years

271
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,120
like the nwcc does

272
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
so we believe the medium to long-term

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
future threat to the cognitive dimension

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
is not just cyber enabled but more

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
broadly technology-enabled

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
and we believe that the confluence of

277
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,399
certain technologies and sciences

278
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
might create a paradigm shift for malign

279
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
influence

280
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
potentially multiplying the adverse

281
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
effects we're already seeing in our

282
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
societies

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,240
now looking at the next couple of slides

284
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
please keep that 10 to 20-year

285
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,839
horizon in mind because some of it might

286
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,000
seem a little bit like science fiction

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
and it's important to note that these

288
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,720
are just a couple of examples of

289
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,519
potential developments that might affect

290
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
this space

291
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,560
also

292
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
i want to stress that while

293
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
our own capabilities might use some of

294
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
these tools

295
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,160
our adversaries of course

296
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
continuously show that they

297
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
go way beyond what nato's ethical legal

298
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,519
and moral boundaries are

299
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
and to mirror the transparency

300
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,959
discussion from earlier in the

301
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,160
conference

302
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,880
how nato operates in the cognitive

303
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
dimension is clearly described in

304
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,800
publicly available doctrine

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,920
so

306
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
what kind of technologies are we talking

307
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,800
about

308
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
let's start with the most obvious

309
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,480
these are ttps that we've already

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,959
observed over several years

311
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,279
now our own stratcom structure is

312
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
already starting to leverage

313
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
some emerging technologies like ai and

314
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
data analytics in the information

315
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
environment assessment capability or iea

316
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
that's currently being developed by nato

317
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
ia will provide detailed analysis of the

318
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
information environment in order to

319
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,959
support coherent and successful

320
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,239
strategic communication

321
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
and contribute to the

322
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,639
alliance deterrence and defense

323
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,760
our adversaries are combining this with

324
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
data mining of personal data

325
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
allowing them to perform

326
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
highly targeted campaigns

327
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
or so-called micro targeting

328
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
the data provided

329
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
or provides deep insight into the

330
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
psychology of targeted groups and

331
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,720
individuals and is exploited to change

332
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,440
attitudes and behaviors

333
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
the cambridge analytics data scandal

334
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,920
from a few years back is of course

335
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,760
a highly emblematic example of this

336
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
sorry

337
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,920
there we go

338
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
a more recent addition to the flood of

339
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,120
data

340
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
comes from the emerging field of

341
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
wearables

342
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
now

343
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
probably you all or most of you have

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
smart watches but there are other types

345
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,880
of wearables as well

346
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
and increasingly

347
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
they are gathering physiological data

348
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
about us

349
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,839
and this opens the door to

350
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
targeting individuals at the exact time

351
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,920
where they're most vulnerable to

352
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
influence

353
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,839
except for for instance when you're

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,279
tired

355
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,399
hungry

356
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
angry or happy or whatever you're much

357
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,440
more vulnerable to influence

358
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
and

359
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
if an adversary can tap into this kind

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
of data

361
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
it's they're much more likely to be able

362
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,320
to achieve their intended effects

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
now if this data is properly protected

364
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
and we all know from

365
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
history that that's not always the case

366
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
it might not be easy to utilize this for

367
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
mass influence but it's certainly within

368
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
the realm of the possible

369
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
that our adversaries might use this for

370
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
high value targets

371
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
now this might look familiar to some of

372
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
us after last night

373
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
where we got a bit of a taste of virtual

374
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,518
reality

375
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
the emergence of the metaverse

376
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
as the next generation of social media

377
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
bears with it the promise

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
of a highly immersive experience

379
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
almost like living in a video game if

380
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
you will

381
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
um i don't know how long it will take

382
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
for meta and other companies to realize

383
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
this

384
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
but it is an enormous growth industry

385
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,839
and

386
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
i'm sure that meta and others are

387
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,320
working hard to make it to

388
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,399
make it a real a reality as soon as

389
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,759
possible

390
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
now seeing how traditional

391
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
two-dimensional if you will social media

392
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
has enabled

393
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,079
influence over the last decade

394
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
it's easy to imagine

395
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
how much more

396
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
uh

397
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,600
or the threat potential if you will of

398
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
immersed immersive experiences like this

399
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
when it becomes broadly available

400
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
and it's an area

401
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
that i think is of concern to many

402
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,040
and that i know

403
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,959
is being researched quite a bit

404
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,519
um

405
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
you can imagine the metaverse being

406
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
combined with deep fake technologies

407
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
and imagine

408
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
how much more compelling a message would

409
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
be if you received it during a natural

410
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,199
conversation

411
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
with a beautiful person that perfectly

412
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,519
matches your tinder preference or maybe

413
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,240
a person that you are the

414
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
the fake virtual representation of

415
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
someone that you highly respect

416
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,120
professionally

417
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
now

418
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,359
going deeper into the rabbit hole we are

419
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
getting to neuroscience

420
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
and if you're following this space you

421
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
will know that at this moment

422
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
neuroscience is actually enabling us

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
read and write access

424
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
to the brain and to cognitive functions

425
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,240
granted it's still relatively

426
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
rudimentary

427
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
but this uh

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
but the science now allows some patients

429
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
long thought brain dead to communicate

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
with their surroundings and some of you

431
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
might remember that a a man that had

432
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,559
been locked in for years woke up and

433
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,080
asked for a beer

434
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,439
so that's my kind of guy

435
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
i'm i'm sure you've also seen examples

436
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,080
of brain controlled video games and the

437
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,360
like

438
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,559
now there are currently three major

439
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,200
brain science initiatives

440
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
run by china

441
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
the eu and the us respectively these are

442
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
driving research providing an

443
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
exponential growth in our knowledge

444
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,240
about the brain and cognitive functions

445
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
so what this

446
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
does for us is that because we are

447
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,000
starting to be able to read

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
thoughts

449
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
to a degree and emotions

450
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
it gives us the ability to measure

451
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
cognitive effects

452
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
it also gives us the ability once we

453
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
have gathered data and knowledge to

454
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,919
start to model cognition and start to

455
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
model the cognitive dimension

456
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,840
then we're getting closer to

457
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
using modeling and simulation much in

458
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,480
the same way we are using for other

459
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,160
disciplines in in the military enabling

460
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
experimentation wargaming and so on

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,960
and this will be of paramount importance

462
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
to boost our understanding of the

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,360
dimension

464
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,400
so there are also several research

465
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
efforts

466
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
that look into the possibility of

467
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
cognitive enhancement

468
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
and as part of the concept effort we're

469
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,640
sponsoring a study by the nato industry

470
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
advisory group or niag

471
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,039
that will present possible military

472
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,240
applications for cognitive enhancements

473
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
to protect and improve our decision

474
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,360
making as well as other applications

475
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,240
like

476
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
ptsd and traumatic brain injury recovery

477
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,600
now

478
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
the nato science and technology

479
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
organization or sto

480
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,440
also has several efforts

481
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
to identify

482
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
needed research to advance our

483
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
understanding of cognition and to

484
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
advance the development of

485
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
defense against cognitive warfare

486
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,640
sorry

487
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,840
with neuroscience as with other

488
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
developments what will distinguish us

489
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
from our adversaries in this field is

490
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
whether the science is applied in

491
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
accordance with ethical legal and moral

492
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
standards

493
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,039
and in nato we are 30 democratic nations

494
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
hopefully soon 32 that has to agree on

495
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
these standards

496
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
not so for china or other autocracies of

497
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
course

498
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,360
where open sources tell us that they are

499
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,640
conceptualizing the weaponization of

500
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
neuroscience

501
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
for military purposes to target

502
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
the brains of their opponents

503
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
and

504
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,039
that brings us to

505
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,320
the end or science fiction-esque tour

506
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,840
with

507
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,000
havana syndrome i don't know if you're

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
aware of that certainly those of you

509
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
from the us know because it's in the

510
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
news all the time

511
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
but what we're seeing is a quite large

512
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
number of cases approximately 130 at

513
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
this point in u.s embassies around the

514
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
world

515
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
where people are experiencing

516
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,520
debilitating headaches and other

517
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
symptoms affecting the brain causing

518
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
sick leave retirements and reduced work

519
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
performance

520
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
now this has not been attributed to any

521
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,960
state actor but it's suspected

522
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,400
that it is caused by adversary states

523
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,679
using directed energy weapons

524
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
with either microwaves or

525
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,919
non-audible

526
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
sound waves

527
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
now this is

528
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,320
if if it has a capability uh it's

529
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
causing both physical effects

530
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
that causes

531
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
or if it

532
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
affects cognition

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
but it's also spreading fear and

534
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
uncertainty in the u.s intelligence and

535
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
diplomatic community

536
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
which is of course a cognitive effect in

537
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
and of itself

538
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
and if it's caused by intentional acts

539
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
they are likely to be further developed

540
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
and potentially used also on the

541
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,918
battlefield

542
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,480
so having taken a brief look at some

543
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
potential future threats and

544
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
opportunities

545
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
in the information environment

546
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,400
let's bring it back to the concept

547
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
and the problem space that we're

548
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,320
exploring

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
we need to increase our understanding of

550
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
the information environment generally

551
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,480
and the cognitive dimension specifically

552
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,039
the iea capability i mentioned earlier

553
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,600
will take us in the right direction

554
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,480
through analysis of the media space of

555
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,200
sentiment analysis and so on but it will

556
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
also increase our knowledge of

557
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
psychological

558
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
anthropological sociological factors to

559
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
name a few

560
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,919
the evolution of neuroscience that i was

561
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,480
talking about also gives us hope that we

562
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,559
will soon be able to start developing

563
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,760
models

564
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,480
to

565
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,520
increase

566
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
the value of

567
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
training and exercises

568
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
and

569
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,559
experimentation

570
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,760
so

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
secondly we have a strong bias

572
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,559
towards effects on target audiences in

573
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,799
our doctrine and practice

574
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,120
and we need to start defending our

575
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
society's forces and missions against

576
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,480
malign influence in a much more

577
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
concerted way

578
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we need to build cognitive resilience

579
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
through education and training on

580
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
topics like critical thinking and media

581
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,960
literacy of course and other relevant

582
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,919
topics that especially some nations in

583
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
the alliance

584
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,520
are

585
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
have more knowledge about than others

586
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
because you have been exposed to this

587
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,760
type of activity for a long time

588
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,080
now we need to create a coherent

589
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
approach to cognitive defense

590
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
and we believe that there are many

591
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
parallels to the challenges the cyber

592
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
community have been facing for years as

593
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
i mentioned we need to sort out how to

594
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
detect attribute and react to these

595
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,039
kinds of attacks

596
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
i will need to figure out how to share

597
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
threat information

598
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,360
and we of course also need supporting

599
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,879
legal and policy frameworks

600
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
thirdly even though the importance of

601
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,120
the cognitive dimension uh has been

602
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,600
recognized over millennia

603
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,799
it's a really hard sell

604
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
one it's complicated

605
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
two it's intangible and three

606
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
there is no big fancy hardware or

607
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,200
anything that goes boom which of course

608
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,360
makes it hard to to

609
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,159
sink money into this

610
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
fourthly the hybrid nature of these

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
threats is causing the usual and of

612
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,279
course intended headaches

613
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,679
with unclear roles responsibilities and

614
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,880
authorities

615
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
between different parts of government

616
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,080
and instruments of power

617
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,159
keeping actions below the threshold of

618
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,840
armed conflict is posing

619
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,520
strategic dilemmas to our democracies

620
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
that don't want to sort of

621
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,000
cross establish boundaries

622
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,039
finally ethical and legal and moral

623
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
aspects

624
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,559
there are several

625
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,520
uh

626
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,919
questions that needs to be asked

627
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
uh

628
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,159
in this space and we have uh we have a

629
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,679
supporting study led by our legal office

630
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,120
and the

631
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
shapes legal office

632
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
i will

633
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
investigate

634
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
several dimensions of this one is that

635
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
many of the limitations we're facing

636
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
is imposed by policy rather than law so

637
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,559
there is

638
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,159
a potential

639
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,200
for

640
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,360
movement there

641
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,559
other things that needs to be

642
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
established is

643
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,440
thresholds

644
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,520
where do we put them

645
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,400
in terms of reacting

646
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,559
another issue of course is that we fight

647
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
by different rules than the adversary

648
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
because we're not willing to compromise

649
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,520
on our values

650
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
okay

651
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
finally

652
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
the cognitive warfare concept will

653
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
propose how nato can effectively

654
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,279
increase the cognitive resilience of our

655
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,360
military instrument of power

656
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,080
but could also be applied to our society

657
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
societal resilience

658
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,480
the concept will provide a framework for

659
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
nato to develop the military

660
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,919
instrumental power

661
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
by appreciating the implications of the

662
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,840
cognitive dimension for the

663
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,640
alliance

664
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,840
warfare development and its adaptation

665
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
through defense planning capabilities

666
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,600
and doctrine

667
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,120
the goal is to recognize respond

668
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,720
and repel cognitive threats under

669
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,960
appropriate ethical and legal frameworks

670
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,279
that is agreed by all nato nations

671
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,159
the cognitive warfare effort will

672
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
position nato to cease the initiative in

673
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
the cognitive dimension

674
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
and ensure the alliance is prepared to

675
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,159
defend against any cognitive attack from

676
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
aggressors

677
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,720
thus we will ensure nato maintains its

678
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,840
warfighting advantage and

679
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,279
safeguard its freedom of action to

680
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,760
protect our way of life

681
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,399
and offer security from assertive

682
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,200
authoritarian actors and extremist

683
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,840
ideologies

684
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,960
so i will conclude by saying

685
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
that

686
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
while empowering ourselves

687
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
in the information environment and the

688
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
cognitive dimension

689
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,279
nato must never surrender our principles

690
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
and values

691
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
when russia

692
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
seeks to disrupt and confuse the

693
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
narrative and china seeks to control it

694
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
nato must speak the truth

695
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,159
as we have been doing during the russian
