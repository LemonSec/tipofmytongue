academy

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
and what we're going to be doing here is

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
really an informal

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,719
free-flowing conversation this will not

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
be a sort of succession of presentations

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
we want to make it uh a nice interesting

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
interactive chat

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,519
and we we we intend to sort of do that

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
for 45 minutes or so and then to open

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,040
the floor

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
to questions from from all of you guys

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
so let's start off mike uh so my first

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
question is sort of directed to you

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
and

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,680
it's basically this so we had talon 1.0

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,479
which was all about ihl and cyber we had

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
talon 2.0 which is about the rest of

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,520
international law and cyber so why

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
bother with talent 3.0 this is

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
this is a question that i continue to

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
ask myself marco uh

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,920
so the reason 3o came is because the

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
environment of cyber has changed

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
dramatically since stalin 2.0

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
when we did tallinn one which was really

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
focused on use of force odd bellum

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
issues and ihl uh we finished that in

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
the ccdcoe came forward and said hey

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
what do you guys want to do next that

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,640
was good let's do something together and

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
and then the decision was well let's

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,759
just keep going

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,200
because on a day-to-day basis

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
states aren't involved in the use of

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
force in cyberspace they're involved in

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
the sorts of things you read about in

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
the newspaper all the time and so let's

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
start looking at sovereignty and human

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,959
rights and non-intervention et cetera et

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,440
cetera et cetera and add it to the work

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
that had already been done in ihl and

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
use of force

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,160
but when we finished that project uh in

68
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,840
2017 or as we were doing the project

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
marco in 2017 2013 to 2017 states were

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,239
pretty much silent

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
on the issue of how international law

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
applies in cyberspace

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
but that's changed pretty dramatically

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
so now we have starting well a number of

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
countries before that in a smaller way

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,840
but for example the very noteworthy

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
statement by the british attorney

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
general at chatham house in 2018 and

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
then the dutch send over to from the mfa

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
to parliament their position and it's

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
pretty granular it's pretty comp it's

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,800
pretty uh

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
sophisticated

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
other states do the same and then most

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
recently with the 2021 gg now we have 15

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,200
statements by states

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
additionally we have the work that

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
joanna can talk about in the ungge

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
we have we had 2013 2050. now we have a

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
statement in 2021 and then there's the

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
work of the open-ended working group so

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,720
my view of international law is that

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,519
although academics can opine on what

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,680
they think the law is at the end of the

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
day international law is made by states

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
and only states international law is

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
authoritatively interpreted by states

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
and only states so now states are spoken

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,239
are speaking

100
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
so we thought it would be good to take

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
the manual

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
and fold in what we're getting from

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,519
states now that states have started to

104
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,280
think uh through the issue moreover

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,680
back in 2017 there was very little

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
scholarship and now there's lots of

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
scholarship we launched a book yesterday

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
on a topic that i never really had

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
thought about human rights privacy armed

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
conflict never really occurred to me to

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
think about that so we now have

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
mountains of scholarship some of it

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
terrible and some of it really really

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
really first rate

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,440
some of it first rate like that book

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
so we need to

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,479
the book is on the second half okay it

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,000
was a great book

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
uh so now we have the thoughts of

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
a lot of scholars so we thought the

121
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
we would take the opportunity to bring

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
it up to speed because we know it's used

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
by legal operators this is not some

124
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
historical book this is people are

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
actually using the book so we need to

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
ensure that that it remains current and

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,919
then finally mark as you and i have

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
talked about it marco and i are

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,360
co-general editors along with a

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
brilliant estonian attorney lee's viewel

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,440
uh and we're supported by the way by

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,039
lizzie anderson who's our project

133
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,360
manager who at the cc she's somewhere in

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
the audience i can't see her

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,479
back there

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
so um

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
uh

138
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
so we we

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
in our discussions we we kind of

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
understand that there may be some

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
subjects that we need to look into that

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
we have not looked into before

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
so mark and i had a meeting yesterday we

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,240
were talking about this things like

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
intellectual property when we travel

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
around we get lots of questions about

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
intellectual property international

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,039
criminal law

149
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
um

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
we dealt with that in a couple of rules

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
but we think it merits more treatment

152
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
environmental law marco

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
took on the project of of thinking about

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,639
environmental law in the cyber context

155
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,160
we'll probably have a chapter on

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
environmental law and then finally a

157
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,080
subject which i don't know the first

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
thing about but

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,360
is apparently very important

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
international investment law and cyber

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
so we'll be adding those new chapters

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,319
into the project so keeping it current

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
and adding material that we thought is

164
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,560
important both from the perspective of

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
what states say and new subjects thanks

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,560
for explaining to me why i'm working

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,919
with you yeah you're working with me

168
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,840
because we're fun together that's why

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
you're working

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
it's good to know but

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
so it's interesting

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
the way you put it that states and only

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,039
states

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,680
end up making international law

175
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
when that's obviously not true no i

176
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,919
think you're uh because

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
in the end it's actually projects like

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,039
these make a tremendous impact and the

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
question is how do they get to make that

180
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
impact and this is not the first or

181
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
unique such project you know in the

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
history of international law i mean you

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
all remember how historically the

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
institute of international law you know

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
was adopting all sorts of resolutions

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
and so on that had huge impact and way

187
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
before that we go back to the age of

188
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,759
groceries where you know prussian kings

189
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
carry the pocket edition of the war in

190
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
the law of war and peace and you know uh

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,120
uh

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
adjusted their behavior to it so one

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
major theme that we want to explore in

194
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
this conversation is how a project like

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,639
this is becomes either a success

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
or a failure

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
and what determines success or failure

198
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,000
so that brings me

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
to people who actually matter

200
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
and that's

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,680
sticks this is my point

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
and that states actually by that

203
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
definition i no longer matter because i

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,800
am no longer working for a state so uh

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
you know i might as well just finish

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
talking now yeah

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
but but that would not be fun

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
so so so tell us johanna you know like

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,840
you have participated in every single

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
basically negotiation that has existed

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
you know within the u.n whether it's the

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,400
geg or the open-ended working group or

213
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
whatever and

214
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
you could tell from the inside

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
you know to what extent the talent

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
manual had an impact on these

217
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
negotiations on what states thought on

218
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
on the views that and positions that

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
states had so what is your impression of

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,080
a

221
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
whether the manual has been successful

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
under some benchmark influential or some

223
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,639
benchmark and why

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
sure so i think the first thing i would

225
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,759
say is the talent manual has absolutely

226
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
been influential

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
but i don't necessarily think it has

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
been hugely influential in the

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
negotiations and that is a reflection

230
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
not of the talent manual but of the

231
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
negotiations and that is because the

232
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,958
negotiations themselves generally don't

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,479
get into the level of depth that the

234
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
talent manual does right so

235
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,880
uh the first session of the last gge uh

236
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
we had uh 25 experts gathered around the

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,720
table uh we were in i forget if we're in

238
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
geneva or new york i think we're in

239
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
geneva

240
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
and three of the new experts came with

241
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
the talon manual on the table they

242
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
brought it with them and sat it down so

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
the green book is sitting on the table

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
and the conversations start

245
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
and

246
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
the experts have differing levels of

247
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
experience in engaging in the gge so you

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
have people like michelle markov uh the

249
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
us representative and andre krutzky the

250
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
russian representative who have been

251
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,839
doing this since 1998 right so not only

252
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
do they have a very um

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
fairly intimate relationship uh between

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
each other

255
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,160
like the krutski

256
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
krutzke for example has proposed

257
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
marriage to michelle multiple times uh

258
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
including in gge sessions

259
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
uh peace in the world yeah exactly

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
exactly so you have you know these two

261
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,040
um love them hate them uh doings of the

262
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
process

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
and then you have people like me who i

264
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,000
was an observer in the 2007 or advisor

265
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
in the 2007 process and then became an

266
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
expert in this process

267
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,360
and then you have absolute newbies and

268
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
of the newbies at the table sometimes

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,839
they're diplomats and sometimes they

270
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,000
come from cyber agencies and sometimes

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
they're lawyers so you have really quite

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,279
a diversity of people at the table

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,600
and it's it's very and a very

274
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
interesting psychological experiment to

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
watch people and the group dynamics that

276
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
happens in that kind of negotiation with

277
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
25 people essentially having a

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
conversation backwards and forwards

279
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
and the presumption at the start is that

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,519
you are going to get right down into the

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,040
depth like let's talk about the

282
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,519
technicalities of state sovereignty and

283
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,839
um you know does the

284
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
how did countermeasures apply and and

285
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,120
all of these concepts but actually very

286
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
quickly it becomes a conversation about

287
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
uh are we going to be able to progress

288
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
one or two sentences on

289
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,839
insert x principle of international law

290
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,560
and that doesn't need the talent manual

291
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
it becomes a diplomatic negotiation

292
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
exercise but the reason that i say that

293
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
it's so influential is a because the

294
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,399
experts bring it and sit it on the table

295
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
but b when we went into lockdown we

296
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,279
suddenly had an insight into people's

297
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,200
workspaces right so we were doing

298
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
negotiations

299
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
so the gge sessions were running uh six

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
hours a day um and you would sit and not

301
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
always the conversation is interesting

302
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
so you're

303
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
looking at people's backgrounds and

304
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,519
seeing what people have and it's quite

305
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
notable how many people have their

306
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
bookshelves behind them and how many

307
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
experts had the talent manual on the

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
bookshelf sitting behind them

309
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
the other way area where it's very

310
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
clearly influential is mike you

311
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,920
mentioned the um the national statements

312
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,279
on international law and i guarantee you

313
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,880
every lawyer that prepared that

314
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
statement will have consulted the talent

315
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
manual in preparing the statement now

316
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,880
states have differing views about

317
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
whether they agree with the content

318
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
but it is the go-to resource in terms of

319
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,480
formulating positions and inform

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
informing people about uh what the

321
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,399
differing positions are and i think the

322
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,120
idea of updating it to incorporate what

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
has been said about states views is uh

324
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
is

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
a great idea

326
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
and something that is very much needed

327
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
the the final thing that i would say is

328
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,600
uh

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
there's a strange hesitancy i think

330
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
sometimes to acknowledge among states

331
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
how influential the telling manual is

332
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
because they don't necessarily like to

333
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,399
acknowledge that something that comes

334
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
from outside of states is so influential

335
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
and i find that interesting uh but it's

336
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,320
certainly through my experience and and

337
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,519
the engagement that i've had with

338
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,079
lawyers uh from many many different

339
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
countries it is uh something that people

340
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,680
consult

341
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,360
particularly countries that are new to

342
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
the debate

343
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
thank you so much jana so i it this

344
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
whole idea of state ownership

345
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,880
or rejection of a project like this is a

346
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
kind of foreign entity is i think a

347
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,079
major theme

348
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
and when you look at other sort of big

349
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
codification or progressive development

350
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
efforts you know within the

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
international legal system the

352
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,720
international law commission is probably

353
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
the main vehicle for such such

354
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
development but its procedures are

355
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,079
designed precisely in such a way to get

356
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,600
state buy-in exactly yet even there

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
there's only one articles on state

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
responsibility that everybody routinely

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
cites

360
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
you know 90 percent of ilc work product

361
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
with

362
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
you know

363
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
you know did you really you know read

364
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
the transboundary

365
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
you know water whatever thingy you know

366
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
so so that's it's it's it's really it's

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,880
variable and and again the question is

368
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
how does one achieve success or failure

369
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,279
but that brings me to paul so paul your

370
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
experience is of course

371
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,680
from a different kind of state

372
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,199
standpoint right so not within the

373
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,720
negotiations but

374
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
within actually

375
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,000
operationally doing things or advising

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
the military on what can and cannot be

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
done so how would you assess the utility

378
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
of the manual

379
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,279
from that standpoint you know do

380
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
military operators find it useful do

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
they rely on it do they think it's

382
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,680
authoritative

383
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
in your experience

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
mike is arresting me already

385
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
stop keep eyeballing all right i would

386
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
i would say

387
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
the utility comes from

388
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
various strands

389
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
from a dutch perspective and you already

390
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
mentioned it the groceries

391
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
and and the dutch have a quite a long

392
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,760
tradition uh promoting international law

393
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
or writing it or even violating it by

394
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
the way i guess so uh

395
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,959
should i have made a waiver yeah okay

396
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,120
right so we we have this long tradition

397
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
uh so i guess the utility

398
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
finds its place over there as well uh

399
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
the dutch constitution i was told it's

400
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,399
the only one in the world

401
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
where the sovereign has

402
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
ordered the government to promote

403
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
international law it's it's article 90

404
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,800
in our profi in our constitution

405
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,839
and and that means that that could be a

406
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,720
very

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
legit

408
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
that could be

409
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,519
uh explanation why the dutch have

410
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,760
supported uh the writing and the

411
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
dissemination of the the italian manual

412
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
but the the more logical uh

413
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
is the more logical explanation is that

414
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
that we've always been involved in

415
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,279
international law think of groceries

416
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,399
think of the

417
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
the the international court of justice

418
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,800
that is uh based in the hague think of

419
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
the tribunals so that the utility finds

420
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,079
itself on a political strategic legal

421
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
level in in that respect

422
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,560
going down

423
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
to the

424
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
utility for the netherlands itself

425
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
i would say that there's again

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
there's various strengths one of them

427
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
being the

428
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
political strategic level

429
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
finding its utility

430
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,279
by

431
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
the reason but now by by

432
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,959
having it

433
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
applied in uh in promulgating a

434
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
integrated response framework

435
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
how to respond to a cyber incident cyber

436
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,800
attacks

437
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
whether criminal or

438
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,279
espionage or whatever

439
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
motive is behind it

440
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,000
and whilst developing that

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
framework the manual has been used

442
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
it

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
was also used uh when the netherlands

444
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
issued that statement on the uh on the

445
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
applicability of the the manual are

446
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
actually on international and cyberspace

447
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,120
they they intensively uh checked what

448
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,959
was in the manual and

449
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
uh found themselves

450
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,759
agreeing and and also uh abstaining of

451
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
of opinions

452
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
and um

453
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
so

454
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,199
by using that internet that integrated

455
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
response framework it serves as a legal

456
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
basis

457
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
so it it will

458
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
it will tell policy makers

459
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,880
it will tell

460
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
decision makers

461
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
on the strategic level

462
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,679
when

463
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,880
uh

464
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
when and how to respond

465
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,280
after cyber incidents or cyber attacks

466
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
of whatever nature

467
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
that is that is

468
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,679
when to

469
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
uh when to use international law and how

470
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
to use it from a legal basis point of

471
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
view so comparative use of balum

472
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
going down to the to the to the uh

473
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
tactical and operational uh sphere

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
uh the manual will tell you

475
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,679
uh

476
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
what the issues are when you

477
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
use operations when you launch and plan

478
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
operations and and what uh what the

479
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,919
difficulties are for the legal advisor

480
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
but also for commanders or those

481
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
planning those operations or the

482
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
responses to them

483
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,640
uh what should be taken into account in

484
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
compared with the targeting uh cycle uh

485
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,039
with a number of legal questions

486
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,600
alongside the the operational questions

487
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
so that that's

488
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
summing up there's three

489
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
reasons why it's of use uh first of all

490
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,559
it serves a constitutional tasker to the

491
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
government to

492
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
promote international law

493
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
secondly it helps

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
top government officials and decision

495
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
makers

496
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
in their decision-making process

497
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,720
if they have a need to respond to cyber

498
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
incidents or if they are

499
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
thinking of launching operations

500
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
themselves and then number three is on a

501
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
tactical level or operational level

502
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
those planning and executing operations

503
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,480
how to do that

504
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
how is that done what is collateral

505
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
damage in in a digital realm

506
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,840
right

507
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,559
so

508
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,120
mike yeah so i thought your question was

509
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,679
an important one and the question is why

510
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,320
is this relatively successful because it

511
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
isn't the first contemporary manual and

512
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,360
i've been involved in a lot of the the

513
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
manuals that have been developed like

514
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,559
for example i was one of the drafters of

515
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,720
harvard's air and missile warfare manual

516
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,039
which immediately preceded the launch of

517
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,520
the tallinn manual project and i was in

518
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
the icrc's direct participation in

519
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
hostilities

520
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
uh project and

521
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
i was one of the authors of the san remo

522
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,039
manual on non-international armed

523
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
conflict but the talon manual was

524
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
different and it was different because

525
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
all of those previous including the san

526
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
remo manual which i did not participate

527
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,720
in

528
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
uh on naval warfare naval operations all

529
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
of those only came to a single

530
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
conclusion this is the law we're trying

531
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,320
to do a restatement of law and this is

532
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
the law

533
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
when we started the uh the ptolemanual

534
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
project very first hall of manual

535
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
project way back in 2009

536
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
we understood that that was simply not

537
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
going to work it was not going to work

538
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
because

539
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
no one had written on i mean there were

540
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
a few articles out there but really no

541
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
one in written no one had been thinking

542
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,360
about it the reason we started thinking

543
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
about it was because of what happened in

544
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,520
2007 in this country and then the

545
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
exchange of cyber hostilities and the

546
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
georgia russia conflict but no one had

547
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
been thinking about it we knew it was

548
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,400
new

549
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,280
moreover we didn't really understand the

550
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
technology to be frank and so we were

551
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,440
uncomfortable applying the law to the

552
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,600
technology that we didn't quite get i

553
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
mean i i see a naval officer in the

554
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
audience i'm a graduate of the naval war

555
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
college uh and when people started in

556
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
the very beginning people started

557
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
talking about summering cables i thought

558
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
submarine cables were something your sub

559
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
comes up and they plug a cable in and

560
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,840
now you have communications

561
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,280
you know so and i mean that that was the

562
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
level of understanding in the

563
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,600
international law community because

564
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,880
people like me and paul we were thinking

565
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
about counterterrorism we were thinking

566
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
about black sites interrogation

567
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
kinetic operations during an armed

568
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
conflict so we made the decision early

569
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,039
on and it was the decision that i think

570
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,919
led

571
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,919
in great part to the success

572
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,720
that we would not purport to necessarily

573
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
know the answer but rather we would

574
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,640
commit to

575
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
reflecting in the manual every

576
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
reasonable view

577
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
now you know the manual as as as good as

578
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
anyone else we did

579
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
decide that

580
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,760
we would take

581
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
and paul was one of our our experts we

582
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
we did decide that we would reflect

583
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
majority views among the international

584
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
group of experts minority views and

585
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,919
whenever you see few that means one or

586
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,559
two or three and if a state had

587
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
expressed the view but none of us shared

588
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,000
that view

589
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
for example one state has a view that

590
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
sovereignty may be breached by non-state

591
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
actors nevertheless we would reflect

592
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,039
that view as we acknowledge the

593
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,520
existence of a view

594
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,159
and so when it came out to states when

595
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
they started

596
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
using this manual

597
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
in most cases they could find a view

598
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
that was explained here's the rationale

599
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
for the view

600
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
that was consistent with their own

601
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,880
national interest and so it was very

602
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,760
much less a threat and has someone who's

603
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
been involved in the project from the

604
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
beginning whenever i hear someone say i

605
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
don't agree with the talent manual it's

606
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,600
like dude what agree with what i mean

607
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
which rule are you talking about because

608
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
the rules require unanimity consensus

609
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,120
and they're very broad very very broad

610
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
what is it you don't agree with with

611
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
respect to the application is your view

612
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,120
not reflected and in fact there are very

613
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
few views that have been adopted by

614
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
states that are not reflected the the

615
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
most significant being the united

616
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,039
kingdom's view that there is no such

617
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
thing as a rule of sovereignty but as

618
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,799
you know every other state that's spoken

619
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,400
directly to the issue says no you're

620
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
wrong of course there's a rule okay so

621
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
so the success was the lack of threat we

622
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,840
weren't

623
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
forcing because joanna's right when when

624
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
it first started coming out

625
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,720
the the the people in the us dod were

626
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
freaked out

627
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
oh my god we got a bunch of academics

628
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
that don't even know what a submarine

629
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
cable is and they're going to start

630
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,640
writing this and we're going to be

631
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
forced to respond to the talon manual

632
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
but they never were so that's an

633
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
excellent point right so the issue is

634
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
what exactly provokes either state

635
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
endorsement of a project like this one

636
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,799
or an allergic reaction by a state to a

637
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,600
project like this one um and if we look

638
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
at for example you know yellowness here

639
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
if we look at what the icrc has done you

640
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
know with similar projects in the past

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,559
the one project that has probably been

642
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
by far the most successful is the

643
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
customer law study the customer ihl

644
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,159
study

645
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,960
which has similarities

646
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,360
not necessarily in in this this attempt

647
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,000
to reflect every position that's out

648
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,279
there

649
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,520
but you know in this kind of general

650
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
framing and the idea that there's this

651
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,320
whole body of state practice

652
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
that is verifiable and that people can

653
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,840
check

654
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
as a source of the rules even though

655
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
nobody checks

656
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,919
like so if you look at how it's actually

657
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,279
being used in practice people cite rules

658
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,559
they don't look at the

659
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,400
the practice it is the idea that there

660
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,919
is something to check

661
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,440
that works rather than the actual

662
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
operational reality of it

663
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
so let's now then move to the question

664
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,600
of why we think

665
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
some states love it

666
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
and some states maybe don't hate it but

667
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,919
certainly don't love it

668
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
one state that has

669
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,480
resisted sort of the manual's influence

670
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,039
but has also resisted similar projects

671
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,799
historically has been the united states

672
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,520
so let's talk a bit about that in a

673
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,799
completely non-controversial way

674
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,360
why do we think

675
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,880
there is this kind of inherent

676
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,240
resistance

677
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
to an effort like this one by the united

678
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
states uh so mike you're americans

679
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,840
they're going to speak second uh johanna

680
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,200
do you want do you want to say something

681
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,679
about this

682
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
look i i think

683
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
there's a couple of things first of all

684
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,559
i i think there is um

685
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,200
the fact that the us is perhaps one of

686
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
the most mature countries in thinking

687
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,279
about the application of international

688
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,679
law to cyber maybe not necessarily

689
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,400
publicly uh it hasn't

690
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,880
although the gge positions are now out

691
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
and there are several seminal speeches

692
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,320
that have been made

693
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
and there is a hesitancy

694
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
as countries are formulating their

695
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
positions the u.s wants countries to

696
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,919
formulate their positions right and so

697
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,880
there is a hesitancy for other projects

698
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
which put a whole bunch of positions on

699
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,919
the table

700
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,039
um

701
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
but i think that is also reflective of

702
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,799
the fact that if that is the case then

703
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,720
the us needs to be much more public

704
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
about their positions in the first place

705
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
and also the rationale for their

706
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,480
positions so

707
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,600
you know i i think there's that

708
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,039
i have i i think also the and mike

709
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,520
you're being very um self-deprecating

710
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
but the the point about um submarine

711
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,799
cables um and and understanding the

712
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,159
technology

713
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,480
there is always in this space when you

714
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
engage a a element of condescension if

715
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,799
you are from the outside engaging with

716
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,360
people who work and operate on the

717
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,640
inside you can't possibly understand

718
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,039
what it is actually like what what we

719
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,760
are actually doing what we are actually

720
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,360
confronting

721
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
and that's in part why yesterday i was

722
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
talking about transparency because i

723
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,919
think if you want to have sensible

724
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,679
conversations we need to actually

725
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,640
understand more what is going on

726
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
um but then there is also

727
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,520
um an an obligation for states who are

728
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
doing this uh to engage with groups of

729
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,520
experts who may have security clearances

730
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
um to to drive sensitive conversations

731
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,679
um and inform those conversations again

732
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,039
that that really is a transparency point

733
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,000
um

734
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
i think the

735
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
the point that mike was making about um

736
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,279
the talent manual not necessarily

737
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,520
representing definitive this is the

738
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
answer

739
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,400
is definitely the key uh to uh its

740
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,159
popularity um because every country

741
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,360
in the world

742
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,840
and i i really can say that

743
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
i think i've probably spoken to

744
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
representatives from almost every

745
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
country in the world

746
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,120
is grappling with how do we

747
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
respond to regulation of technologies

748
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,320
how does international law apply and so

749
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,080
every country is looking for answers but

750
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
every country has different national

751
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
circumstances

752
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
every country brings a different legal

753
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,039
tradition to it and so being able to

754
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,960
have something that isn't presenting the

755
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,440
answer but allows them to look and

756
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
understand what other people other

757
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
countries more specifically are thinking

758
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,240
about these things goes to that point of

759
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
it allows countries to formulate their

760
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,799
independent view we're not dictating a

761
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,760
view we're saying these are the uh the

762
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
positions that exist and i think that

763
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,760
formulate an independent view certainly

764
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,360
we've we've done capacity building which

765
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
i think we'll talk about later but that

766
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,360
is very much um why the talon manual has

767
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
been something particularly that smaller

768
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
and medium-sized states i think value a

769
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
lot and then of course for smaller

770
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,240
countries

771
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
even though the manual is not super

772
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
prescriptive

773
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
it nonetheless provides them on a

774
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
platter

775
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
a menu of options they can choose from

776
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
sometimes framed in a particular

777
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,880
conceptual way

778
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,399
you know like the rule of sovereignty

779
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,640
you know there's a territorial effect or

780
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,559
there's just a patient of an inherently

781
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,080
governmental function

782
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
that

783
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,600
is not intrinsically right or wrong if

784
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
you see what i mean but was devised by

785
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,600
the experts and suddenly gets validated

786
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
and adopted by states because it sounds

787
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
reasonable to them

788
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,399
and in that sense if you're a small

789
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
country you don't have a big legal

790
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,559
department it's just easy we like this

791
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,399
yeah but you can also see why so

792
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,960
sovereignty a country like the uk might

793
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
go oh i don't really like the idea of a

794
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
talent manual 3.0 writing about

795
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,760
sovereignty and pointing out that we're

796
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,279
the only country that says it's not a

797
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,559
rule

798
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,360
and it's a factual statement right

799
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,480
and this again i i don't think that is a

800
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,559
downside i think it's a positive because

801
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,440
it requires the uk then to step up and

802
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
say well this again to justify their

803
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,559
position and uh to articulate it and and

804
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,799
who knows maybe they will be so eloquent

805
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,559
in their articulation that telemannial

806
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,679
4.0 reflects a different direction

807
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,000
um but but you can you know you can

808
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,520
understand why countries might sort of

809
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
go oh that's a bit uncomfortable i mean

810
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,679
i will say on the uk thing this is an

811
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,960
important point

812
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
uh because of course they have taken

813
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,799
this this view they're very much an

814
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
island in fact and in law

815
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
but um

816
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
we're committed if there's if there's

817
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
any question whether or not the uk

818
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,000
position will be presented as a

819
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
reasonable question or a reasonable

820
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
position let me assure you it will be

821
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,039
there and in all likelihood

822
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,000
either marco or i will go down to fcdo

823
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,720
or to the mod and say this is your

824
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
position we want to make sure we get it

825
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,399
right

826
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,200
so is this a fair reflection there is a

827
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
we did this in tallinn too

828
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,440
with the us the united states has a very

829
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
strange position

830
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,720
where

831
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,279
they believe that the threshold for a

832
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
violation of the use of force under the

833
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,360
u.n charter article 2-4 happens to be

834
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,159
the same as the threshold for unarmed

835
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,279
attack that triggers the right of

836
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,360
self-defense under article 51. now i

837
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,200
think that's simply wrong i've written

838
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
many times that i don't agree with the

839
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,679
us position however when we were writing

840
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
the manual i went to someone at state

841
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
and said listen i know this is your

842
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
position we're committed to reflecting

843
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,960
all views and in a fair way and

844
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,520
that person she actually wrote the

845
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
paragraph that you see in the manual and

846
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
so you know we're committed to not

847
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
telling states they're wrong but rather

848
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,600
reflecting their views and then simply

849
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,080
giving a sense of of where of where the

850
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,440
experts are

851
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,760
can i ask a question on that so what is

852
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,840
what are the mechanisms for states to

853
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,880
provide input into talon 3.0 yeah this

854
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
is very good

855
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,799
it's an important question um sorry

856
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,399
mocha so

857
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,919
um

858
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,159
so everyone everyone in this room can go

859
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,799
online to the ccdcoe website and you can

860
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
make suggestions for alterations there's

861
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
because we're trying to crowdsource and

862
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
that includes governments not many

863
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
people have have done that so i

864
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,760
encourage everyone from there they like

865
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
to feel special what's that they like to

866
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,919
feel special that is true we know that

867
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,200
yeah so uh so there is that and it's by

868
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
the way it's a non-attribution so we're

869
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,080
not going to say we have this

870
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
recommendation it was by yelena

871
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
uh the second way there is a formal way

872
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,039
and we did it during tall and tuned we

873
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,799
probably will do it with tall and three

874
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,799
and eve and even more robust and that's

875
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,440
the state engagement process

876
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,919
we haven't talked about process yet but

877
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,880
near the end we will have drafts of all

878
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,120
the chapters ready to go

879
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,440
and we will look for a state sponsor

880
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,519
last time it was the netherlands hence

881
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,120
the term some of you have heard of the

882
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,559
hague process

883
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,600
the netherlands the mfa graciously

884
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,840
convened states that by the way the tall

885
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
and manual people had nothing to do with

886
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,919
it it was all done by the netherlands to

887
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,240
bring uh states in the p

888
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,919
they came once

889
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,760
states found it very valuable so the

890
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,600
netherlands arranged two more meetings

891
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
the p5 appeared every single time

892
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
australia was there every single time

893
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,840
they

894
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,159
commented on our drafts with we had a

895
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,919
few experts there so we could discuss

896
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,080
the comments and by the way there were a

897
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,440
lot of people the

898
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
russians sent three the chinese had a

899
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
delegation i think a five and and so

900
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,960
forth

901
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,039
and then we allowed them to also provide

902
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
written comments and and that was

903
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,840
actually a shock because we got and i'm

904
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,640
not exaggerating we got thousands of

905
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,799
comments because what we did was we said

906
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,039
here's the draft do the little it's a

907
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,799
word doc do little balloons and so lisa

908
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
and i spent

909
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,559
weeks and weeks what's that be careful

910
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,919
what you wish be careful what you wish

911
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
for but many of them were very very good

912
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
uh canada uh

913
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,159
you know

914
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,120
spectacular literally we think this word

915
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,159
is better than that word this is why and

916
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,840
so states will be allowed to do that

917
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
when i say it's more robust we will be

918
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
looking for states to sponsor that and

919
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
in my perfect universe we'll be doing

920
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,559
that on a regional basis so i don't know

921
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,039
i'm just making this up maybe australia

922
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,000
would host uh something in in the asean

923
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,640
region or the indo-pacific and maybe the

924
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
netherlands will agree to host again and

925
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
they will do so

926
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
you know for europe eurasia and maybe

927
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,360
canada will do it for the americas so

928
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
we'd like to do regional because what we

929
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,679
found in the capacity building program

930
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,360
that your country and you personally uh

931
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,519
uh are involved with or we're involved

932
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,159
with is that regions tend to think alike

933
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
so it's really valuable to get

934
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
a bunch of

935
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,879
folks from south of the border if you

936
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,800
will together in a room because they

937
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,399
have common interests common

938
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,119
perspectives they know each other so

939
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,199
they're comfortable so hopefully there's

940
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,599
that additionally

941
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,719
if a state or an organization

942
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,359
wishes to contact us in advance because

943
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,119
some states and canada is a real good

944
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
example canada they were super engaged

945
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,599
and if canada wanted to provide comments

946
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,000
on tallinn too since we're revising that

947
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
so they've already got the draft we're

948
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,679
revising but for the chapters

949
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
then they can reach out to myself or

950
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,918
marco or lee's and

951
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,760
either provide written comments i've

952
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,119
already got

953
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,560
some

954
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,160
or or in some cases marco or i or leaves

955
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
will fly down and meet with their legal

956
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
advisors and so we can have a talk all

957
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
of that all state engagement all state

958
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,640
engagement is absolute non-attribution

959
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
the only time we attribute to a state is

960
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
when a state has made a formal statement

961
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
so in the case of australia your

962
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,480
international engagement strategy annex

963
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,359
that will be cited but nothing that i

964
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,760
discuss for example with you in the day

965
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
or with toby would ever make it into the

966
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,800
manual has the position of australia

967
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
it's interesting to see in parallel

968
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
these these official attempts by states

969
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,520
to shape opinions in the development of

970
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,960
the law through for example these

971
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,200
statements and this academic project

972
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
sort of coexisting in parallel

973
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
and you know the whole idea of some

974
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
states resisting or not liking

975
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,040
a project like this one it really makes

976
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
no sense if they're not making their

977
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,640
positions publicly known if there's

978
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,119
nothing to rival the manual as there was

979
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,359
nothing to rival the manual how can you

980
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,359
sort of object to the idea

981
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
of developing and applying international

982
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
law to this right well i have an answer

983
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
it will be difficult do it because uh

984
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,200
because i've asked that question you

985
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,079
know uh early the americans were really

986
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,119
imposed early on and it's why are you so

987
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,240
opposed i mean i've worked for the

988
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,720
department of defense for four decades

989
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
not four years four decades i've worked

990
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
for the apartment offense like i'm not a

991
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,240
i'm not a bad guy you know why are you

992
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,440
so nervous

993
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,480
and

994
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
there are reasons oh this is they're

995
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,480
getting ahead of us but a number of

996
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,560
people have said to me it's because we

997
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
value ambiguity in this space yes we

998
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
value ambiguity clarity is not good

999
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,599
because

1000
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,520
especially since we don't know the way

1001
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,440
the technology is going uh we don't know

1002
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
what our nationality and this project by

1003
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
its very definition is is trying to

1004
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,240
limit them

1005
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
whatever it does absolutely right so you

1006
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
wonder why some states have not produced

1007
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
statements or they've not produced

1008
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
robust statements or they've produced a

1009
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
statement that puppets the rule but

1010
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,040
without any rationale or without

1011
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
discussing what the thresholds are

1012
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,520
because they value ambiguity

1013
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,000
and it's interesting some states

1014
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,480
are exactly the opposite

1015
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
some states say no no no no we need

1016
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,119
clarity and if you're looking at which

1017
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,200
states they are at the receiving end of

1018
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
cyber operations if you're are you a

1019
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,920
target or are you an operator are you

1020
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,680
offensive or defensive that drives uh

1021
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
drives the perspective a lot the problem

1022
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,359
is is and i've told

1023
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
very close friends this the problem with

1024
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,599
your ambiguity argument is ambiguity is

1025
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,880
dangerous

1026
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
okay it's dangerous because if you're

1027
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,920
facing a bad a bad actor

1028
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,839
russia i mean we've just had a session

1029
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,079
on on russia if you're facing russia

1030
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,680
listen they have really good lawyers out

1031
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,079
in russia really really good ones what

1032
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,800
the russians do in cyberspace and more

1033
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
generally in armed conflict because i'm

1034
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
an ihl guy so experts

1035
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,119
will probably agree with me what the

1036
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,839
russians do is they find the gray zone

1037
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,160
they look for the gray zone and that's

1038
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
the zone in which they operate so the

1039
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,040
classic example

1040
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,079
is

1041
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,599
election interference if you look what

1042
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,960
the russians did in the american

1043
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
elections

1044
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
a very study

1045
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,280
they did nothing that would crystal

1046
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,200
clear be intervention in the internal

1047
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,839
affairs of the united states or be a

1048
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,160
crystal clear violation of sovereignty

1049
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
at least for those states that agree

1050
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,119
with sovereignty

1051
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,200
like changing election returns or like

1052
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,720
manipulating election machinery making

1053
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
it uh not work at all no they they

1054
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,079
operated in that sweet spot that made it

1055
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,040
hard for the united states to a

1056
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,880
name and shame them for a violation of

1057
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
international law in a specific role and

1058
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
b

1059
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,079
considered the option of countermeasures

1060
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,440
because

1061
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
many states

1062
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,040
netherlands would be a really good

1063
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,839
example netherlands is a state that is

1064
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,680
focused on international law in a huge

1065
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,359
way and they're going to be very very

1066
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,200
very cautious in their response not to

1067
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,000
do anything that might be styled

1068
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,480
as a violation of international law so

1069
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,720
paul paul i think we'll get to you now

1070
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
and let's move to sort of big picture

1071
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
question of talent three yeah

1072
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,079
um

1073
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,560
if we take the premise

1074
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,440
that less ambiguity is a good thing

1075
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,200
and that clarifying international laws

1076
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
that applies to cyber is a good thing

1077
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,599
which probably most people in this room

1078
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,960
would

1079
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,160
what would you like to see in talon 3

1080
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
that's not in talent 2.

1081
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
so

1082
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,359
what would you be your suggestions to us

1083
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,800
for example

1084
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,160
on

1085
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,280
you know

1086
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,599
the the either the flaws in the existing

1087
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,920
manual or the gaps in the existing

1088
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
manual that you think need need filling

1089
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,000
yeah what i would like to see uh

1090
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,320
and and to add to the

1091
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,960
to the point of departure that states

1092
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
make international law

1093
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,119
is there's others there's other bodies

1094
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,200
that also contribute to international

1095
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,319
law and i'm referring to tribunals and

1096
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,160
and courts

1097
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,280
so what i

1098
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,800
expect to see

1099
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,760
uh

1100
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,599
and and it remains to be seen whether

1101
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,160
that will happen or not is uh there will

1102
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
be cases brought to courts related to

1103
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
the issues mentioned and addressed in

1104
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
the telling manual

1105
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
and and the jurisprudence coming from

1106
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,280
that will be relevant because it it will

1107
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,599
give us direction whether the

1108
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,680
international group of experts

1109
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,119
on on its own uh had a fair view of what

1110
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,400
the law

1111
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
was or what we thought the law was at

1112
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,400
the time

1113
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
or whether that has changed or whether

1114
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,119
we were wrong uh whether we whether the

1115
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,440
rules the the black letter rules should

1116
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
be amended or in in the discussion part

1117
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,920
it should be added with uh other views

1118
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
supplementary to those that are already

1119
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,560
there that is one thing so i expect case

1120
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,240
law to come forward

1121
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,920
um not in a not in the direct meaning

1122
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,440
only but also

1123
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
by looking at indictments

1124
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,480
uh looking at state practice so sanction

1125
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,640
regimes for instance looking at the eu

1126
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,800
cyber diplomacy toolbox and how that is

1127
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,119
applied when is it applied why is it

1128
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,400
applied

1129
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,160
how is that done

1130
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,040
and what does it mean for for for the

1131
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
the rules and the discussion and the the

1132
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,079
other views expressed in the manual

1133
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,319
and the

1134
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,880
what i'm quite interesting

1135
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
what will be quite interesting and then

1136
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,640
going back to yesterday's uh

1137
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,480
presentation by uh

1138
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,640
commander of u.s cyber command

1139
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,000
and the nsa

1140
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,720
was his reference to uh hunt forward and

1141
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,119
persistent engagement and that strategy

1142
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,440
exercised by by the united states

1143
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,560
has a clear impact on international law

1144
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
uh i'm pretty

1145
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,079
pretty anxious to learn

1146
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,400
how that strategy is perceived

1147
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
uh by those states that are impacted by

1148
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,680
by the strategy and its application

1149
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
i don't know whether we'll

1150
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,280
it will surface

1151
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,319
i don't know but it might it might just

1152
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
surface one way or the other

1153
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,960
uh so your point about the case law if i

1154
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
may come back to it there is one branch

1155
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,119
of international law

1156
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,960
where there is more and more and more

1157
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
case law essentially by the daily basis

1158
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
and the human rights law yes that's the

1159
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,319
that's the other that's the final thing

1160
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,079
and we definitely want to develop the

1161
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,079
human rights portion of the of the of

1162
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,960
the manual yeah now the one problem here

1163
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,359
and it's a major problem is that if you

1164
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
look at how case law for example on

1165
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,520
online speech or online privacy looks

1166
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,720
like today

1167
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
99 of it comes from the european court

1168
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,160
of human rights

1169
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,079
so the inter-american court the african

1170
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,000
court even the u.n treaty bodies they

1171
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,760
haven't yet had the cases for various

1172
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,680
reasons you know it takes a long time to

1173
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,359
litigate something domestically and then

1174
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,200
to get it to one of these international

1175
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,560
jurisdictions to litigate it through

1176
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,520
that and so we will capture that case

1177
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
law but we run the risk of having a

1178
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,040
massive

1179
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,800
european bias

1180
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,880
to it yeah and we will have to find a

1181
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,040
way to avoid that yeah

1182
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,560
somehow yeah

1183
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,119
well the trick i think you're exactly

1184
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,480
right because an american would say oh

1185
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
that's nice yeah

1186
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
yeah

1187
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,319
and along with the other problems of

1188
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,880
human rights extra territoriality if you

1189
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,560
agree that the obligation that's

1190
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,640
territorial what does that mean you've

1191
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,800
you've written the book on that that

1192
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,960
subject but with regard to the case law

1193
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
from the european court i think one of

1194
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
the things that can do is treat it as a

1195
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,359
view

1196
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,000
so if you if you are

1197
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,440
if you swear in a stack of bibles in

1198
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,119
front of 10 bishops that you're going to

1199
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,359
express all reasonable views then you

1200
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,520
must express that view but you need only

1201
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,160
express it as a view

1202
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,839
and then look for and look for

1203
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,920
alternatives to that view as well and

1204
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,480
present them yes but you're right you're

1205
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,640
right and that is by the way that was a

1206
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,480
criticism of the first manuscript

1207
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
criticism all the manuals but the first

1208
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,720
one in particular was seen as i remember

1209
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,400
when the first one came out in 2013

1210
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,680
uh in brussels uh there was a flail x

1211
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,960
because uh everyone was interpreting

1212
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,760
that as nato doctrine

1213
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,720
and

1214
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,119
uh and of course nato it wasn't nato

1215
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,599
doctrine it was 20 people uh that

1216
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,920
happened to be at a center at that time

1217
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
wasn't even called the nato ccdcoe was

1218
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,520
called the ccdcoe the term nato came

1219
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,079
later and so there was great criticism

1220
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
that this was the view of nato and so

1221
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,280
there was um

1222
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,240
an effort made to diversify the experts

1223
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,800
and so we had a chinese scholar someone

1224
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,960
from belarus there's the issue of actual

1225
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,680
bias and then there's the apparent bias

1226
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,079
and both undermine the authority and

1227
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,560
persuasiveness of the manual so johanna

1228
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,319
what would your views be on this and and

1229
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,599
how to sort of

1230
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,640
avoid these pitfalls so i i will come to

1231
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,599
that but i actually want to come back to

1232
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,200
this point about ambiguity because i

1233
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,240
think it's an

1234
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,280
important point and

1235
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,560
the idea that strategic ambiguity is a

1236
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,079
benefit for us and by this i mean uh

1237
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,920
nato countries five eyes partners etc

1238
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
i think is an outdated concept

1239
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,640
if you look back at the evolution of

1240
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,880
international law uh in this space or

1241
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,480
even look back at the evolution of u.n

1242
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,160
discussions in this space

1243
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,800
it was the russians who initiated these

1244
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
conversations because they wanted to

1245
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,720
constrain us

1246
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,760
because they saw us advancing in terms

1247
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,839
of technological capability and they

1248
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,760
were worried and they wanted you know

1249
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,319
they've been championing a treaty

1250
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,960
because they initially wanted to be

1251
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,720
constraining us

1252
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,119
i think we need to face the reality that

1253
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,119
the tables have turned

1254
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,480
and actually

1255
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,040
we need to constrain them

1256
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,079
and so i just don't think the argument

1257
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,920
of strategic ambiguity stands any longer

1258
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,359
and i don't and i think the idea that we

1259
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,560
will agree rules that russia and china

1260
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,599
won't

1261
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,240
stand up won't agree or abide by

1262
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,000
i think we actually need to interrogate

1263
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,400
that i don't know that the evidence

1264
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,200
supports that if you look at what russia

1265
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,240
is doing

1266
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
in terms of provocation absolutely they

1267
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,680
have violated international law uh by

1268
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,359
invading ukraine right they've shown a

1269
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,640
disregard

1270
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,520
but in terms of provoking nato they are

1271
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,160
dancing right up to your lines and

1272
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,079
they're not crossing them and that is a

1273
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,800
strategic decision that they are making

1274
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,640
because they have decided that they will

1275
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,240
take ukraine but they don't want to take

1276
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
on nato

1277
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
so this idea that

1278
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,640
we will be constrained and they won't i

1279
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,319
don't know that it stands and you look

1280
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,319
at the china you know in the context of

1281
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
china china actually cares about its

1282
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
international reputation and

1283
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
what it how it is perceived particularly

1284
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,880
if we end up in situations where cases

1285
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
are being litigated and and you know the

1286
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,319
very excellent panel that we had uh just

1287
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,079
uh just before on the conflict in

1288
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,480
ukraine and the references there to the

1289
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,000
preparations that are already being made

1290
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,559
with respect to icc cases

1291
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,040
you know i i again there's an easy it's

1292
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,920
easy to dismiss this because it doesn't

1293
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,880
necessarily prevent things happening but

1294
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,800
that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a

1295
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,280
very real impact on the behavior of

1296
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,319
states

1297
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,480
and so i i really would i know it's a

1298
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,160
controversial position but i really

1299
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
would challenge everyone from government

1300
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,000
in this room to really have a think

1301
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,319
about whether that position of strategic

1302
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,960
ambiguity actually still stands uh

1303
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,359
because i don't think it does and i say

1304
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,200
this as someone who has been on the

1305
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,240
inside who has extensive engagement with

1306
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,839
all of the agencies who do this stuff

1307
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,119
this is not a position of of

1308
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,040
naive idealism

1309
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,960
one problem isn't it

1310
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,640
with this regard is that when we speak

1311
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,480
of governments having a view or states

1312
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,559
having a view it is actually multiple

1313
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,160
different individuals and agencies

1314
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
within these states that have used

1315
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,760
sometimes they're diverging and the

1316
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,680
state really cannot agree on a single

1317
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,400
view i i think not even that i i would i

1318
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,280
don't think you would find any state uh

1319
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,359
in nato or the five eyes who doesn't

1320
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,839
have fierce disagreements among

1321
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,920
interagencies on these issues without

1322
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,240
question

1323
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,200
and

1324
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,839
to the extent you're able to say this

1325
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,240
how do you think these disagreements map

1326
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,319
out on say foreign ministries versus

1327
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,559
cyber agencies versus

1328
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,160
defense people go easy

1329
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,640
again totally non-controversial i can i

1330
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,559
dare to answer um i i'm you know

1331
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,839
if

1332
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,480
let's look at intelligence agencies uh

1333
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
intelligence and security agencies uh

1334
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,960
the mod and and the ministry of foreign

1335
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,480
affairs but even within the ministry of

1336
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,319
foreign affairs there's different views

1337
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,400
there's the yeah there's a human rights

1338
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,880
department there's the national security

1339
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,640
related department and that's the

1340
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,000
political department the legal

1341
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800
department so so even within the mfa

1342
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,839
there's already divergent views

1343
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,839
i would say that initially

1344
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,079
the mod

1345
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,599
is willing to find some leeway

1346
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,319
to to be able to conduct operations

1347
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,040
within the law but the ministry of

1348
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,760
foreign affairs would be the one uh

1349
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,440
looking at international relations and

1350
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,480
so on and would mitigate that that view

1351
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,720
let's put it like that

1352
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,800
i think there's also what i've

1353
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,280
encountered what paul said 100 on every

1354
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
country i've worked with

1355
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,200
i think there's also since the audience

1356
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,319
consists of a lot of lawyers

1357
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,680
within government

1358
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,440
there's a lot of difference of opinion

1359
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,960
on what the role of the government

1360
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,880
attorney is the one providing legal

1361
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,960
advice and you know

1362
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,480
since i come from a military background

1363
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,000
there are those

1364
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,240
who believe that their job is to

1365
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,720
tell the commander why he or she can do

1366
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,839
something

1367
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,599
and then there's the other

1368
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,520
in other words the commander is my

1369
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,319
client so what do you want to do boss

1370
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,440
okay i

1371
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,200
think i can get you there

1372
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
and then there are attorneys who believe

1373
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,559
themselves to be legal advisors my job

1374
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,960
and i will tell you i'm in this camp my

1375
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,880
job is to give you an objective

1376
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,800
assessment of the law

1377
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,079
so you can assess legal risks if it's a

1378
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,559
gray area i want to tell you it's gray

1379
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,200
so that you can say what's the blowback

1380
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,640
going to be and

1381
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,280
what's the law fair uh effect of this

1382
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,839
particular operation so when i work with

1383
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,000
with military organizations in my

1384
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,559
country or other countries i see this

1385
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,359
really playing out you know the people

1386
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,760
that want to tell their boss yes they

1387
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,480
love ambiguity and the others they want

1388
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,040
to give their boss the best legal advice

1389
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,280
and the more clarity there is the better

1390
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,040
able they are this will really vary

1391
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,280
depending on national legal culture and

1392
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,200
institutional culture absolutely a great

1393
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,440
extent johanna so

1394
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,760
i think a lot of this was um what i was

1395
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,000
pointing to in my my speech yesterday so

1396
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,440
i don't want to repeat myself too much

1397
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,800
but there's two points i would i would

1398
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,359
make one is that the fact that we now

1399
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,440
have military commanders standing on a

1400
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
stage talking about defending the

1401
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
international rules-based order

1402
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,200
i think is a signal that uh the tensions

1403
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,520
that exist naturally between foreign

1404
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,720
ministries and defence ministries and

1405
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,480
the armed forces as distinct from the

1406
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
defence ministries

1407
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
is starting to come together that we are

1408
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,640
actually starting to pull together for

1409
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
the same thing so that

1410
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,400
i will be very interested to see how

1411
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,359
that impacts the legal debate

1412
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,400
and then

1413
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,800
to your point about

1414
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,559
the distinction between foreign

1415
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
ministries defense ministries

1416
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,520
intelligence agencies this really goes

1417
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,160
to the argument i was making yesterday

1418
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
yesterday about being

1419
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,960
distinct in what we're describing and

1420
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,359
talking about intelligence agencies are

1421
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,680
intelligence agencies spies are going to

1422
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,000
spy they are going to do what they do

1423
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,520
and they're not going to be public about

1424
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,599
it and we don't want them to right that

1425
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,680
that's and is there an intelligence

1426
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,040
agency

1427
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,520
um but the operations that are being

1428
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,359
conducted by defense forces and military

1429
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,280
military um

1430
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
cyber operations in support of military

1431
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,160
operations is an entirely different

1432
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,400
kettle of fish and in my experience when

1433
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,599
you're talking with defense folks

1434
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,760
and particularly people in uniform the

1435
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,240
conversation around things like the

1436
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,520
application of ihl etc becomes actually

1437
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,839
a really interesting in-depth

1438
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,200
conversation

1439
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
the challenge of course is that a lot of

1440
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,960
the activity that we're looking to

1441
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,440
constrain behavior for doesn't happen

1442
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,319
within the ihl room it happens below the

1443
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,599
threshold

1444
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,760
because they're dancing right up to it

1445
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
and this is why you know people keep

1446
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,760
talking about we the gray zone

1447
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,119
activities um russia china all of this

1448
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,119
this uh activity that is happening in

1449
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,599
this space why does it keep happening in

1450
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,200
my view that's in part because we're

1451
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,520
allowing the ambiguity to perpetuate

1452
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,680
we're not actually saying this is

1453
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,160
unacceptable and if you cross this line

1454
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,800
there will be consequences now i know

1455
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,400
that those of you who are operators in

1456
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
the room will say well we don't we also

1457
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
do stuff and we don't want us we don't

1458
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,839
want to be constrained and that's where

1459
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,200
having a skillful informed conversation

1460
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,520
with your lawyers comes in uh really

1461
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,359
handy um and so

1462
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,400
i i actually am hopeful uh that the

1463
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,480
shift that we have seen and the way that

1464
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
these issues are being spoken about and

1465
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,880
if there is you know one

1466
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,400
positive that can come out of the

1467
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,680
horrendous situation in in ukraine it is

1468
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
that hopefully people

1469
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,800
will be

1470
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,000
more rallying behind the idea that uh

1471
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the existing rules based order is

1472
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,160
something that we all need to fight to

1473
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,000
be upholding and i think this is part of

1474
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
it and it's also interesting to look at

1475
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,920
the issue of constraint when you simply

1476
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,800
don't have that us versus them dynamics

1477
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,319
when you have rules of international

1478
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,760
that protect for example individual

1479
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,920
interests or community interests so if

1480
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,280
we're going to discuss human rights in

1481
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,880
the talent manual it's normally the

1482
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,160
state what can the state can do to its

1483
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,440
own people

1484
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,760
you know on online censorship mass

1485
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,440
surveillance of its own population not

1486
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,200
consider the population of other states

1487
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,359
and just on that us versus them uh

1488
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,520
triviality i would say that

1489
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
part of the the shift in the public

1490
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,599
conversation for me gives me hope that

1491
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,119
we move beyond

1492
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,200
us versus them domestically among

1493
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,440
agencies having these rights to us

1494
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,000
versus our adversaries the actual them

1495
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,799
yeah exactly yeah and and i hope that

1496
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,319
drives that conversation good i think

1497
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,880
this is a very nice point to end our

1498
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,920
chat

1499
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,160
uh temporarily and to open it up for

1500
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,520
questions so i i hope you know this this

1501
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,160
uh this inspired you to think about the

1512
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,760
question to you but maybe also to to

1513
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
joanna

1514
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,799
well thanks for all the work on the

1515
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,119
talent manual i lose use it a lot in all

1516
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,760
the research

1517
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,160
one of the

1518
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,720
ambitions of the manual was look here's

1519
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,319
the manual

1520
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,400
we all agree that international law

1521
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,640
applies to cyberspace

1522
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
but how does it apply

1523
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
so states

1524
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,760
come up with your

1525
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,599
legal opinion

1526
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,200
show us some state behavior

1527
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,599
we are now

1528
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,160
a decade later years later

1529
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
now we have a lot of these legal

1530
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,279
opinions of states

1531
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,319
i don't know if that is a blessing

1532
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,480
because a lot of these legal opinions

1533
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,160
they diverge

1534
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,240
we have states that

1535
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,559
express their opinion some are not you

1536
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,400
mentioned them

1537
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,559
related to sovereignty

1538
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,200
some see it as a primary rule and a

1539
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,119
principle some as a principle you

1540
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,319
mentioned that

1541
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,640
within sovereignty when you see it as a

1542
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,240
primary there needs to be a question

1543
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,078
mark yes at the end it will yeah

1544
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,680
in sovereignty there are different

1545
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,040
interpretations of the rule of so

1546
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,760
basically you have a a paradox you ask

1547
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,839
for legal opinions then you get the

1548
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,079
legal opinions and then they diverge so

1549
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,440
how will you deal with that in the

1550
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,940
italian manual tree excellent thank you

1551
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,960
[Laughter]

1552
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,799
so be careful what you wish for i guess

1553
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,440
is the the question

1554
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,400
so i'm not so sure it is is a problem um

1555
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,240
the fact that the states have not

1556
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,280
explained their rationale behind the

1557
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,760
view and so forth i'm not sure it's a

1558
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,440
problem because first we can ask the

1559
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,599
states what's your rationale i mean you

1560
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,799
know the israelis in my field ihl the

1561
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,880
israelis have limited the notion of

1562
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,359
attack to a cyber operation that causes

1563
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,200
physical destruction or injury you know

1564
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,040
you're you're an expert in this field as

1565
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,599
well i intend to ask roy sherndoff the

1566
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,280
deputy attorney general so like roy that

1567
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,760
sounds crazy to me so

1568
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,839
respectfully respectfully

1569
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,040
what's the legal basis for that because

1570
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,799
i'm going to reflect the view in the

1571
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,920
manual uh and i want to make sure i

1572
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,520
capture that view

1573
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,760
the other thing is is i mean you know

1574
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,920
life is a journey of small steps and i

1575
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,599
don't expect

1576
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,400
pollen manual 3.0 to be the final

1577
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,520
version marco will do 4-0 and i will be

1578
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,000
in retirement in the south of france

1579
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
uh i've heard that before so so

1580
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,280
so uh i'm not concerned that for example

1581
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,440
taking sovereignty as an example that i

1582
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,319
can only say that there are two views

1583
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,119
and it seems that the weight of state

1584
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,240
opinion

1585
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,640
is in favor of the second view but the

1586
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,720
united kingdom takes this view and here

1587
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,440
is the view and so forth because i'm not

1588
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,880
trying to

1589
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,640
answer the questions for states i want

1590
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,559
to give states the material from which

1591
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,160
they can do the legal analysis

1592
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,960
themselves to decide what

1593
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,920
view what approach is in their own

1594
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,119
national interest and we do we mentioned

1595
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,720
the capacity building

1596
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,040
when australia and

1597
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,960
my friend joanna asked us to go out and

1598
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,920
do capacity building

1599
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,839
they were adamant the australians were

1600
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,920
adamant that we're not supposed to pitch

1601
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,920
a particular view but rather we are

1602
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,920
supposed to express all the views that

1603
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,839
are available and that it is up to

1604
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,160
states and and we've said many times to

1605
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,880
an audience in asean or somewhere else

1606
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,799
that the decision on which of these is

1607
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,280
the appropriate view is yours so i'm not

1608
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,040
horribly concerned because that's not

1609
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
what we're trying to accomplish

1610
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,200
with with the talon manual i hope that

1611
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,960
makes sense yeah i'm actually really

1612
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,400
excited that you asked this question

1613
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,240
because i have an answer that my lawyers

1614
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,520
when i was working for government told

1615
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,119
me i wasn't allowed to say publicly and

1616
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,559
now i don't work for government so i can

1617
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,240
say it um which is that um if you get a

1618
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,079
bunch of lawyers in the room which we do

1619
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,680
probably have here

1620
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,040
and asked them to formulate one single

1621
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,000
position on sovereignty just sovereignty

1622
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,079
not sovereignty and cyberspace you

1623
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,319
wouldn't be able to do it right because

1624
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,640
countries have different positions on

1625
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,000
sovereignty

1626
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,040
and so we're setting ourselves a bar in

1627
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,359
my opinion that is too high and it's

1628
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,680
that old trap of just because it's cyber

1629
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,839
we have to do it different and i don't

1630
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:05,040
think we do what we need is clarity

1631
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,079
because if you zoom right out what is

1632
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,400
the point of international law

1633
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
the point of international law is to

1634
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,880
allow states to coexist peacefully

1635
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,079
and

1636
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,400
what what allows you to do that is to

1637
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,119
understand where other countries lines

1638
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:23,920
are

1639
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
so the important thing is for us to

1640
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,119
understand not for us to agree with what

1641
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,880
russia and china's position on the

1642
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,440
application of ihl is it's great that we

1643
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,440
now agree that it does apply

1644
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,599
but it's for us to understand what

1645
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,760
russia and china's position on how it

1646
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,640
applies so that we make we can provide

1647
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,319
the advice to those who are making the

1648
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,599
decisions

1649
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,000
so that when we are making a decision

1650
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,359
about whether or not we are going to

1651
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,440
cross that line we actually know where

1652
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,240
the line is and at the moment we don't

1653
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,160
really know where those lines are and

1654
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,160
again that comes back to the point of is

1655
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,400
ambiguity actually in our interests in

1656
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,599
this uh any longer so i i really think

1657
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,000
the idea and and in part i think that's

1658
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,160
driven by the gge processes right we

1659
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,079
spend all of this time trying to agree

1660
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,880
common positions but i do i think the

1661
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,119
important thing at a

1662
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,680
uh global level is to agree

1663
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,319
that bodies of law apply and then the

1664
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,280
idea that we're all going to have a

1665
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,680
harmonized position i think is a little

1666
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,079
bit uh of a fantasy

1667
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,920
and it's not necessary for the body of

1668
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,839
law to actually achieve its main purpose

1669
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,040
so uh a question here and and and there

1670
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,640
is one on your back as well oh there's

1671
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,000
two more excellent it's a

1672
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,839
just very briefly and probably to marco

1673
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,880
and mike as the as the general editors

1674
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,480
to move the conversation away from law

1675
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,400
just for a moment towards the tech side

1676
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,680
one of the reasons i think telling

1677
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,319
manual 3.0 is needed

1678
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,079
not least because of the the flurry of

1679
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,760
cyber security statements that mike

1680
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,720
identified but also since 2017 the tech

1681
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,640
has developed so rapidly and i think

1682
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,480
covert has ushered in

1683
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,319
a lot of changes and transformations

1684
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,440
there particularly in the types of

1685
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,520
malicious activities that we see so i've

1686
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,359
got no doubt that the group of experts

1687
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,119
has got the international law covered

1688
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,280
for tally manual three my question would

1689
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,319
be

1690
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,920
examples that we

1691
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,359
that we've seen tally manual one and

1692
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,039
tally manual two and that those manuals

1693
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,720
have become quite famous for

1694
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,240
for the next tally man if we're tally

1695
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,839
manual three i think those examples need

1696
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,400
to be deepened to be complexified and

1697
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,480
there needs to be a lot of techy

1698
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,480
influence on the way those examples are

1699
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,240
crafted so my question is how are you

1700
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
going to cater for that in talent manual

1701
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,680
3.0

1702
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,799
cool you go ahead

1703
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,400
because you've got the lawyers right i

1704
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,359
mean you've got great group of

1705
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,039
international lawyers but what about the

1706
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,680
the tech um

1707
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,359
well i mean what we're going to do is

1708
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,680
exactly what we did the last time

1709
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,119
and the time before that

1710
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,720
we don't do

1711
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,400
anything without techies

1712
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,799
we lovingly call wireheads

1713
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,520
the wireheads and i don't know if he's

1714
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,839
in the room

1715
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,079
bernhard bloomberg anyways was our

1716
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,079
wirehead he was great he read every word

1717
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,319
many many times

1718
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,119
and he was great because he was the kind

1719
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,119
of techie that we could that could

1720
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,280
explain things to the lawyers in ways

1721
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,079
that we could kind of understand no mike

1722
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,000
a submarine cable doesn't have to do

1723
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,440
with a boat

1724
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,640
uh

1725
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,000
and so we will not do anything

1726
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,200
without having a a tech scrub

1727
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,079
uh and it's the responsibility of our

1728
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,240
technical advisor to ensure that we're

1729
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,760
using the right examples in the right

1730
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,280
way and i will tell you sometimes uh

1731
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,599
we call a mountain flower bloomberg

1732
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,839
sometimes mountain flower would come up

1733
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,680
with either hypothetical example or a

1734
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,799
real world example

1735
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,280
a hypothetical example or a real world

1736
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,280
example and then we would have to say no

1737
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
that's not reflective of the legal

1738
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,839
concept we haven't been clear but i

1739
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,440
think your point's well taken i don't

1740
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,960
expect many of the examples to survive i

1741
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,880
expect a technical team of course you

1742
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,799
know the ccd you know

1743
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,599
the ccdc has a technical branch they'll

1744
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,000
be helpful and we'll also have a tech

1745
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,559
advisor where

1746
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,880
if i may just add one thing though

1747
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,359
sometimes it's not the how it's done but

1748
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,839
the effects of what's done that legally

1749
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,440
is the most relevant thing so i'm not

1750
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,039
saying the tech is is not important to

1751
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,359
get me wrong but sometimes the exact way

1752
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,039
of doing it

1753
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,000
is immaterial legally and so i think a

1754
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,920
lot of the the manual stands the test of

1755
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,280
time in that sense

1756
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,119
and i would um the point i wanted to

1757
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,440
make is um reinforces that perfectly

1758
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,240
which is the tech has changed a lot

1759
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,520
since uh telemanny 2.0 but the tech is

1760
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,599
always changing and so if we tie

1761
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,520
ourselves up in knots to be tech

1762
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,400
specific um we're actually being it will

1763
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,400
be counterproductive so

1764
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,480
yes we need those examples that uh

1765
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,400
demonstrate the application case studies

1766
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,520
etc

1767
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,160
but i am a very very strong advocate for

1768
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,920
keeping international law and the space

1769
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,520
technology neutral because it really

1770
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,119
doesn't matter

1771
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,000
what

1772
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,280
what the tool the tech tool is that you

1773
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,240
are using to breach ihl for example no i

1774
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,680
i when you're looking at the principal

1775
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,680
level i really don't think it does i

1776
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,359
think it does affect the way that the

1777
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,920
operation might be carried out but not

1778
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,680
in terms of whether or not it's a breach

1779
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,440
of law and so

1780
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,559
we will

1781
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,880
be forever rewriting what we're doing if

1782
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,720
we're saying okay well this rule applies

1783
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,880
to lethal autonomous weapons and this

1784
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,000
rule applies to uh malware and this rule

1785
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,559
applies in this circumstance um and and

1786
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,720
i think there is also a risk that you

1787
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,799
end up having divergent positions that

1788
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,160
end up making i think we're all in

1789
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,119
agreement

1790
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,200
but i will give one example

1791
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,480
there's more questions no no there's a

1792
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,240
it's a really interesting point that

1793
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,160
russell makes i'll i'll do it very

1794
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,839
quickly because if you look at pollen

1795
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,280
one and tolerant two we did make one

1796
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,000
change based on technology and it had to

1797
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,680
do on what can you see what's coming

1798
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,200
through your pipes and it was the the

1799
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,359
principle of due diligence the rule of

1800
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,280
due diligence and intolerant one our

1801
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,200
tech expert told us can't see what's

1802
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,079
coming through your pipes it's

1803
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,920
impossible you have no well if you can't

1804
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,280
see what's coming with your pipes

1805
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,720
obviously don't have

1806
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,359
an obligation of due diligence to ensure

1807
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,160
blah blah blah blah blah tallinn too

1808
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,680
they said well the technology has

1809
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,160
reached the point where sometimes

1810
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,280
you can see so if you can understand

1811
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,799
what's coming through your pipes and

1812
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,960
sometimes you might actually be able to

1813
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,839
do something about it well this sparked

1814
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,240
a a revision you'll see we're much more

1815
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,720
tentative and tall and too in dismissing

1816
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,480
the rule application of the rule of due

1817
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,720
diligence altogether because now the

1818
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,599
technology had changed that forced us to

1819
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,079
change our rather

1820
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,119
you know

1821
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,079
definitive statement of law so i'm in

1822
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,200
agreement

1823
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,440
i'm with russell but we defined

1824
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,480
infrastructure

1825
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,520
in a proper and more uh detailed way in

1826
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,079
in two than it was define it in number

1827
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,480
one and and that was

1828
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,880
and by doing that we

1829
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,799
understood in a better way

1830
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,520
how it worked and and if you come to to

1831
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,720
apply those

1832
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,039
techniques into operations it's it's

1833
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,680
pretty relevant how it works so i'm i'm

1834
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,760
i'm fully agreeing we are all i think in

1835
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,079
agreement the basic point is the

1836
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,760
specifics like when we get to an actual

1837
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,760
specific example where we might disagree

1838
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,559
right so question here thank you

1839
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,200
violent agreement violently

1840
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,839
violent i'm curious for your takes on it

1841
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,000
seems like this is very state can you

1842
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,440
just introduce yourself i'm sorry gavin

1843
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,480
wild carnegie endowment for

1844
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,720
international peace um i'm curious for

1845
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,200
your takes on the degree how

1846
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,839
this process can be applicable in a

1847
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,920
universe in which a lot of the behaviors

1848
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,000
we're outlining are no longer the

1849
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,200
specific or exclusive remit of states

1850
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,960
in an environment where

1851
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,520
whether it's nso group or

1852
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,359
wagner or what have you where some of

1853
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,520
these behaviors are now outsourced to

1854
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
where the state and russia certainly can

1855
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,839
say this is not state activity but of

1856
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,000
course it it is and they're

1857
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,839
can i actually handle that so so i mean

1858
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,000
the manual already does that

1859
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,238
pretty reasonably well when it discusses

1860
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,520
the rules of attribution the law of

1861
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,920
state responsibility and it is a

1862
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,040
state-centric body of law and so that

1863
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,198
that i think that for example the issue

1864
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,640
of a state acting through a proxy

1865
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,960
non-state actor the current position of

1866
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,238
the manual

1867
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,158
does not really need much

1868
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,560
much improvement but where that issue

1869
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,960
really becomes terribly acute

1870
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,520
is in the human rights sphere

1871
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,759
where for example online speech and

1872
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,600
online privacy are actually controlled

1873
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,439
by corporate entities

1874
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,799
and only very rarely by by states

1875
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,560
and you will know for example that at

1876
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,040
the un level there's been this whole big

1877
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,600
business and human rights effort of

1878
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,198
trying to have companies not just in

1879
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,880
tech companies to internalize human

1880
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
rights law in their own decision making

1881
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
and we have seen companies do that so

1882
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
we've you know if you look at facebook

1883
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,238
decisions on

1884
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,719
donald trump or i don't know they're

1885
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,359
full of human rights law they use human

1886
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,839
rights jurisprudence the issue for us in

1887
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,920
the manual is

1888
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,640
how to articulate this kind of softish

1889
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,000
thing

1890
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,759
into something that's meant to be an

1891
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,719
encapsulation of binding law

1892
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,799
and the honest answer to you is that we

1893
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,479
don't yet know how exactly we're going

1894
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,279
to do that in that one particular sphere

1895
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,439
which is incredibly important but it's

1896
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,120
it's a major challenge

1897
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,319
uh so

1898
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,880
three questions here so let's do it like

1899
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,000
that

1900
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,920
there's also um a person sitting at the

1901
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,839
back here oh there's all the uniform

1902
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,359
people there yeah and they have been

1903
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,719
diligently raising their hands from the

1904
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,600
start uh okay so what we're going to do

1905
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
is now we're going to take the youngster

1906
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,880
we're going to take three questions and

1907
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
i'm going to take three questions more

1908
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,920
and then we shall survive or not so just

1909
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,800
be question marks

1910
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,840
at the beginning or at the end

1911
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,280
[Laughter]

1912
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
well uh thank you my name is pierre

1913
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,480
horvath and i'm from the ministry of

1914
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,000
foreign affairs of hungary

1915
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,320
with no legal background but at least uh

1916
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,280
international law enthusiast

1917
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,000
i really i really enjoyed uh the reading

1918
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,960
and talent manual and um um yeah just

1919
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,920
nerd you've just read it

1920
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,880
yeah

1921
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,199
got into it i've never done that before

1922
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,599
that's one

1923
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,199
just the two reflections on uh on on uh

1924
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,199
joanna's uh um

1925
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,600
what joanna said and and the first

1926
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,320
question uh so joanna you you said that

1927
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,600
uh the strategic ambiguity is over uh

1928
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,679
but the first reflection on what you

1929
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,080
said is uh that uh the the the sec the

1930
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,920
third uh example uh the third timeline

1931
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,920
menu is actually going to summarize what

1932
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,159
uh what actually happened after the

1933
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,159
adoption of the second one and it's

1934
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,000
going to summarize the different

1935
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,960
sometimes diverging

1936
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,199
practices

1937
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,080
adopted by by by nation states so my

1938
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,440
question is is the strategic ambiguity

1939
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,960
uh really over

1940
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,000
because

1941
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,880
we are going to uh you know refer to the

1942
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,960
third ma telemanual

1943
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,960
according to our wish uh when we unders

1944
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,440
when we have an agreement with with one

1945
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,679
uh you know position uh or whether the

1946
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,960
other but it can be different um so is

1947
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,000
it really over good so no no no no let's

1948
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,280
take three questions and then we do

1949
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,640
because we're running up to time sorry

1950
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,960
i'm being paranoid so two two people

1951
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,520
there it was we all furiously write down

1952
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,679
thank you very much my name is muhammad

1953
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,920
university of uh august

1954
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,960
germany

1955
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,440
and so when we talking about cyber space

1956
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,679
and international law it's like when

1957
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,239
we're talking about

1958
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,440
old bottles and new wine

1959
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,320
so

1960
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,800
the right question is not to

1961
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,679
to ask how can we put the new wine in

1962
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,920
the old bottles but

1963
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,280
if our of our new wine will test well

1964
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,719
after that

1965
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,600
after putting it in the old bottles so

1966
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,840
do you think

1967
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,080
that's the right way to assess cyber

1968
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,560
attacks in international law comparing

1969
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,760
them

1970
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,040
always

1971
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,920
to traditional attacks

1972
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,520
my second question is we all have seen

1973
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,560
different statements our state on how

1974
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,120
can international law apply

1975
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
to cyberspace

1976
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,440
so um does that mean

1977
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,679
we have right now an international law

1978
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,400
of a national nature in regard to

1979
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,840
cyberspace

1980
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,040
thank you

1981
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,440
so thank you thank you uh juliana

1982
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,239
schmidt the veterans cyber partisans uh

1983
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,239
i wanna have a follow-up question on

1984
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,000
non-state actors

1985
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,320
uh we know that there are activist

1986
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,560
groups uh ukrainian activist groups

1987
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,280
belarusian activist groups that are not

1988
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,199
affiliated with the government

1989
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,360
they are on the right side they're doing

1990
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,280
an important job

1991
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,199
and they're doing it for a good cause

1992
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,840
yet potentially they operate in a gray

1993
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,920
zone and as much as i agree with the

1994
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,440
opinion that we need to get rid of

1995
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,960
ambiguity

1996
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,440
what will happen with such activist

1997
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,520
groups um so

1998
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,880
interesting okay

1999
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,800
is that durian armed conflict you're

2000
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,159
talking about when you say they're on

2001
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,280
the right side are you talking about the

2002
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,800
russia conflict

2003
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,480
russian conflict and let's say in a

2004
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,280
belarusian case the after the elections

2005
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,040
after the elections correct so even

2006
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,280
outside in a specific circumstances

2007
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,960
where people are oppressed and so for

2008
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,800
example cyber partisans in belarus

2009
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,920
leaking

2010
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,159
the documentation of police officers

2011
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,000
that committed the crimes

2012
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,880
correct correct thank you thank you so

2026
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,880
even gave you mints exactly

01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,400
go ahead i wish i had some wine there

2028

2029

01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,960

2031
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,520
so new wine all bottles was um if if i

2032
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,280
are to advise

2033
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,920
if i am to advise

2034
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,760
a commander or

2035
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,840
my government

2036
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,560
regardless of of the technique used

2037
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,120
i still have to answer two questions

2038
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,120
can you launch an operation of this kind

2039
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,880
can you use

2040
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,280
any of your instruments of power state

2041
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,560
instruments of power whether it's

2042
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,199
diplomatic or economic or military can i

2043
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,440
use it for this course

2044
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,920
and how should it be used

2045
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,320
so it boils down very basically to the

2046
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,880
question is there a legal basis for

2047
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
legitimate behavior

2048
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,080
by

2049
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,159
in order to er

2050
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,560
facilitating the application of the

2051
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,080
instruments of force that's question

2052
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,640
number one compare the questions of use

2053
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,480
at balum and then the second question

2054
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,480
for those who are to execute that

2055
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,040
activity how should it be done

2056
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,440
and whether the technique is is old or

2057
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,080
new and and the rules have been

2058
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,560
clarified by by virtue of a manual or

2059
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,600
not

2060
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,360
those questions will still have to be

2061
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,880
answered so

2062
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,679
it's i fully agree with you

2063
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,000
but the problem is the answers will have

2064
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,239
will have to be brought forward anyway

2065
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,400
and it's inevitable to compare the new

2066
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,840
to the old yeah

2067
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,080
sometimes and there's no other times it

2068
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,840
helps and sometimes it's not very useful

2069
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,719
at all

2070
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,920
okay

2071
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,679
uh so i was like i had it written down

2072
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,880
in response to the question about

2073
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,640
non-state actors that one of the things

2074
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,800
that i would like to see in uh

2075
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,159
telemannial uh 3.0 is we've seen in the

2076
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,239
conflict in ukraine both the private

2077
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,440
sector um playing a bigger role and also

2078
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,440
volunteers and i i think that's

2079
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,440
something that would be useful and which

2080
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,760
existing ihl actually provides answers

2081
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,280
for and i will leave

2082
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,199
mike to to speak to that because he's

2083
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,239
the expert um and that really goes to um

2084
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,199
uh juliana's question uh as well

2085
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,719
um on the old bottle new wine um i think

2086
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,640
for me it's a question of the labeling

2087
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,640
on the bottle rather than a new bottle

2088
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,040
or an old one a different bottle and in

2089
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,760
part that goes back to the idea that if

2090
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,560
we moved to something new

2091
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,880
what first of all what's actually wrong

2092
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,800
with what we have in terms of the legal

2093
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,320
system that we have and the fear that

2094
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,239
my real fear having been involved in

2095
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,239
these negotiations is if you throw away

2096
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,000
this bottle you're not going to get

2097
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,520
something better

2098
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,760
and so i actually think whilst this may

2099
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,600
not be perfect

2100
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,840
we have to make sure that we actually

2101
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,400
appreciate what we already have and talk

2102
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,239
about how that applies

2103
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,400
in the circumstance of

2104
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,400
of cyber or different types of

2105
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,159
technology

2106
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,320
and to the point about ambiguity i'm not

2107
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,440
arguing that ambiguity is over i'm

2108
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,880
saying that it very clearly isn't over

2109
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,360
my point is that the argument that

2110
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,199
ambiguity is strategically useful for us

2111
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,960
i think is no longer a concept that

2112
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,280
stands

2113
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,760
very important mike so on the non-state

2114
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,760
actor i mean that actually is my field

2115
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,760
and uh it's weird that you asked that

2116
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,600
question because during this morning's

2117
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,120
presentation on the ukraine which i

2118
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,120
found absolutely fascinating i was

2119
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,199
writing furiously because i said someone

2120
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,560
needs to write an article on that and i

2121
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,880
was making myself an outline of what

2122
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,560
that article might look like he's

2123
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,000
probably actually already written it

2124
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,159
you're so overweight already

2125
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,360
so

2126
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,040
i think the manual handles that pretty

2127
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,719
well at least with regard to the

2128
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,800
conflict however we need to update it

2129
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,679
and

2130
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,600
enhance the uh

2131
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,840
enhance the emphasis there is one and

2132
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,280
it's called direct participation in

2133
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,000
hostilities and so we need to clarify

2134
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,679
that for example someone may directly

2135
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,199
participate in hostilities even though

2136
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:16,960
they're outside the battle space things

2137
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,080
like that we need to clarify for example

2138
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,000
that if someone is

2139
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,520
engaging in cyber operations to prevent

2140
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,520
a violation of international

2141
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,920
humanitarian law that is not direct

2142
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,679
participation in hostilities that would

2143
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,760
then render them targetable which is

2144
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,120
important because the russians have the

2145
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,440
capability to target uh those

2146
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,320
individuals in the uh in ukraine the

2147
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,400
real question is one of of what about

2148
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,239
all those individuals that are outside

2149
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,880
of ukraine and the question isn't their

2150
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,080
status the question is neutrality

2151
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,080
because if it's an international armed

2152
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,159
conflict we know they're belligerents

2153
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,719
one on each side in this case and we

2154
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,679
know that other states are

2155
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,480
probably neutral i've written recently

2156
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,800
questioning the neutral status a little

2157
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,600
bit

2158
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,480
but

2159
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,840
if we call them neutral the question is

2160
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,760
does that neutral state have an

2161
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,719
obligation to put an end to those

2162
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,640
activities because neutral states

2163
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,480
typically must put an end to the

2164
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,000
exercise of belligerent rights in

2165
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,760
neutral territory

2166
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,560
i'm not so sure the answer is yes

2167
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,480
because there is a doctrine called

2168
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,159
qualified

2169
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:32,159
neutrality but it's very controversial

2170
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:35,520
and very good scholars

2171
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,880
have written

2172
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,040
that it's not a good

2173
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,280
doctrine i'm a qualified neutrality

2174
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,120
person which means that i believe that

2175
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,520
states do not have to take action to put

2176
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,920
an end to the i.t army's operations from

2177
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,080
their territory however my colleague at

2178
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,000
the naval war college writing in west

2179
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,239
point's articles of war blog

2180
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,800
spectacular blog in response to me

2181
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
because i wrote about it there

2182
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,360
pete pedrozo pete pedrozo today had a

2183
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,360
very good blog

2184
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,199
saying that that that's a breach of

2185
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,280
neutrality states need to do something

2186
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,600
so in that space we need to be more

2187
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,000
granular the law is law's good but we

2188
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,960
need to be more granular in the uh

2189
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,199
non-armed conflict space i would uh just

2190
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,840
echo exactly what my friend marcos said

2191
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,360
you know international law is a body of

2192
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,840
law that is like it or not like it or

2193
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,000
not it's a body of lot is generally

2194
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,920
designed to

2195
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,840
handle the relations between states and

2196
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,920
we have rules of state responsibility

2197
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,400
that address attribution and you apply

2198
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,000
those rules and we do do a pretty good

2199
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,560
job there the big issue is human rights

2200
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,440
marco comes on now has the the co-editor

2201
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,639
of the project and if you don't know

2202
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,400
mark milanovic he's probably one of the

2203
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,080
top guys in the world if not the top guy

2204
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,199
in the world

2205
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,360
i'm just saying that to be nice uh

2206
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,760
because the audience yeah but this is

2207
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,280
otherwise that's not how he treats but

2208
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,159
in all seriousness we one of the reasons

2209
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,800
why i brought marco on why i asked marco

2210
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,880
to do this is because i felt that our

2211
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,360
chapter on human rights was weak

2212
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,880
it was one of the chapters i was most

2213
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,679
dissatisfied with and working with marco

2214
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,760
and capacity building all i understood

2215
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,080
how weak it is and so that's an area

2216
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,840
where non-state actors are going to have

2217
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,560
but if i may just add uh uh you know on

2218
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,639
on that particular point the

2219
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,320
you are not if you're a cyber partisan

2220
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,440
in belarus and you're fighting against

2221
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,880
the kashankar regime outside armed

2222
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,800
conflict international law doesn't apply

2223
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,000
to you you're not violating

2224
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,480
international law in any way by leaking

2225
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,000
the confidential documents of the

2226
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,159
lukashenko regime about how many

2227
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,040
thousands of people were in the georgina

2228
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,800
prison right you know that there's

2229
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,239
there's no violation international at

2230
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,080
all the issue is if they put you in

2231
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,080
prison for what you've done does that

2232
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,840
violate for example the freedom of

2233
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,239
expression you have under the iccpr and

2234
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,159
the answer is yes normally you know i

2235
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,679
would vary that that would be that's

2236
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,280
what the relevance potential in that

2237
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,800
type of very quickly respond to your

2238
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,159
point because i think you make a really

2239
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,480
good point there are

2240
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,280
i'm hoping that in great part it is an

2241
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,120
exercise in clarifying the law but

2242
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,360
you're absolutely right and you've

2243
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,120
nailed one of the two areas where we

2244
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,679
will certainly add ambiguity and the

2245
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,000
first is sovereignty because we did not

2246
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,239
acknowledge this very strange british

2247
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,000
view but we must because it's our

2248
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,280
commitment

2249
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,920
uh and second the other area is due

2250
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,040
diligence i i i will be frank

2251
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,280
that australia hasn't come on board yet

2252
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,560
uh

2253
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,120
in due diligence i did not expect as

2254
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,560
much pushback

2255
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,600
and it is

2256
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,840
on the notion of due diligence and the

2257
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,360
five i states as well as israel have now

2258
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,600
pushed back on due diligence

2259
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,679
and i did not expect as much confusion

2260
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,320
over the nature of the due diligence

2261
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,639
principle so due diligence which is

2262
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,639
hugely important is going to take is

2263
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,520
going to change quite a bit to add in

2264
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,560
the uncertainty about it and to make it

2265
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,639
more granular for states that

2266
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,239
so are trying to figure it out what

2267
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,719
their national position is now now i'm

2268
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,159
going to make an executive decision we

2269
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,000
have five more minutes we're going to

2270
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,679
steal a couple of more minutes from the

2271
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,600
break if that's okay with you and we're

2272
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,960
going to go to the people who very

2273
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,639
patiently waited

2274
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,040
uh uh to ask questions and we'll again

2275
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,239
i'm going to take a couple of questions

2276
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,199
please

2277
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,800
my name is samantha gunn i'm with the

2278
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,719
united states military academy at west

2279
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:21,760
point and my question to the panel is

2280
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,080
how do you define the sovereignty in a

2281
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,239
cloud computing environment and does the

2282
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,800
locality of the servers and or the

2283
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,040
location of the data on those servers

2284
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,199
matter thank you

2285
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,400
um

2286
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,120
there's one more question there so just

2287
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,040
one question there and then there yeah

2288
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:39,920
thank you

2289
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,800
thank you i i hate to um you all such

2290
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
amazing experts on hate versus consensus

2291
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,639
or group think whatever you want to call

2292
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,960
it um you know i've been composing my

2293
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,719
head a response to professor levicki's

2294
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,800
absurd analogy yesterday

2295
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,000
i i think that um you know there's a i

2296
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,040
want to ask you how you would

2297
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,320
accommodate um in terms of the the

2298
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,000
practical arguments of ambiguity um with

2299
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,440
respect to the comments by finland

2300
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,199
earlier about their motivations for

2301
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,679
ambiguity and secondly

2302
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,280
how you accommodate the emergence of

2303
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,520
doctrine it's great to have techies but

2304
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,679
you have doctrinal expertise

2305
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,800
we no longer have that

2306
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,960
clear line i think arguably speaking for

2307
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,520
myself between intel and cyber i don't

2308
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,000
think there is a conflation of cyber and

2309
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,920
intel when the paradigm that's emerging

2310
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,040
is is information warfare which is cyber

2311
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,600
plus intel plus information operations

2312
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,159
plus ew and for the air force plus

2313
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,679
weather if you think about it you'll

2314
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,880
figure that why so how you kind of

2315
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,639
account for that if it's not just about

2316
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,880
cyber anymore okay thank you and and

2317
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,239
then the final question there please

2318
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,719
since you got such uh short and easy

2319
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,880
questions earlier i'll be very brief uh

2320
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,800
ingrid winter i'm the norwegian special

2321
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,880
envoy at the center here also a

2322
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,360
enthusiast more than a definitely not a

2323
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,280
lawyer to be more precise and forgive me

2324
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,480
a lawyer would probably have asked this

2325
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,679
question better um what's your point on

2326
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,760
um

2327
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,679
other institutions contributing to

2328
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,600
bodies of law and

2329
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,760
u.s prudence and victor jorah's comment

2330
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,679
during the ukraine panel this morning i

2331
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,360
was wondering if anyone on the panel

2332
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,040
wanted to predict how

2333
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,760
and what will likely be

2334
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,040
the first

2335
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,400
case law

2336
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,480
in this field coming out of ukraine in

2337
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,719
the coming years will impact for example

2338
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,560
tallinn 3.0

2339
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,320
very simple straightforward short

2340
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,679
question right

2341
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:36,639
okay

2342
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,880
okay good good good who wants to go

2343
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,040
first i'll i'll do the the

2344
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,760
last the the final question what pops up

2345
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,000
is there is this debate about blocking

2346
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,400
rt and sputnik

2347
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,000
that might very well be the first case

2348
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,920
coming up

2349
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,639
and so that is

2350
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,199
no this will be a quarter general

2351
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,800
instance and uh

2352
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,520
the general court in the ndcg eu

2353
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,360
because it was done in the eu by eu

2354
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,560
directives

2355
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,120
yeah yeah so it's it's not an ihl child

2356
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,719
field but in another one

2357
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,120
that might be the first one i mean it's

2358
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,120
you know these cases take so so so long

2359
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,840
to so

2360
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,360
no way to know you know waiting to know

2361
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,280
what's gonna if it if something comes

2362
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,040
out then we'll take it into account

2363
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,199
that's the best we can do essentially

2364
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,719
it's really hard to predict actually

2365
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,719
what decision will come down when and

2366
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,120
whether it'll have cyber implications uh

2367
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,600
uh joanna

2368
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,760
uh so i'm going to take the the middle

2369
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,320
question um about the ambiguity point um

2370
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,920
i think the point that was being made by

2371
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,920
finland was a different point the the

2372
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,679
ambiguity that she was looking to

2373
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,159
preserve there is the ambiguity of

2374
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,239
articulating when you know someone is on

2375
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,960
your networks or not um and so it's sort

2376
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,800
of the opposite end of the ambiguity so

2377
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,679
what i'm talking about is ambiguity more

2378
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,440
in where our

2379
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,480
our

2380
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,639
red lines are

2381
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,800
and maybe not even where our red lines

2382
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,280
are but where we have sort of a reddish

2383
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,360
pinkish border at the moment we're not

2384
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,960
even being clear about that and so

2385
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,920
uh that that question of whether or not

2386
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,840
we know someone is on our networks i

2387
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,679
absolutely understand why we're not

2388
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,199
going to be explicit about that because

2389
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,120
if we're articulating every time we know

2390
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,040
they're on our networks then

2391
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,639
that allows people to probe and

2392
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,080
understand when they're not on your

2393
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,560
networks and when when our capabilities

2394
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,199
are

2395
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,440
not distinguishing what we do and don't

2396
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,000
know so there's very clear operational

2397
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,560
reasons then to maintain uh the

2398
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,800
ambiguity there

2399
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,880
it's also for me the point you raise

2400
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,800
about doctrine is a really important one

2401
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,320
and it goes back to the question earlier

2402
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
about tech neutrality or not i think

2403
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,400
when you're getting to the doctrinal

2404
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,280
level

2405
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,000
how does a how do you apply this in an

2406
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,400
operational sense it makes sense to get

2407
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,880
into the technology at that level but

2408
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,480
that's not necessarily something that

2409
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,320
needs to happen at the international

2410
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,159
level immediately

2411
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,400
and this is a progressive process that

2412
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,199
will unfold and so i think it's a step

2413
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,320
there

2414
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,080
on that final point of distinguishing

2415
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,639
between uh intelligence operations

2416
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,040
electronic warfare uh operations in

2417
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,600
support of armed conflict etc

2418
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,360
i i think

2419
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,199
the the

2420
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,840
the linking of intelligence operations

2421
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,120
very directly to operations in support

2422
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,800
of armed conflict

2423
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,120
uh is something that we need to really

2424
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,760
think carefully about

2425
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,320
we have in australia the australian

2426
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,239
signals directorate and we have

2427
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,080
information warfare division within the

2428
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,520
australian defense force um they operate

2429
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,679
together sometimes but they also operate

2430
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:57,040
under separate authorities and

2431
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,560
you know there's the old adage the

2432
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,280
difference between cne and cna is uh

2433
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,719
intent and that obviously still holds

2434
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,560
when we're in situations of armed

2435
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,360
conflict i think it's a lot clearer and

2436
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,440
this for me is not saying that we won't

2437
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,400
have strategic we won't have uh absolute

2438
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,120
clarity uh at all times but i think in

2439
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,440
the situation of armed conflict there is

2440
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,159
benefit in being clear about this

2441
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:25,120
thank you mike um

2442
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,520
i'll address the the question on

2443
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,679
litigation i i

2444
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,280
i because i thought about it this

2445
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,520
morning during the ukraine because one

2446
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,040
of the participants i can't remember

2447
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,400
which one was talking about the cases

2448
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,560
that will be brought against

2449
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,719
russia hopefully

2450
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,320
in the icc

2451
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,000
wherever national courts because of

2452
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,520
course there's universal jurisdiction

2453
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,000
over war crimes and so forth so i'm not

2454
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,159
sure i've seen many

2455
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,679
war crimes

2456
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,239
committed by russia now is russia

2457
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,080
targeting civilian infrastructure you

2458
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:56,880
bet

2459
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,000
is there a rule of international

2460
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,080
humanitarian law and international

2461
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,760
criminal law that you may not attack

2462
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,480
civilian objects of course there is

2463
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,560
so attacking a civilian object is a war

2464
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,400
crime but

2465
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,360
the issue of what is an attack in the

2466
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,199
cyber context which we struggled with

2467
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,080
in the manual has yet to be settled and

2468
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,320
very few states have spoken to this

2469
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,360
issue israel being a notable exception

2470
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,239
uh france being a notable exception

2471
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,320
so if i i used to be a prosecutor if i

2472
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,040
was going to prosecute someone for the

2473
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,480
war crime

2474
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,560
of attacking civilian objects looking at

2475
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,960
the russian operations i'm going to

2476
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,360
struggle so you're talking about cyber

2477
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,120
you're not talking about psychology yeah

2478
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,880
oh my god no i mean

2479
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,360
listen it's a textbook case of every war

2480
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,760
crime uh i work with the team after i

2481
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,600
wanted to make this game he's not an

2482
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,520
apologist for us no no no that's all i

2483
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,000
just wanted to do we uh you forgot the

2484
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,639
words another reason why you're required

2485
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,920
yes only cyber i mean we're i work with

2486
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,600
the folks at west point

2487
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,080
uh and we're having a hard time

2488
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,800
literally keeping up uh with the number

2489
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,159
of war crimes being committed by the

2490
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,159
russians it's really quite extraordinary

2491
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,639
and horrific but in the cyber context

2492
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,560
i'm going to struggle the other

2493
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,360
problem is that

2494
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,840
the the offenses attacking a civilian

2495
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,199
object the russians are engaging against

2496
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,159
data

2497
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,719
the question is is data has a matter of

2498
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,400
law and object and there's another

2499
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,320
question that has been yet to be

2500
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,400
resolved um

2501
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,800
and and i don't see any resolution on

2502
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,480
the horizon so i think that's pretty

2503
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,960
unlikely just because of making the

2504
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,560
offense out uh to the to the folks at

2505
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,960
west point well since i'm affiliated

2506
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,400
with west point what a great question

2507
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,679
although

2508
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,360
since i'm also affiliated with the

2509
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,760
united states naval war college where

2510
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,639
i'm a professor emeritus i have to admit

2511
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,520
to to to the naval academy folks that

2512
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,040
the reason they asked such a good

2513
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,360
question was because after the last

2514
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,199
session i went to them and said are you

2515
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,199
kidding me you're going to let the naval

2516
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,199
academy ask a good question and you're

2517
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,760
not going to respond in kind so that's

2518
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,280
the genesis of this superb quest

2519
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,600
so it's really um it's really a a very

2520
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,520
it is a wonderful question i'm not so

2521
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,000
sure i have the answer for you so i

2522
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,880
think i know how to explain the law of

2523
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,159
sovereignty

2524
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,480
um

2525
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,719
if it if it if a cyber operation

2526
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,320
generates particular effects on the

2527
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,400
territory of another country then that's

2528
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,000
a breach of sovereignty now we haven't

2529
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,320
got consensus on what the threshold of

2530
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,080
effects is

2531
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,719
and we're looking for that now but i can

2532
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,040
tell you that's the rule and i can also

2533
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,880
tell you that if a cyber operation

2534
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,719
interferes with inherently governmental

2535
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,120
function of another country like holding

2536
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,719
elections as an example law enforcement

2537
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,840
has another example that's a violation

2538
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,719
but of course cloud computing

2539
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,400
complicates this and so what i would say

2540
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,480
is since we

2541
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,440
are struggling to find acceptance

2542
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,440
acceptance of the legal rules of the

2543
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,320
game with regard to sovereignty already

2544
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,600
trying to

2545
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,239
figure out cloud computing don't hold

2546
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:23,360
your breath

2547
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,760
don't hold your breath i don't think

2548
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,440
the one thing that can certainly be said

2549
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,040
is that location of the infrastructure

2550
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,560
doesn't matter

2551
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,480
if you are in estonia and you know

2552
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,080
there's cloud computing infrastructure

2553
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,120
on your territory you have the right to

2554
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,800
regulate whatever you want out of that

2555
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:37,840
right

2556
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,600
i mean so it's it's the rule of

2557
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,280
jurisdiction international law rule or

2558
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,520
jurisdiction but

2559
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,600
we we actually thought of that question

2560
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,080
and just left it alone if you the manual

2561
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,239
has a throwaway sentence it says god

2562
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,199
it's translated into texan it's golly i

2563
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,199
i really can't figure this one out okay

2564
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,080
in texan we are five minutes uh behind

2565
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,040
schedule thank you so much for attending

2566
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,880
this panel on the talent manual we hope

2567
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,880
you liked it and that we have your

2568
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,580
thoughts and prayers with us indeed

2569
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:12,068
[Applause]
