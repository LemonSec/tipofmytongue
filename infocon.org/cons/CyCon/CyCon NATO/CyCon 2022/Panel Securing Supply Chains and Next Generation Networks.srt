good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,560
welcome to the session about supply

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
chain and 5g security and as i see the

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,559
clock is ticking and we have just 25

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,160
minutes

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,000
as we have to leave the room before the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
next session starts

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,359
i would like to kick it off right away

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279

and uh he's a

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
nato cio and

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
cso and

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
he has this unique uh

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,440
expertise that kim talked about as he

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160
nicely bridges the cap of

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
it leadership

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,640
of

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
25 years

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
experience from both startups and

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
multinational corporations including

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,480
in europe

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,119
united states canada and brazil

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,680
and nicely has worked also as a

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
programmer and

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,760
in a company providing wireless iot and

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,759
5g solutions

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
and on top of that he holds two master's

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
degrees and he's currently

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,640
a doctorate candidate and research

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,439
associate at the university of reading

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
examining human machine interactions

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
within the context of iot

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,720
so without further ado ado let's start

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
first from supply chain and then

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
we moved to 5g

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
so why is it important let me

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
start with couple of statements

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,920
many speakers today and yesterday

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
mentioned supply chain

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
security and vulnerabilities

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
and

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,960
clearly not only ransomware and 5g but

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,759
also supply chain has become a national

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,880
security concern and this is

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
illustrated by the

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,639
high-profile supply chain attacks and

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,400
public attribution uh by the eu

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
ukraine uh five eyes and others

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
among

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,360
among others not petya solarwinds and

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
most recently you know crane the

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,319
car set attack which by the way was also

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
a supply chain as the initial uh

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,800
intrusion happened through ground based

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
network which was

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
operated by a subsidiary of uh

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
auto sets which

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
already notoriously got some reputation

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
this morning and

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
at least one wiper

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
was also delivered by a third-party

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,440
software supplier

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
so

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
also as for the background then

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,040
uh eu and u.s trade and technology

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
accounts still as well as squad

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
corporation have

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
promised to align their security

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
standards of software supply chain for

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,959
government

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,720
purchases

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
so it's uh

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
seeing those um

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
actions at the

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
international level so just to throw in

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
some data points uh this is not

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
surprising because um according to

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,239
industry

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
reports the supply chain attacks have

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
increased 300 percent uh last year over

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
2020 and

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,680
very some recent report

86
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
62 percent of intrusions

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
last year uh took place through

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,599
chain moreover uh pereniza's recent

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
report more than 50 percent

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
of uh attacks are um conducted by 80

91
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,120
apts

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
and of course it's not surprising

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,879
because as um

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
organizations get better and better in

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
harnessing their networks then

96
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
supply chain attack vector offers very

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
good

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
so to speak door

99
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,399
because

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,199
it's stealthy scalable and offers

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
privileged access both to on-premise and

102
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,840
cloud environments and hybrid

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,639
environments so um we see that those

104
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,440
attacks are often targeted and costly

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
and complex and usually uh take quite a

106
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
long time for planning for example

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
solarwinds attacks according to reports

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
took at least six months for preparation

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
until the malware was deployed

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
uh on the other hand uh we heard about

111
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,199
zero trust policy

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,400
s

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
bombs

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
but those as well don't mitigate all the

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,320
supply chain risk and an example is a

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
lock for j or law for shell

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
which

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
i have heard uh s-bomb would not uh help

119
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,199
to mitigate and many organizations have

120
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
still difficulty to actually identifying

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
those software dependencies on open

122
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,440
source

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
so uh with that little background my

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,039
first question one friend to you is um

125
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,400
as you are overseeing 41 sites

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
in nato

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,680
and in nato enterprise and 25 000 people

128
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
so what is your role and your office

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
role which i understand is pretty new

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
established in september last year

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
in securing supply chain and in

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,680
particular

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,039
as we know that anissa has published

134
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,919
threat threat assessment and guidelines

135
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
there on east islands and many

136
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
governments have similar so what is nato

137
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,240
doing do you have uh

138
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
your own kind of certification or or

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,000
standardization and and or policy and

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
and uh how do you uh approach this

141
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,720
well

142
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
period thank you so much for the very

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
warm introduction good afternoon

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
everyone i think there are five

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
questions in that question so let me

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
just kind of unpack it a little bit so

147
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
as pirate mentioned i started at nato

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
last year in september

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
um before that i was in the private

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
industry worked for canadian

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
telecommunications

152
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
company 5g iot

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,919
pioneer for 11 years before that hp and

154
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
compact so lots of private industry

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
experience

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
um

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
the um the question on okay so what is

158
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,280
it that the the cio does at nato so

159
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,000
there's there's two legs to my job

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,919
and one leg is looking after enterprise

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
coherence

162
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
and the enterprise as you mentioned it's

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
it's 41 more or less entities that's

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
kind of the inner part of of nato which

165
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,759
is the by strategic commands

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,639
allied command operations li command

167
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
transformation the different agencies

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
that we have parts of the the nato

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,199
headquarters

170
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,440
so it is basically everything

171
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
that is nato that's not the alliance or

172
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
the federation which would be our member

173
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
nations and and and the partners and so

174
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
that's about uh total count of 25 000

175
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
users 4141 entities

176
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,639
and so one thing that we do is looking

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,759
after

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
i.t coherence

179
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
that we

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
approach portfolio management

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
architectural decisions service level

182
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
considerations

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
in a harmonized way across the 40 plus

184
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
entities of nato and then the other part

185
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
is to be the single point of authority

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
for cyber security for the nato

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
enterprise and the enterprise risk owner

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
and so with that let me get to the

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
question of you know kind of from a

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,759
policy perspective so there is a so so

191
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
the policies at nato are really set by

192
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
the nations right

193
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
and there are two there are a number of

194
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,400
committees um that are operating

195
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
underneath the neck the north atlantic

196
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
council which is the top-level

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
governance body of course of nato

198
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
and the committees that are most active

199
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
in this space is the c3 board

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
the consultation

201
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,440
um uh

202
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,599
command and control board that's

203
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
essentially a collection of i.t

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,519
professionals

205
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
and then it is the cyber defense

206
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,839
committee that's also very very active

207
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,720
in that space right and so policy

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
governance is being set at the board

209
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,800
level

210
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
and what we're looking for is

211
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
implementing those

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
policy or government decisions to the

213
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
best of the nato enterprise we're kind

214
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
of the guardians of the cohesiveness

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
from an i.t perspective in in the

216
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
enterprise as well as making sure

217
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,160
that the nato enterprise is as secure as

218
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
it uh can possibly be

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
could that answer

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
yes yes um i i trust of course that

221
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,959
there are issues that

222
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,200
you cannot touch here in this format but

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,959
i would assume that

224
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,800
things we heard

225
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
during the industry presentations such

226
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
as

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
various equipment for uh improving uh

228
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,360
network detection such as also regarding

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,839
the supply chain are used as well as uh

230
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,959
threat intelligence sharing and so on

231
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
but let me as you mentioned nato as an

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
alliance uh let me

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,640
ask

234
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
about the nations

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,160
so um what is do you have this bird eye

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
view over 30 nations and the national

237
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
level because my understanding is that

238
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
during nato operations also national cis

239
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
is connected to to nato nato enterprise

240
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
nato network so

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
basically the threats would mitigate

242
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
from one or uh transfer from one the the

243
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,839
other so is there a common view in nato

244
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,959
about

245
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,000
common approach to supply chain uh

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,279
security and policies and and standards

247
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
and uh

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
i'm here thinking about

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
various measures that

250
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,279
for example the nisa has proposed or or

251
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
some governments like u.s government for

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
example nationally such as various uh

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
more technical measures

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
certification

255
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
auditing

256
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,120
testing verification etc

257
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,839
is there a common approach or each

258
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
nation and of course if we talk about

259
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,800
that then there is a concern about

260
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,160
discrepancies and some nations are

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
lagging behind and which will have

262
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,640
implications to interoperability because

263
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,839
we would like to see the common baseline

264
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,600
security level

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
for example a couple of years ago nato

266
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
announced that they have agreed

267
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
we have agreed to baseline security uh

268
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
requirements for telecommunications so

269
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,600
we are now already um shifting to 5gs

270
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
soon but

271
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,079
regarding this aspect do you see there

272
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
is more need to

273
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
to harmonize those or are we content

274
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
where where we are at the national level

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
okay so

276
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,639
again about

277
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,880
five questions and the one question so

278
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,040
the answer is yes and yes so um

279
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
so are we um

280
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,360
are we at a place where we do have

281
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
standards and interoperability and and

282
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
those considerations the answer is yes

283
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
but there is always a pathway to do more

284
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
right so let me uh let me touch

285
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,320
a couple of a

286
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
couple of tenets here that that are in

287
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
your question so one is

288
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
interoperability which is which is

289
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
hugely important for nato obviously

290
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
right you can only

291
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
um

292
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
pull um

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
the string into the same direction if

294
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
you if you work on the same standards

295
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
right and that is true across the

296
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,959
alliance as well as partners right

297
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
so the way how we exchange information

298
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
and

299
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
and work on common common systems needs

300
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
to be needs to be harmonized and there's

301
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,920
a couple of uh

302
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,120
um areas that play in this field one is

303
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
the uh nato office of standardization

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
that sets the stagnacs and that that the

305
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
nation subscribe to and

306
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
and are are working with

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
uh then there is uh

308
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
there is also uh specifically on the

309
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
cyber security side there's a lot of

310
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
interaction that takes place we learn a

311
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,079
lot from each other which which should

312
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,079
not be surprising right because there's

313
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839
a lot of knowledge

314
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
that are

315
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
um with the allies and also within the

316
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
within the nato enterprise a lot of a

317
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,079
lot of exchange of information that's

318
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
happening there

319
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
through a couple of different

320
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,959
a couple of different forums

321
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,079
and

322
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,000
so yeah it's uh

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,079
you know and there's always an ongoing

324
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,560
conversation about how can we make this

325
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,440
better

326
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
so there's never

327
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
i think a situation of complete

328
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
complete interoperability complete

329
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
exchange of information right it's it's

330
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
always going to be

331
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,680
an evolving field particularly since

332
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
also

333
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,800
very soon i would expect for us to have

334
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
two new allies right and that needs to

335
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
be brought needs to be brought up to to

336
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
that level again so it's a it's a work

337
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
in progress

338
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,399
thank you

339
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,199
now shifting cares to 5g which i

340
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,079
understand is also your area expertise

341
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
so we heard in the last session about

342
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,720
new risks from virtualization

343
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
uh softwareization etc which kim

344

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
described nicely including software

346
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
supply chain issues because these are

347
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
implicated also in 5g

348
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,600
but

349
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,040
it was also talked about how many

350
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
security enhancements 5gs offers

351
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
compared to the previous generations but

352
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,839
one of the reasons that military

353
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,600
will benefit

354
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,839
of course is because it enables to

355
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
connect sensors to decision making

356
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
makers and enables enhances situational

357
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
awareness and and speeds the decision

358
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,120
making

359
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
so

360
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,600
as well as various military applications

361
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
such as ar vr

362
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
iot

363
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
also smart logistics smart

364
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
warehouses and i know

365
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
nato nca is leading a multinational 5g

366
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,440
collaboration project and various

367
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
nations are experimenting and

368
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
prototyping with those 5g use cases and

369
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
just recently uh read the news that the

370
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,880
lock

371
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
head martin and microsoft

372
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
had experiment where they

373
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,160
uh linked

374
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,440
link 16 to microsoft cloud so that was

375
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
uh interesting

376
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,759
and

377
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
we in our center we also run a couple of

378
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,079
workshops on 5g military security and

379
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,320
one of the ideas that was floating

380
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
around there was that nato should start

381
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,800
thinking about

382
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,720
5g strategy because you already have a

383
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,800
data policy ai strategy and so on and we

384
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
do need

385
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,360
to

386
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,000
have some kind of principles in terms of

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
reliability and security but also in

388
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
terms of where are the directions what

389
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
are those use cases so what is your take

390
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,279
on this that

391
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,000
are are there specific use cases that

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,079
the nation should develop and

393
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
because let's be honest uh building

394
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,199
private 5g networks it's very um

395
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,120
resource

396
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,759
expensive expensive yes

397
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,360
thank you so

398
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
uh so could you a little bit elaborate

399
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
on that that what is your view uh do do

400
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
nations need some kind of joint

401
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
uh vision uh plan in terms of um using

402
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,199
the benefits of 5g yeah so i think

403
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,279
there's a lot of obviously 5g

404
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,359
initiatives that are ongoing

405
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,400
um with the allies it was just last week

406
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,359
that we had the c3 board that i referred

407
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,079
to

408
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
earlier the plenary

409
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
with

410
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,439
an excellent presentation from one

411
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
nation about their activities in that

412
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,520
field and i think what you will find is

413
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
that among 30 nations there there are

414
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760
some that are more

415
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
more active in the 5g space and others

416
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,000
are

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
maybe a bit less active we're still

418
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
watching as to what's going on there so

419
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
i think there's a lot of um

420
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
communication and and again learning

421
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
from each other as to where different

422
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
nations stand

423
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
and then the other part of your question

424
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
i think is is towards nato itself right

425
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
because as as a nato enterprise we can

426
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,600
benefit hugely from 5g

427
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
and we have

428
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
and there's also two parts to it i think

429
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
one is kind of standards and a strategy

430
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,799
and i think we're on the way

431
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
to getting there there is a 5g

432
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
conversation that's ongoing internal to

433
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,480
the nato enterprise as to what do we

434
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
want to do what kind of use cases do we

435
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
want to test

436
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,799
the type of use case itself is um

437
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
probably not even that important as long

438
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
as it's an end-to-end use case right

439
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
that really looks at the technical

440
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,799
aspects

441
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,760
of a 5g solution really from the network

442
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
into the application

443
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
but also looks at open architecture

444
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,399
looks at security looks at

445
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
what can we learn from it from an

446
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
end-to-end perspective right

447
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
and um

448
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,039
and so yeah so so 5g we're still early

449
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
in in the game you know lots of good

450
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,240
conversations lots of uh

451
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,200
uh exchange of uh you know what

452
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
different allies are doing in the 5g

453
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
space and i think as a nato enterprise

454
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,760
we're also going to be a player

455
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
in that field and it's going to come

456
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
over time

457
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
yes so um we we still have almost six

458
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,600
minutes left so we do want to take

459
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,799
audience questions but before doing that

460
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
please prepare

461
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
i wanted to come back to those

462
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,640
military applications and

463
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
one of the recommendations of our own

464
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
report was that

465
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,400
because

466
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
free

467
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,960
gpp standards don't include

468
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
some of those are voluntary

469
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,039
to implement for

470
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,400
mnos and they don't include uh

471
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
maybe sufficient security controls for

472
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
the military so is your view that

473
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,039
and also kim mentioned that everything

474
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
should be secured by design and with 5g

475
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
we have this opportunity now so how can

476
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
nato and military actually make sure

477
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
that those

478
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
military grades security requirements

479
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,799
are considered by commercial providers

480
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
who are sitting in those standardization

481
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
organizations and uh that's a great

482
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
question and we only have four

483
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
businesses left we probably need 40

484
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
minutes for that so how could nato

485
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,520
ensure that that the standards are a

486
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
that they reflect really what the

487
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
sensitivity of the information requires

488
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
right and then that the standards are

489
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
tier two and then also i think more

490
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
importantly that the solution that's

491
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
being provided adheres to the so i think

492
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
there's really three things in there so

493
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400
one is um we are we're not a um

494
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
we don't make laws nato does not make

495
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
laws right we're different from the

496
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,840
european union in that we're not a a

497
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,320
legislative body obviously right so

498
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
we're working with

499
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
other organizations on on

500
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
furthering the discussion about about 5g

501
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,840
the second thing is

502
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,919
transparency with suppliers who would be

503
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,799
building solutions that we start early

504
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,440
on secure by design but that we have

505
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
decision makers

506
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
early at the table to look at how would

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
the standards apply to the solutions

508
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
that are being built

509
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
and then you mentioned you mentioned

510
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
kim's presentation earlier which was

511
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,919
fascinating in terms of

512
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
how do you actually test and how do you

513
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
validate that the solution that's

514
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
provided

515
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,080
adheres to the standard and i think that

516
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,520
is uh

517
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
that's a conversation where i don't have

518
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
an easy answer i think there is a

519
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
an analysis that needs to be done as far

520
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,880
as how we

521
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,520
accredit systems right now it's a pretty

522
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
serial process in terms of a solution is

523
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,960
being built and at the end there is a

524
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
security review of the solution and i

525
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
think this needs to change

526
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
particularly as we get into those agile

527
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
development cycles right where things

528
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,960
kind of go faster and faster and i think

529
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,919
the

530
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,799
the

531
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
validation of the standard and the

532
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
accreditation of a system

533
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
needs to also follow

534
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
um in an agile fashion

535
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,159
um kind of like one building block with

536
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,600
the next building block so i almost see

537
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
it like a as a as a tile

538
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,559
um arrangement rather than one block you

539
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,880
know a supplier builds the solution and

540
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,679
then we kind of test it and accredit it

541
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
afterwards

542
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
thank you unfortunately we are running

543
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,200
out of time and i still want you to ask

544
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
about diana and how

545
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
we can leverage this for the 5g

546
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,559
experimentation but i want to give the

547
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,960
chance to audience if you have any

548
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
questions then

549
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,559
we can answer them

550
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,320
there is one please

551
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
gentlemen

552
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,039
thank you michael bechtra macerique

553
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
university in brno and accenture

554
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
security europe

555
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
so yesterday's topic was especially for

556
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,919
keynotes was really about the importance

557
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
of cooperation and the public about

558
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,000
private partnerships

559
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,480
and so i wanted to ask you considering

560
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
your extensive private sector experience

561
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
what are the the major challenges that

562
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
we still need to overcome and what what

563
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,240
are the things that we need to improve

564
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
for us to be able to really cooperate

565
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,200
between the nato or the public sector in

566
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
general and the private sector thank you

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
let me see if i can answer that in 90

568
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
seconds and it ties into your diana

569
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
question right because that that really

570
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,880
is a public private academia what we

571
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,799
call the triple helix of

572
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
of innovation so how can we best make

573
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
this work and i think we can best make

574
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
it work through

575
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
ongoing communication right and

576
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
exchanging as to what is important for

577
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,799
each party

578
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
as coming in from the private industry

579
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
into nato i see

580
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
that the governance structure is very

581
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
different from the private sector i see

582
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
that the speed to delivery

583
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,600
is quite different from the private

584
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
sector as well

585
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
and so it's it's basically an exchange

586
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,919
of of information in an ongoing dialogue

587
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,120
as to as to how this partnership works

588
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,279
and also what is the reason why things

589
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,679
at nato take long i mean we we have 30

590
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,720
member nations right that we um

591
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
that we

592
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
that we serve

593
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
and we are a consensus-based

594
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
organization so that means that really

595
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
we agree and to reach agreement and to

596
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,159
have the consultation process in place

597
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
is is a lengthy process and so that's

598
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,279
that's sometimes maybe not

599
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
fully understood by the private industry

600
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,480
and i think that's where a lot of

601
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,960
information exchange and uh

602
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,919
um fits in

603
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,799
yes so i think jana question will be

604
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,200
there for coffee break

605
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
yes see me in the coffee break so what

606
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
we have time for so uh big applause to a

607
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
very interesting discussion

608
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,120
thank you thank you so much thank you
