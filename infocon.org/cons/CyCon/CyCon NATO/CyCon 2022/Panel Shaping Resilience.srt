those that haven't found a seat yet i

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,080
hope there are there are some empty

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,760
chairs right up front so uh don't be shy

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,040
and

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
and let's get the

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,160
first

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,560
afternoon session first breakout session

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
of the of

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
the first day of cycling uh rolling so

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,760
uh

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
i hope you had some uh some fresh uh

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,000
insights in the

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
from the keynotes in the morning i know

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
i certainly did and that you enjoyed

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
what for me remains one of the

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
one of those sort of extra features that

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,320
you never count for when you look at the

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
second agenda but you realize on spot

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,360
that

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
there's good food there's great company

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
over lunch so uh so the conversations

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
that cyclone has been known for are are

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
back and uh

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,480

staff member so

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
i'm a senior cybersecurity expert at the

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,799
e-governance academy located

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,760
in the sort of quarter next two

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
but uh for the past uh 14 years i i

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
served as a as a cyber security law and

37

participated in many of our both

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
research in papers and and exercise

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
activities which you will be also

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
hearing about

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,680
and

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
mr john solomon representing

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
fc isak the financial services

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
information sharing and analysis center

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,480
and his weight of experience

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,959
in tech risk management and leadership

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
for

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,340
over the past two dozen years

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,440
[Laughter]

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
i it felt good to uh to phrase it this

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
way because i can only post with a dozen

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
and plus

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
so um

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
on the topic i think my own research on

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
on national cyber security strategy and

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,519
governance which was sort of my my

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
research area at the ccdc and having had

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
the privilege of also working with uh

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
with estonian government in uh in cyber

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
security strategy development and and

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
advising a few

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
a few other countries around the globe

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
the the trend is pretty evident we used

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,760
to talk about

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,680
cyber security

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,599
a few years back now the language has

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,159
shifted to

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
building resilience or cyber resilience

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
and i would argue for my part that the

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
the language shift also reflects

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
some kind of a mindset the mindset shift

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
which can be viewed negatively as as if

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
as in

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,080
technology is broken and there's no

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
chance of fixing it so we're working or

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
we're thinking about

104
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,040
like how to how to cope and survive or

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,159
it can be viewed and framed positively

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,799
involving the various ways for uh

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,480
future proofing

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
against unpredict predictability while

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
still accepting that

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,120
a level of residual risk

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
so uh but but in this session we will uh

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
take the notion of cyber resilience

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
apart both conceptually and practically

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
we will first have a critical look uh by

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
lee

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
what the concept of cyber resilience

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
means and that if there really is a

118
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
difference

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,720
with the cyber security after all

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
and then we will have uh

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
two look at two ways of building

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
resilience

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
through exercises

124
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
and through public private partnerships

125
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,520
and all three presentations are

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
also included or they are based on

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
articles that

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
are included in cycle proceedings so uh

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
very conveniently the first three

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,800
articles of the of the book so do feel

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
uh

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,759
encouraged and then welcome to read up

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
after after the session as well

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
so a quick house

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
rules before we move to the subject

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
so each speaker will present their their

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
paper their findings and then

138
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
we might follow up with a with a

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
quick question or two but then we will

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
reserve some time for a for q and a

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
towards the end of the session

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
so please mark down your questions and

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
don't let these three gentlemen simply

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
like easily get off the hook and walk

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
out of room after after presentation so

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
do take advantage of this time

147
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
so uh

148
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
and we will start with the professor lee

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
bygrave

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
on the topic of cyber resilience versus

151
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
cyber security as a as a legal

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
aspiration

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
good thanks very much uh cadre a

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,479
wonderful be to be here uh to save my

155
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,680
bum and my back i'm going to stand

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
and uh

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
i was very impressed with the uh the

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
gentleman uh also a professor uh in the

159
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
main session this morning who got

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
everyone else to stand up uh about

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,360
halfway through his presentation i'm not

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
going to encourage you to do that now i

163
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
don't think you deserve it yet but maybe

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
we can do that a little bit later

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,039
uh it certainly did me good so to cut to

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
the chase uh i'm going to as cadre said

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
look at the interrelationship of

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,759
cyber resilience with cyber security

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
both operationally and more particularly

170
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
as public policy ideals and also to some

171
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
extent as legal requirements

172
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,919
and

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
as cadre was intimating cyber resilience

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,039
has become in a way the new pretender to

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,960
the throne of

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,199
steering ideal for a lot of information

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
systems development and i want to

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
question whether

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
its

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
claim to the throne as it were is in

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
fact justified

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
because those who are pushing its claim

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
to the throne would say it is justified

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,520
because it offers a much more realistic

185
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
a much more flexible and nimble

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
approach to

187
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
securing

188
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,120
ideals and values that are attached to

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
information systems architecture

190
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,240
particularly in a fast-moving and fast

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
changing threat environment

192
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
reference the the overarching theme for

193
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,319
cycon 2022

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
and

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
i i want to push back against that

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
narrative and and in chapter two of that

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
very handsome and not too heavy book

198
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,000
that uh you've all received in your

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
goody bags

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
i have delineated my pushback in a lot

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,360
more detail than i can do uh

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
do to do now

203
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,080
so um

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
resilience is nothing new i mean it's

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
it's it's a concept that has been around

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
for at least 50 years

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
and many people would point to an

208
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
article by the canadian ecologist

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
crawford holling

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
uh in the um

211
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,280
uh annual review of ecology and

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
systematics uh volume four

213
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
way back in 1973 as one of the seminal

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
articles on points and while his article

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
was dealing with

216
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
the way in which one conceptualizes

217
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,039
uh

218
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
ecological systems ecosystems

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
uh what's happened in the

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
subsequent years is that

221
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
uh cyber security or so sorry resilience

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,160
has become this very very popular term

223
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,240
and it is um

224
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,399
as i've quoted here from an article by

225
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
cecilia aradau it's become a

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
quasi-universal

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
answer to problems of security and

228
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,200
governance across many many

229
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
different sectors

230
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
and we see it also gaining prominence in

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
discourse concerned with

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
particularly the cyber dimensions of

233
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
critical infrastructure

234
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
and

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
it's become now a very prominent

236
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,200
regulatory ideal particularly with eu

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
legislative initiatives and

238
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
some are for example the proposal for

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
the new nis directive nis2 directive

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
that was recently agreed

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
by the eu institutions and that will

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
take over from the current nis directive

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
we see it also in the proposal for

244
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
regulation on

245
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,279
digital operational resilience for the

246
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,800
financial sector

247
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,760
and

248
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
yet another example a proposal for a new

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
directive on the resilience of critical

250
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,760
entities so these are just three

251
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,720
examples from a whole panoply of uh

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
examples from at least the eu system

253
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
where resilience is certainly a very

254
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
very prominent ideal and to some extent

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,600
pushing out or pushing um

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,399
cyber security into the shadows

257
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
uh although as i'm going to come back to

258
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
the the way in which this is happening

259
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
is somewhat

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
muddled

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,120
and confusing and therefore problematic

262
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
now

263
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
a lot of policy entrepreneurs would say

264
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,000
that this

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,279
this

266
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
rise to prominence of resilience and

267
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
more particularly cyber resilience is

268
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
long overdue

269
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
that

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,120
the quest for cyber security as opposed

271
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
to resilience has taken insufficient

272
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
account of the fact that

273
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,800
insecurity is a basic

274
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
inescapable condition of the digital

275
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
world and that cyber security efforts

276
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
are inevitably pan-glossian

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
and that

278
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
resilience is as i said earlier on a

279
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,959
much more realistic and more pragmatic

280
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,839
way

281
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,760
of uh approaching the problems at hand

282
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
and um

283
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
there's a quote uh on the slide behind

284
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
me from an excellent article by

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
ray rothrock to that effect

286
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
whereas resilience he says engages their

287
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,959
reality

288
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
uh in other words bad things happen

289
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,839
security hinges on the hope

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
which he's basically implying is is a

291
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
rather futile hope a hope of invading or

292
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
postponing that reality

293
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
and some have gone so far

294
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
to to say we should forget totally about

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
cyber security and recalibrate all of

296
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
our discussions now around the

297
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,800
resilience concept

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
um

299
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
and here's uh

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
another example

301
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
taken from some swedish researchers

302
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
whose work i'll come back to in a little

303
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
bit more detail shortly who are writing

304
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
the concept of resilience essentially

305
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240
treats

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
um

307
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,399
adverse cyber events as part of normal

308
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
operations the difference to the concept

309
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
of security can therefore be crucial it

310
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
allows organizations to incorporate

311
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
countermeasures and contingency plans as

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
a part of the new normal

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
condition

314
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
and it's interesting uh as i write in

315
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
the in the book chapter um

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
it's interesting to see that this

317
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
resonates also with crawford hollings

318
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
work from

319
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
ecology uh over 50 years ago because he

320
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,120
was also saying that a resilience

321
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
based model for the ecosystem was a much

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
more realistic way

323
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,320
of of

324
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
dealing with

325
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
adverse uh advance and accommodating for

326
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
future events

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
um and one of the uh in a sense

328
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,600
nice uh rhetorical flushes in the

329
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
article by uh frederick burke and his

330
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
colleagues is to say that

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
um whereas cyber security has been

332
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
overly focused on fail safe measures

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
which they're saying are basically

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,079
unrealistic

335
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,480
and very difficult to achieve as a

336
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
resilience approach goes more over to a

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
safe to fail approach so in other words

338
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
we assume there will be failure and then

339
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
we deal with that failure in the best

340
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,160
manner possible

341
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,279
um

342
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,399
and

343
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
back to ray rothrock

344
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
who basically says

345
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
cyber security is in effect the digital

346
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,079
equivalent of the martian no line

347
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
and at the risk of spelling out the

348
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
obvious the margin no line was that

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,680
set of fortifications that the french

350
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,160
built shortly after world war one along

351
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
their eastern border in order to thwart

352
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
future german aggression and uh the

353
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
fortifications as we remember hopefully

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
uh were

355
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,800
rapidly bypassed by hitler's forces

356
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
during the blitzkrieg of the early 19 of

357
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
early 1940s so the marginal line has

358
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
become more or less a metaphor for uh

359
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
futile security

360
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,839
um

361
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,399
now

362
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,199
to

363
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,199
unpacking this resilience concept

364
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,399
one of the difficulties is that it is

365
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,839
a concept with very very slippery

366
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,399
semantics in that respect it is somewhat

367
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,040
like a chameleon it's very difficult to

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
sort of

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
capture uh it blends in very well in a

370
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,839
variety of discourses and that i think

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
is one reason why it has become such a

372
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
uh

373
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,040
sort of a

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
a colonizing concept over the last 40 or

375
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,320
50 years

376
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
um

377
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
some researchers have also called it a

378
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
or liken it to a rather mysterious and

379
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,760
enigmatic modern super heroine uh and

380
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,839
the the quote uh here um is um

381
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
from uh a lovely piece by miriam don

382
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
cavilty and some of her colleagues uh in

383
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
the sense that you know resilience is

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
mysterious she can be in many places at

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
the same time take on various forms etc

386
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
etc etc

387
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,199
now

388
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,079
one

389
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,519
thing that

390
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
augments these slippery semantics and

391
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,279
somewhat chameleon-like characteristics

392
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,920
of resilience is that a lot of policy

393
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,040
documents

394
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,839
that flag resilience as an ideal

395
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
don't define it

396
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
they mention it and then they move on

397
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
and they almost take it for granted that

398
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,160
there is a settled meaning there is not

399
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,480
a settled meaning resilience comes in

400
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
different forms it's pitched at

401
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
different levels of ambition

402
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
and in any discourse around it we have

403
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
to be very careful that we don't

404
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
engage in sort of you know ships passing

405
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,560
by each other in the night where

406
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
one vision of resilience is being laid

407
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
out but it's not really speaking to

408
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
another person's vision of resilience

409
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,240
the eu in this respect is

410
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
is a real sinner

411
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,120
the european commission has in multiple

412
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
cyber security strategies for the

413
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
european union mentioned resilience but

414
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
never really defined it

415
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,519
and

416
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
nato policy documents

417
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
are guilty to some extent of the same

418
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
thing although there are

419
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
some

420
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,079
attempts to

421
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,279
to

422
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
pitch the notion as essentially a

423
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
capacity to resist

424
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,720
and a reduction of vulnerability

425
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,959
um

426
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,040
and if we go to uh

427
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
legal instruments

428
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
at least then within the eu legislative

429
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,320
framework we find a rather confusing and

430
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
muddled

431
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
picture of how resilience maps

432
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,279
onto

433
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,399
security

434
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
so if you look at the gdpr which i think

435
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
everyone is now familiar with uh or at

436
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
least you've heard of

437
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639
uh the the big beast that's rather scary

438
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
um for many um perhaps undeservedly so

439
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
the gdpr certainly features resilience

440
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,160
as a component of security so in the

441
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,799
gdpr system security comes up at a

442
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,839
higher level than does resilience it's

443
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
it's a property of security

444
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,119
and i've i've laid that out for you

445
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,079
uh in in by referring to some provisions

446
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
in article 32 of the gdpr which are

447
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,919
basically about security and security by

448
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
design

449
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,200
however if you go to the nis directive

450
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
the directive on network and information

451
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
security you'll see that resilience

452
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
actually isn't mentioned

453
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
and the

454
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
definition of network and information

455
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,160
system security uh only hints at

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
resilience by this notion of resist

457
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,600
but i'm not convinced that resistance is

458
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
necessarily the same as resilience

459
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,480
to me

460
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
resistance

461
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,799
could connect simply the ability to

462
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,919
counter and defend against attack

463
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
whereas resilience also connotes the

464
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
ability to maintain or resume operations

465
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,880
during or after an attack so while there

466
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
is a lot of overlap they are not

467
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,880
necessarily fully commensurate with each

468
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
other and if you look at the um

469
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,640
some of the new legislative proposals

470
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
coming through

471
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,039
they are pitching security as

472
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
a property of resilience so

473
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
the directive the proposed directive on

474
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
resilience and critical entities

475
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,679
definitely

476
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,520
resilience as the

477
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
umbrella term and security as part of

478
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,400
that

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,480
which is quite different to the gdpr

480
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
framework and marrying those two

481
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
frameworks is not necessarily going to

482
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,840
be that easy certainly at a at a

483
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
conceptual uh level

484
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
um and you might think ah concept

485
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
concept concepts conceptual model

486
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
doesn't really matter matter we just get

487
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
on with the job but

488
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,240
when you have these sort of uh key

489
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,280
concepts that are replicated across

490
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
multiple domains it does become

491
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
important to have a pretty clear picture

492
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
of what we're talking about

493
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
and as

494
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,919
benoit

495
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
du pont has said resilience is a

496
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,080
powerful

497
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
conceptual tool

498
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
but it is sufficiently ambiguous that it

499
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
can become

500
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,640
counterproductive if used carelessly and

501
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
that's what i'm a bit worried about and

502
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,400
those of you who are from the nato

503
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
framework you might be going ah eu eu

504
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,160
they can

505
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
it doesn't really matter it does matter

506
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
because nato and the eu are increasingly

507
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,799
interlocking

508
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,240
themselves at the level of policy as was

509
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
made clear earlier today

510
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
nato is delivering soft law eu

511
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
predominantly hard law but the idea is

512
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,360
that they are to be interoperable

513
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
systems so they need to speak the same

514
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
language and have much the same

515
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,480
definitions within that language

516
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
over to some examples of what i would

517
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,520
regard as an overly simplistic

518
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
differentiation between a resilience

519
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
approach and a security approach

520
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
this is drawing from the work of

521
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
frederick burke and his colleagues that

522
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
i referenced earlier

523
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
and this is a table taken from from an

524
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,559
article they published a few years ago

525
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,280
where they basically sum up

526
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,000
cyber cyber security in terms of

527
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,559
a rather

528
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
superficial

529
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
one-layered

530
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,240
uni-dimensional

531
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,960
fail-safe

532
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
focused approach

533
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,440
whereas cyber resilience they are saying

534
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
is much more

535
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,640
holistic

536
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
it is much more sensitive to

537
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
interconnectedness

538
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,799
and it has a built-in

539
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,440
element that cyber security does not

540
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,720
have

541
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,600
and

542
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
i think this depiction

543
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,720
while there is some merit in it

544
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,919
does

545
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,919
lay out the differentiation in a rather

546
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,840
simplistic

547
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
way

548
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,880
and

549
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
i mean just to to to elaborate a bit

550
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,919
they they they say resilience is

551
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
is built in

552
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
so in other words a resilience approach

553
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,720
would have a much more profound effect

554
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
on the systems being secured leading to

555
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,320
the need to let the resilience be in a

556
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,039
part of the it systems blah blah blah

557
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,120
this is an effect very similar to a by

558
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
design approach

559
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,080
that we see being propounded by the eu

560
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
at the legislative level in the gdpr

561
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,520
articles 25 and 32 on data protection by

562
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,919
design and by default and security by

563
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,280
design

564
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
on the on the other side and to some

565
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
extent the eu cyber security act

566
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
but this is not acknowledged

567
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,799
uh in that in that particular discourse

568
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
so this discourse is happening to large

569
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
extent without

570
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
a sufficient

571
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
eye to what is happening at the

572
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
legislative level

573
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
and my argument is that eu legislative

574
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,600
reform in the cyber

575
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
space dimension is becoming a lot more

576
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,480
holistic a lot more focused on building

577
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
solutions in a lot more concerned on

578
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
making sure that security is not simply

579
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
a last-minute add-on

580
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
than

581
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
burke and colleagues would

582
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,399
indicate

583
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
the other thing that

584
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
the analysis by burke and others

585
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,120
overlooks is that

586
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,520
resilience comes with differing levels

587
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,799
of ambition

588
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,000
so for example they define resilience as

589
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
an ability to maintain

590
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
continuous

591
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
delivery of

592
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
intended

593
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,320
outcomes whereas if you look at the

594
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,360
us

595
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,159
presidential policy directive on digital

596
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,159
infrastructure security and resilience

597
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
from the obama administration

598
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
yes way back then um

599
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
you'll see resilience being framed more

600
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,960
in the terms of an ability to prepare

601
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
for and adapt to

602
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
changing conditions

603
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
now the

604
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
framing of resilience in terms of

605
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
continuous delivery of intended outcomes

606
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,960
that's a very very high call

607
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
and i would argue that is at least as

608
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
unrealistic as a an ambitious call for

609
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,679
cyber security

610
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,080
so it's not the case in my opinion that

611
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
a cyber resilience focused discourse is

612
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
going to be necessarily more pragmatic

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
and easily implementable than a cyber

614
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,279
security focused discourse

615
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,240
also

616
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,039
practically speaking um if you look at

617
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
security engineering literature and if

618
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
you look at security engineering

619
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
practices and i'm talking about state of

620
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,400
the art now i'm not talking about the

621
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
sort of cyber security practices that

622
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
came to light during the 2017 equifax

623
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,640
hack

624
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,799
i mean the the security practices that

625
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,440
came to light then or lack of were

626
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,679
almost mind-boggling

627
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,720
but if you're talking about state

628
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
state-of-the-art security engineering it

629
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,279
is to a large extent about resilience

630
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,520
and this quote is taken from ross

631
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,640
anderson's

632
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
excellent but

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,120
very very big book

634
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
on security engineering uh where he

635
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
writes providing the ability to to

636
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,919
recover from security failures

637
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,919
uh is the main purpose of the protection

638
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,480
budget for many organizations at a more

639
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
technical level there are significant

640
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
interactions between protection

641
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,520
read security and resilience mechanisms

642
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,320
and then over to law as i've already

643
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
said

644
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
if you look at eu legislative frameworks

645
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
at least they are becoming a lot more uh

646
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
holistic

647
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
iterative design oriented and

648
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
realistic

649
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
have a look for example recital 12 of

650
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,559
the eu cyber security act from 2018

651
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,679
recital 12 you know it presumes

652
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,720
attacks

653
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
it presumes to some extent failure so it

654
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
is embracing a

655
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
safe to fail modus

656
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,080
already it's it's not explicit but i

657
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
think you can read into

658
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
uh the thrust of recital 12 that sort of

659
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
awareness

660
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,840
and in terms of security by design

661
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,640
uh this is all about embedding security

662
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,200
into the heart of information systems

663
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,279
architecture development and indeed

664
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,440
within the heart of the organizations

665
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
deploying those systems as opposed to a

666
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
situation where security is simply a

667
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
last-minute add-on security by design is

668
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,039
now embedded in the eu regulatory system

669
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,520
particularly with respect to

670
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,760
personal data systems but also

671
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
increasingly with respect to

672
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,360
non-personal data systems and there's a

673
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,000
whole raft of legislation that sort of

674
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
interlocks

675
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,240
reinforces each other that promotes

676
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,039
security by design so thus we are we do

677
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,279
have strong parallels at the legislative

678
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,000
level in the eu system to the thrust of

679
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
a resilience approach as portrayed by

680
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
burek and his colleagues

681
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,399
um

682
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
yeah those are some some examples in

683
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
addition to the gdpr

684
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
so look at the cyber security act as i

685
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
just mentioned the

686
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,279
current nis directive i would argue has

687
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,200
security by design

688
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
implicit within it and with the nis2

689
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
directive it's even more implic

690
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,200
it's more explicit uh the electronic

691
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
communications code medical devices

692
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,360
regulation and the proposed ai act

693
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,039
finally

694
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,240
if

695
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,440
we do ditch or attempt to ditch cyber

696
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
security

697
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
in favor of cyber resilience

698
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
we will in certain jurisdictions run

699
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
into major legal problems

700
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
because human rights jurisprudence at

701
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
least in europe

702
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
mandates

703
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,399
a high and ambitious level of security

704
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,240
for personal data

705
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
and the ambition gets higher the more

706
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,159
sensitive the data

707
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,840
so there are two very important

708
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,880
decisions that must not be forgotten

709
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,919
they uh the first one is um

710
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
decision by the court and strasbourg the

711
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
european court of human rights in iron

712
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
finland

713
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
which in effect

714
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,600
mandates by design and to some extent

715
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
data protection by design as part of

716
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,520
a

717
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,120
state party's

718
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
obligations under article 8 which is

719
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
about the right to respect the private

720
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,159
life

721
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,320
and communications under article 8 of

722
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,159
the european convention on human rights

723
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,080
that that case as some of you know had

724
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
to do with the failure by a finnish

725
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
public

726
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
hospital to

727
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
ensure that

728
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
patient data were kept confidential and

729
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,320
the finn said oh yeah we've got law

730
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
uh the court said um the law is not

731
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
enough you have to have practical

732
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
organizational measures in place as well

733
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
and in effect they were saying you've

734
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
got to have security by design

735
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,799
so that's part of uh

736
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,440
in a sense the human rights obligations

737
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,320
of all

738
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
uh european states that are party to the

739
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,399
european convention on human rights and

740
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,600
that's basically everyone uh bar um

741
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,080
uh one or two countries to the east that

742
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,840
need not be mentioned

743
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
um and then

744
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
in terms of the court of justice of the

745
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
european union uh the famous digital

746
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,559
rights island case that basically shot

747
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,559
down the data digital

748
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,520
uh

749
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
the data traffic directive that is also

750
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,720
in effect baked security by design into

751
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,279
articles seven and eight of the chart of

752
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,480
fundamental rights so any attempt to

753
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,279
ditch a

754
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
a fail safe strategy for a safe to fail

755
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,039
strategy is going to run into problems

756
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,320
with these two courts

757
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
and

758
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
finally

759
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,000
i think

760
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,080
resilience has a valuable role to play

761
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,279
and i think it has been very important

762
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
in invigorating

763
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,919
cyber security discourse it's made cyber

764
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,640
security discourse as it were sort of

765
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,360
stand to attention

766
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,000
look in and ask are we doing a good job

767
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
and

768
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,559
resilience has i think led to the

769
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,200
creation of to use the words of one of

770
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,559
my colleagues at the university of oslo

771
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,240
a self-made emergent and strictly

772
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
temporary notion of security in other

773
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,799
words security is never final

774
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,279
it's hard one it's contingent it's

775
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
transitory and it is ultimately

776
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
imperfect thank you

777
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
thank you so much lee for for this

778
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,000
also a good question or a reminder for

779
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
ourselves that

780
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
when we are doing something like

781
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,799
changing the notions and changing the

782
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,039
emphasis do we know what we are doing

783
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
and are we actually heading the direct

784
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,120
in in the direction that we intended to

785
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
and i'm tempted to abuse my my role as

786
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,640
the moderator and ask you a

787
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
a kind of a philosophical question uh

788
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,919
aren't we

789
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,240
how helpful is it actually to take a

790
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,799
notion that serves better perhaps as a

791
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,279
as a strategic communications notion and

792
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,760
strip it down into a into like a legal

793
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,640
uh

794
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,399
defined uh

795
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,640
legal term of art or aren't we stripping

796
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,840
something

797
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
uh something important

798
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
uh a way if we if you try to like shape

799
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,159
it into a into a strict legal obligation

800
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,480
with uh with clear boundaries

801
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,159
because i think that's partially what

802
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,000
has happened with our resilience and

803
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,840
security uh

804
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,640
uh

805
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,159
discourse and also the the ambition to

806
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,039
to write it into into our legislation so

807
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,840
uh

808
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
are those terms perhaps intended and

809
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,799
useful to exist in parallel

810
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,039
uh i i think they're definitely useful

811
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,240
to have but both need to be at the table

812
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
um both need to be in a sense holding

813
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,679
hands

814
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,679
uh perhaps even sharing the same bed

815
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,159
you know mixed metaphors

816
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,399
and um

817
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,799
in terms of the degree to which you

818
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,360
start to strip them down you have to

819
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,200
make some attempt to do so

820
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,919
in order to operationalize them

821
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
i i know this when talking to security

822
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,039
engineers

823
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,840
who are you know bewildered by the gdpr

824
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
which is full of very diffuse

825
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
uh highly abstract terms and they're

826
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,760
saying

827
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,080
what do these mean you know so we have

828
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
to communicate

829
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,159
across silos from one epistemic

830
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,840
community you know the legal

831
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,679
community over to a lot of other

832
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,440
communities and to do so we need to have

833
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
some definitions that are fairly

834
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,720
concrete that give the ability to to to

835
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,120
make rules of the road for each of those

836
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,519
communities uh and if we don't then we

837
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,440
will just have um

838
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,240
blurry vision state yeah and and the law

839
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
existing to a large extent as wallpaper

840
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,480
you know nice to have looks great but um

841
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
does it do anything

842
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,120
that's a fair point per answer thanks

843
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,919
but inevitably we can never ever

844
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
strip these concepts back to

845
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
totally clear definitions or a checklist

846
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
that clears you if you've reached the

847
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,519
the bottom line

848
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,320
well

849
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,840
you need some sort of checklist but you

850
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
shouldn't

851
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
you shouldn't encourage a checklist

852
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
mentality

853
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,720
no

854
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,600
thanks

855
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,120
i like that answer

856
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
and next up

857
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
max

858
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
speaking about the role of military

859
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,120
cyber exercises and in particular the

860
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,440
case study of locked shields and before

861
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,880
i let you uh

862
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
get started i

863
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,240
also in for a bit of shameless

864
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
advertising about your your new book

865
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
published this year with the oxford

866
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,600
university press on uh title no

867
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
shortcuts why states struggle to develop

868
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
a military cyber force and also your

869
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,320
upcoming

870
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,600
this disrupt or deceive assessing cyber

871
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
conflict as an intelligence uh

872
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,799
contest so i think your your article is

873
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,760
actually

874
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
uh

875
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
circling on on many of the same topics

876
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,240
that you that you address in your in

877
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,200
your books as well so delighted to uh to

878
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,239
welcome you

879
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,760
thank you yeah

880
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
you can feel free to stand or sit down

881
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,239
however you feel more convenient

882
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,199
so

883
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,639
yeah the paper that i wrote for this

884
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,040
year cycon is about um the role of

885
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,839
military cyber exercises and i used

886
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,839
locked shields as a case study i'm very

887
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,320
grateful that nato ccdcoe

888
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,719
gave me also access to the um to the

889
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,719
after action reports to write this paper

890
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,960
and uh and also everyone else yeah

891
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
including some of the people here in the

892
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,960
room who was able to interview for that

893
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,599
but what i want to do for this talk

894
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
is to embed this paper in a much larger

895
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,199
context about nato's current

896
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
institutional and operational

897
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,440
developments

898
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
so we start off

899
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,839
i wanted to start off with with this

900
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,720
graph to simply showcase that first of

901
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,240
all we have seen over the past decade

902
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,040
all nato allies establishing a cyber

903
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
strategy most of them uh the greater

904
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
majority a cyber defense strategy and

905
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,960
since 2018 the majority of nato allies

906
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,240
also establishing a cyber command so a

907
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
real institutionalization

908
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,160
of military cyber efforts

909
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,720
but what's interesting is of course that

910
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
we also see differences across the

911
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
different cyber commands or similar

912
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
units that have been established

913
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,160
and one rough distinction that we can

914
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,040
make

915
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
is that there are few countries of which

916
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,520
most obviously the united states

917
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,400
that have a cyber command with an active

918
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
peacetime mission allowed to do

919
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,480
reconnaissance and even conduct effect

920
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
operations in peace time so effect

921
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,560
operations here those operations that

922
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
seek to disrupt deny the great and or

923
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,119
destroy

924
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
but the greater majority of commands

925
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,880
that have been established

926
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
follow in a different bucket

927
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
and that's that they have only a wartime

928
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
mission where the cyber command really

929
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,359
serves to support other military

930
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,440
operations potentially as a multiplier

931
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,359
effect

932
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,720
and they're not allowed to conduct

933
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
effect operations in peace time and in

934
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,400
fact many of them are not even allowed

935
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
to do reconnaissance in peace time i.e

936
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,320
gain access to certain systems and even

937
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
some of them not even allowed to do

938
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,359
any significant type of intelligence

939
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,760
collection all being put in the hands of

940
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,640
the intel agencies

941
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,280
and so for this the second category the

942
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,119
far greater majority of cyber commands

943
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,720
that exist

944
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
um

945
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,839
this notion that

946
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,720
stefan rosen once wrote on for

947
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,760
military

948
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,839
organizations more generally applies

949
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,359
here where he says almost every

950
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,680
government bureaucracy has a function it

951
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,599
executes on a day-to-day basis military

952
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,040
organizations in countries exist in

953
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,880
order to fight a foreign enemy and do

954
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
not execute this function every day most

955
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,119
of the time the countries they serve are

956
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,800
at peace military organizations plan and

957
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,079
prepare for war but they do not fight it

958
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,640
of course most of the cyber ones are not

959
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,440
again i'm doing this on an ongoing basis

960
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
now the key is

961
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
when we have tried to evaluate the

962
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,079
particularly in contrast to again the

963
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,640
u.s notion and primarily around

964
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
persistent engagement and to operate

965
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
continuously globally seamlessly versus

966
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
the more

967
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
cyber commands with the only wartime

968
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
mission and perhaps to deter

969
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,880
in in peace time

970
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
with simply the existence of a command

971
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,520
and a supposed capacity and we have

972
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,200
assessed these along a number of

973
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,880
interesting questions that are really

974
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,839
valid

975
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,800
you know

976
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,920
which strategy is more escalatory

977
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,200
or can you deter you know activity or

978
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,920
not or you know if we pick and choose a

979
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
strategy on how the cyber command should

980
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,079
operate can you influence perhaps the

981
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,240
bargaining process of other countries or

982
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,160
adversaries and how do certain

983
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,920
strategies risk

984
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
alliance friction

985
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,520
the point that i want to make here

986
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,079
is that we have missed the key element

987
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,359
in our assessment

988
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
and that's what i call the strategy

989
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,119
capability link

990
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,520
because how is cyber command strategic

991
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,440
outlook and mandate is formed directly

992
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
influences

993
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,680
its forced development

994
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,400
now the key element that links these two

995
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,119
together is of course what is

996
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,280
force and capability development when we

997
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,520
talk about offensive cyber capabilities

998
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,400
well

999
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
in my book i described five elements

1000
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
people exploits tools infrastructure and

1001
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,280
organization but really as general

1002
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
narcissoni said in his keynote this

1003
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
morning

1004
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,000
people are by far the most important

1005
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,920
element and we're talking here about

1006
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,000
quite a wide range of different people

1007
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
not just

1008
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,200
your technical skills right your

1009
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,640
vulnerability analysts or your

1010
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,320
developers or your operators your system

1011
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,640
administrators but a wider range such as

1012
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
your legal experts or your strategist

1013
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
and so on

1014
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,720
and so the key question

1015
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,599
that

1016
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,160
then brings this together is well the

1017
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,079
real challenge is for a cyber command is

1018
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,839
to have this competent trained and

1019
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,599
experienced personnel as one cyber

1020
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,680
commander mentioned actually at cycon a

1021
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
couple of years ago so cyber force

1022
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,480
generation and degeneration

1023
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
is primarily about recruitment training

1024
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,680
and retention of personnel

1025
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,160
and all three aspects i would argue a

1026
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,599
lot more difficult

1027
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,119
with a limited peacetime mission

1028
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,760
so let me provide a very brief

1029
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,000
illustrative but also exploratory case

1030
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
study

1031
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
or vignette and that's of the dutch

1032
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,800
defense cyber command

1033
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,520
so the dcc was established in june

1034
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
2015 came out of the task force cyber

1035
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,359
a couple of defense cyber strategies

1036
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,040
have been published over the years that

1037
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
guide um

1038
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,000
how

1039
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,480
the dcc and and the dutch ministry of

1040
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
defense will generally operate and very

1041
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,319
clearly from the first one that was

1042
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,839
established already before the cyber

1043
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,200
command was there was you know if

1044
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
military cyber operations are conducted

1045
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,319
they are very much

1046
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,119
done

1047
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,720
in conjunction with other military

1048
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,079
operations and there is clearly a

1049
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,880
wartime mission that was the focus

1050
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,040
with a narrow mandate as to when um the

1051
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,319
dcc is able to to operate

1052
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,319
that fits within this kind of initial

1053
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,200
bucket

1054
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,160
that i discussed earlier

1055
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,359
as a result it hasn't conducted any and

1056
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,760
to anyone's knowledge specific cyber

1057
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,079
effect operations so those operations to

1058
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,480
disrupt deny degrade and or destroy of

1059
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,240
course the intelligence services and we

1060
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,040
can get to that in a second as well

1061
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,680
have been prominent in of course doing a

1062
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
great deal of espionage ups but the

1063
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,880
cyber command hasn't conducted effect

1064
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,520
operations

1065
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,720
now what this has led to

1066
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,680
um

1067
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,640
is

1068
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,359
this this link again between a rather

1069
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,480
narrow

1070
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,880
strategic outlook and mandate to

1071
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,800
potentially the difficulties of

1072
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,480
capability development and i've put one

1073
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
quote here from

1074
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,319
from elena booker de sullivan the former

1075
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,560
cyber commander of the dcc

1076
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,720
um where she said um

1077
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,480
the young and highly motivated cyber

1078
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
experts within the dcc are having

1079
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,200
problems with the current mandate and

1080
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,720
its legal framework where she primarily

1081
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,880
focuses on this creativity element

1082
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
and improvisation

1083
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,680
the difficulty here is to say right what

1084
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
can we do to make sure if we have this

1085
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,000
limited peacetime mission to break the

1086
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
link

1087
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
between

1088
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,440
a

1089
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,359
strategy where we don't operate on an

1090
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,880
ongoing basis and and capability and as

1091
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
a result of that the dcc is also

1092
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,119
exploratory as a case study you could

1093
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,560
say

1094
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,920
because it gives us a number of

1095
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,560
different aspects as to what they have

1096
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,440
done to still be able to train recruit

1097
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,520
and retain talent

1098
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,280
most principally of

1099
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
perhaps one of the key ones given the

1100
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,400
paper that i've written

1101
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,560
for for psycho this year it is the

1102
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
participation in in cyber exercises

1103
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,319
um there are also others which i will

1104
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,040
not touch upon too much today such as

1105
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,440
the creation of the cyber reserve force

1106
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,160
and

1107
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,640
the new cyber mission forces that seek

1108
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,280
to better integrate intel

1109
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,359
and and the military each of them i

1110
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,160
would argue come with benefits but also

1111
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
with significant limitations

1112
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,119
so let me now with this context

1113
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,920
briefly talk about the role also of of

1114
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,160
military cyber exercises and this this

1115
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,440
paper

1116
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,280
so when i um

1117
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,960
started looking into this paper i wanted

1118
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,319
to look we've seen of course the

1119
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,079
proliferation of military cyber

1120
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,480
exercises and i wanted to look at the

1121
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
value

1122
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
of them across a number of different

1123
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
dimensions and as i mentioned i took

1124
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,599
then locked chills as a case study but

1125
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,319
locked shields be mindful is a defense

1126
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,119
focus exercise and the the elements of

1127
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,040
locked shields have significantly

1128
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,440
changed over the years where a great

1129
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,160
number of of blue teams have been added

1130
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
the exercise and the scenarios have

1131
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,040
become more complex as some of you here

1132
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,599
in the room will know who are directly

1133
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,000
involved in developing

1134
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,680
these scenarios

1135
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,319
over time

1136
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,839
one thing that i felt became very clear

1137
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,040
from

1138
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,079
looking at the uh the after action

1139
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,119
reports and talking to a range of num a

1140
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,960
range of people is

1141
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,920
that

1142
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,319
yes there is clearly a great deal of

1143
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,359
value

1144
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,880
of organizing

1145
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,920
um

1146
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,920
a military exercise like locked shields

1147
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,000
on the strategic level it can actually

1148
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,560
serve as as a signaling function and yes

1149
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,640
it is notable that it is organized in

1150
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
tallinn and perhaps not somewhere

1151
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,359
perhaps further off of the russian

1152
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,040
border

1153
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,880
it can also allow at an operational

1154
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,760
level

1155
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,720
for

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
operational experimentation for example

1157
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,520
how big should your teams be is a small

1158
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,480
team actually better than a large team

1159
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,400
what is the benefit or risks of putting

1160
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,160
two teams or two different nations

1161
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,480
together are they actually still able to

1162
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,359
communicate and on the skills element

1163
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,359
yes you see real benefits as well and

1164
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,200
they particularly come in on the

1165
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,119
communication side making sure that

1166
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,560
within teams

1167
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,680
you get your techies perhaps talking to

1168
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
more of the policy folks and get better

1169
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,680
getting a sense of how they are able to

1170
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,960
communicate

1171
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,560
but at the same time

1172
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,359
when it comes to really learning new

1173
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,920
technical skills

1174
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,640
that's inherently challenging

1175
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,680
um

1176
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,000
and at the same time of course that is a

1177
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,800
way

1178
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
in which it was initially meant

1179
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
to provide

1180
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,000
so

1181
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,800
um

1182
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
it shows the benefits of doing it but it

1183
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,720
also shows that it is by no means and i

1184
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
think you can generalize this for very

1185
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,920
for

1186
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
for most of the other exercises that

1187
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
i've looked at in perhaps slightly less

1188
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,079
detail but but overall and certainly the

1189
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,640
ones internationally taking place

1190
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,359
exercises are never a perfect substitute

1191
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,599
and that's just with all exercises for

1192
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,520
um for actual operations but

1193
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
particularly in cyber given the

1194
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
challenges of creating a true virtual

1195
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,920
domain in which you can operate um

1196
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,839
sufficiently to

1197
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,560
practice your tactics techniques and

1198
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,040
procedures

1199
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
and so i want to conclude here and

1200
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,920
hopefully we can have then

1201
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
some time for discussion

1202
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,280
is that

1203
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,200
when you have a cyber command that

1204
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,520
doesn't have a mission in peace time

1205
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
right where you may conduct an operation

1206
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,680
perhaps once every four years

1207
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,520
you need to think through what are you

1208
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,440
gonna do in this other four years to

1209
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
make sure that your people are not gonna

1210
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,440
leave that there is no unlearning that

1211
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,599
there is no ability that they can keep

1212
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,200
growing and that they're not moving

1213
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,240
perhaps

1214
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,760
to the private sector where um

1215
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,480
the uh the salary is higher and in some

1216
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,160
cases actually the job might be more

1217
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,319
interesting too or jump over to some of

1218
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,240
the intelligence units so it's the key

1219
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,400
question on making sure that the skills

1220
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,599
and knowledge remains current and

1221
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,160
continue to develop and the job remains

1222
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,640
sufficiently sufficiently interesting

1223
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,800
now i put here military cyber exercises

1224
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
are are of course too limited in that

1225
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,880
but actually when you look across the

1226
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,200
board i feel that

1227
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,359
i can't think of many

1228
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,240
cyber commands across europe

1229
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,920
particularly continental europe that

1230
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,079
have figured that out

1231
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,040
to still be able to create a workforce

1232
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
and above all maintain it with high

1233
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,880
retention rates

1234
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,800
and of course integration with

1235
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,599
intelligence is necessary but also that

1236
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,560
is not a a silver bullet you hear it too

1237
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,920
often and the reason for that is

1238
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,119
particularly on the capability

1239
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,560
development side

1240
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,040
where um some of the mistakes are made

1241
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,319
of integrating

1242
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,839
your intelligence tools too much

1243
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,359
potentially with your military tools

1244
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,000
after putting all of them in all of your

1245
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,400
acts kind of in the same basket

1246
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,800
increasing burn rates and so on i'll

1247
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,720
leave it here and then hopefully we have

1248
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,520
some time for discussion as well

1249
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,640
thanks very much max i

1250
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,440
yes

1251
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,520
i do appreciate your uh your sort of

1252
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
summary of uh what i think many in the

1253
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,400
of those who had the who've had the

1254
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,680
luxury of uh of having a footing in both

1255
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,359
the strategic but also on the

1256
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,760
operational and technical sort of

1257
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,599
playing fields

1258
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,359
realizing

1259
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,240
that

1260
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
that the strategic objectives and the

1261
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,240
act realities of capability development

1262
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,079
don't necessarily come together the way

1263
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,200
we intend

1264
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,440
uh how much do you think or how do you

1265
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,240
think cyber brought cyber exercise such

1266
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,160
as locked shields

1267
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
which is trying to kill so many flies

1268
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,559
with the with one go like

1269
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,640
give the technical train the technical

1270
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,880
skills train cooperation

1271
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,720
uh how much can it actually at the same

1272
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,520
time

1273
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,640
drive home this uh this realization of a

1274
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,480
better integration between

1275
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,240
civilian and military or

1276
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,960
the

1277
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,359
the needs of uh like

1278
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,319
modern uh or capability development in a

1279
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,119
modern societal workforce

1280
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,880
um yeah to some degree it can we

1281
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,359
shouldn't just over do uh but we

1282
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,680
shouldn't um over promise what it is

1283
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,920
able to deliver in like two or three day

1284
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,160
exercise and there's been so much

1285
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,720
emphasis given to them sometimes of

1286
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,800
course also because they are so publicly

1287
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,119
so easy showcaseable

1288
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,640
that um

1289
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,200
yeah it's a perhaps a basic argument but

1290
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,000
it shouldn't be seen as a substitution

1291
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,720
i say this whilst there is worth making

1292
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,359
another point is that when you think

1293
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,880
across

1294
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,119
further alliance

1295
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,440
integration opportunities

1296
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,760
they are in the testing and training

1297
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,160
space so they are not in the tool

1298
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,640
sharing or exploit sharing space

1299
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,880
where there are much greater risks as to

1300
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
when you share it reduces your own

1301
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,200
capacity to use them and so on

1302
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,839
so it is really in and this is also

1303
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,040
where

1304
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,599
most of the costs will be in the future

1305
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,640
um

1306
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
for for most of the cyber commands and

1307
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
most of the car sharing is possible that

1308
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,640
we haven't seen before so it's

1309
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240
it's on the one hand i'm making argument

1310
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,720
is like what we see today is is overly

1311
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,119
limited and it can't fill up this huge

1312
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,880
large gap of i would say almost

1313
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,119
day-to-day inactivity

1314
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,760
um but there is also an enormous amount

1315
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,880
of opportunity to for for allies

1316
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
to um

1317
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,240
to really come together but i'm not

1318
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,559
talking here about a few million dollar

1319
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,240
initiatives i'm talking about u.s style

1320
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,880
one billion dollar initiatives and and

1321
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,599
like the the us army does but then do

1322
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,880
this combined with many allies um so

1323
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,079
some of this cost sharing is possible

1324
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,319
thank you and i'm realizing that we

1325
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,520
would like to uh give full time to uh to

1326
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,400
chant you to present his paper but also

1327
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,520
spare some time for for q a so

1328
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,520
it's always this uh this tension so i'm

1329
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,760
not stealing away a moment more from uh

1330
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,000
from your time

1331
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,520
and

1332
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,559
you will

1333
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,640
share your a more more practical take

1334
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,720
perhaps on uh and your thoughts about

1335
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,280
public-private partnerships and uh

1336
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,680
collective cyber defense so john the the

1337
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,960
floor and the

1338
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,119
session audience is all yours go thank

1339
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,880
you and i'm conscious i'm probably going

1340
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,559
to annoy quite a few people in here so

1341
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,400
feel free to come yell at me afterwards

1342
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,800
that's the second feature though so

1343
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,359
quite welcome here so um my name is john

1344
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,200
solomon i think as a bit of context i

1345
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,040
think it would help to say that i

1346
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,240
support an organization called the

1347
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,160
financial services information sharing

1348
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,400
analysis center quite a mouthful but

1349
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,319
essentially an industry partnership

1350
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,079
globally uh it's one of the largest ice

1351
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,920
sacks of many many dozens around the

1352
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,119
world

1353
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,559
consisting of a combination of

1354
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,000
operational coordination and

1355
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,359
industry membership

1356
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,520
ranging into several thousands across

1357
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,839
dozens of countries worldwide

1358
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,440
the idea behind the isac is to

1359
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,200
essentially reduce risk to to

1360
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,640
participants in critical national

1361
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,119
industry by fostering participation

1362
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,599
collaboration information sharing and

1363
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,200
i'll get into a little bit of that uh

1364
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,680
and how we can contextualize this in in

1365
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,680
the sense of how it can assist in

1366
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
national defense in building resiliency

1367
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,040
in ensuring stability for uh concerned

1368
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
countries as well as across borders i'm

1369
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,720
going to stay seated because first of

1370
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,319
all these chairs are very comfortable

1371
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,760
it's better for my speaker notes and

1372
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,520
after watching these frankly terrifying

1373
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,839
videos about robot tanks with machine

1374
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,520
guns i'm inclined to keep my head down

1375
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,160
as much as possible um

1376
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,599
but also because i think this ought to

1377
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,200
be kind of a conversation that we are

1378
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,040
having rather than you know me talking

1379
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,440
to you this is in no way intended to be

1380
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,200
prescriptive i am not speaking god's own

1381
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,960
truth i am a civilian i am thoroughly

1382
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,319
conscious of that i am also not an

1383
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,680
academic so my perspective is isn't

1384
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,760
completely that of private industry i'm

1385
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,760
born of 25 years of experience

1386
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,880
internationally i uh i'm here and thank

1387
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,079
you for having me and i'm here to

1388
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,680
stimulate some discussions on how we can

1389
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,800
mobilize

1390
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,040
uh private sector resources industry

1391
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,760
resources to enhance the overall

1392
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,319
defensive posture and capabilities of

1393
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,400
like-minded countries and entire

1394
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,599
societies

1395
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,400
um

1396
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,880
i wrote this paper initially when uh

1397
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,480
we were privileged enough to be allowed

1398
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,800
to support locked shields this year with

1399
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,000
a financial

1400
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
services focused set of modules one of

1401
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,800
my colleagues is in the audience here

1402
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,960
did a absolutely fabulous job

1403
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,040
in coordinating uh most of this from the

1404
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,720
financial sector side peter from cuddy

1405
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,319
swiss well done

1406
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,800
um and i started writing this paper

1407
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,559
based on some initial experiences and

1408
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,079
and observations of hey we could

1409
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,839
actually do this better and i it is a

1410
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,200
thoroughly naive

1411
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
blue-eyed naivete and i thought well you

1412
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,480
know let's write down some thoughts and

1413
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,760
all of a sudden i was told well you have

1414
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,599
to submit a six thousand word paper

1415
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,359
which is kind of terra incognita for me

1416
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,079
and somehow it worked so um we're oh

1417
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,119
here we go i have a toy excellent um i'd

1418
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,359
like to start with a few basic you know

1419
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,040
observations and again you can fight me

1420
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,079
about this feel free i am i am simply

1421
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,440
stating this from my own experience and

1422
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,040
observations

1423
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,079
it is it is it is fact that things get

1424
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,520
more complicated and the more complex

1425
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,359
something is the easier it is to break

1426
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,839
it we are increasingly interconnected

1427
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,200
interdependent you've heard all of this

1428
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,160
before

1429
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,839
uh if from nobody else then from your

1430
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,520
information security vendors you know

1431
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,960
spreading fear uncertainty and doubt

1432
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,559
about how the bad hackers are all after

1433
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,880
us it is however also fact that threat

1434
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,079
actors are becoming increasingly

1435
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,960
professionalized uh uh sophisticated uh

1436
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
internationalized whether they're state

1437
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,359
affiliated state sponsored into you know

1438
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,160
simple criminals uh it doesn't matter

1439
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,119
how do we uh combat this well we work

1440
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,960
together you know we increasingly work

1441
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,240
together in industry

1442
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,160
the isac model is one that actually

1443
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,760
originally sprang out of an american

1444
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,280
presidential de uh

1445
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,200
ppd presidential decision directive i

1446
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,880
think it was in 1998 which was basically

1447
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,480
telling critical national industry

1448
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
sectors winter is coming do something

1449
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,160
work together figure it out

1450
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,599
and that's what happened that's what we

1451
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,640
did

1452
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,640
now the time has increasingly come to to

1453
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,319
integrate these capabilities that

1454
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,839
industry has developed over years and

1455
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,480
years of hard work and evolution into

1456
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,359
other defensive capabilities now ppp

1457
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,119
is nothing new and we'll get into that

1458
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,119
in a second uh but i think what we're

1459
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,200
ready to do is take a next step and

1460
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,640
that's why i'm here to talk to you about

1461
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,520
our

1462
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,760
thoughts about

1463
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,559
how we fit private sector into national

1464
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,520
defense capabilities

1465
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,200
this cooperation is great it doesn't

1466
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,640
work without trust

1467
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,280
if if you don't have trust which is very

1468
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
very difficult to build you cannot

1469
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,720
legislate it you cannot mandate it it

1470
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,960
takes long hard work takes events it

1471
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,880
takes years of of

1472
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,960
networking and and cooperation building

1473
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,359
and and showing willingness to integrate

1474
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,040
and interoperate um you know

1475
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,720
this requires a lot of investment things

1476
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,200
cost money right you have to be willing

1477
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,040
to invest in building trust and sending

1478
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,040
people to events allowing nice people

1479
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,319
like me to come and help with locked

1480
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,319
shields this is wonderful i think this

1481
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,160
is one of the most most phenomenal steps

1482
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,000
that i've seen in fostering this kind of

1483
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,480
trust between private sector actors and

1484
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,640
public sector and you know military is

1485
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,720
part of the public sector like it or not

1486
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,599
um

1487
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,200
and what's very important to also

1488
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,119
understand is that from our perspective

1489
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,960
from the private sector and this is a

1490
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,880
horrid horror generalization i realize

1491
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,000
this we don't care who the bad guys are

1492
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
a bit of a provocative statement there

1493
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,079
but for us the effect is the same crime

1494
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,680
is crime you know there is there the

1495
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,920
intent is is theft of resources

1496
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,160
degradation of services i don't care if

1497
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
these guys are kremlin-affiliated state

1498
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
actors if they're if they're north

1499
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
korean crime gangs who want to steal

1500
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,400
resources if they're you know spies or

1501
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,359
salvators we don't care right for us

1502
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,880
there's an impact to our customers our

1503
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
stakeholders and more broadly to the

1504
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,640
societies that we work in

1505
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,680
and

1506
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
important to realize is that everybody

1507
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,040
has been getting better at this you know

1508
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,720
again i want to bring a positive message

1509
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,040
here there's a lot of opportunity

1510
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,319
you know countering the horrible robot

1511
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,440
tanks thing skynet um

1512
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,040
we are getting better at this but we

1513
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,880
also have to understand that every actor

1514
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,400
involved in this every stakeholder has

1515
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,839
their limits

1516
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,920
private sector we cannot strike back we

1517
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,280
cannot retaliate nor should we be

1518
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,680
allowed to unless duly authorized to

1519
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,760
that's vigilantism and that that bears a

1520
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,520
whole lot of dangers with it

1521
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,359
public sector military especially has a

1522
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,040
very sensitive role law enforcement has

1523
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,520
to maintain sanctity of evidence you

1524
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,760
know respect for private individuals for

1525
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,359
private data that kind of thing so

1526
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,880
there's very very clear there needs to

1527
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,640
be a very very clear understanding of of

1528
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,000
who is capable of what what their

1529
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,400
mission is their limitations etc

1530
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,640
um well sorry i'm so used to conference

1531
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,920
where i have to go next slide please i

1532
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,240
just forgot about this thing

1533
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,079
so i only have very few slides here i

1534
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,520
promise um

1535
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,040
um it helps us to understand who the

1536
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,799
actors in this are

1537
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,400
when i say private sector in in the

1538
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,040
words of of a famous american

1539
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,440
jurist i'll know it when i see it

1540
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,760
when i when i refer to it it's not just

1541
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,000
uh uh privately traded companies it's

1542
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,480
really also anything that is is

1543
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,240
is does not have a public service

1544
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,079
mission more or less i do not have a

1545
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,319
clear definition for this but i think we

1546
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,440
can all understand that there are

1547
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,960
differences between government entities

1548
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,119
government agencies and commercial

1549
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,200
organizations or at least organizations

1550
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,680
dedicated to folk to serving individual

1551
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,400
uh customers if you will or stakeholders

1552
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,960
um

1553
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,559
one of the big things here to understand

1554
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,240
is one of the drivers behind this and

1555
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,319
and in the past years we've increasingly

1556
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,839
seen an understanding

1557
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,119
of risk

1558
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,079
now

1559
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,119
risk

1560
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,160
is

1561
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,319
the understanding that information

1562
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,359
security has a reason it's the so what

1563
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,280
that ties everything together for

1564
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,640
companies it means that information

1565
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,000
security has increasingly become a

1566
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,440
business function

1567
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,040
it supports the ability of the business

1568
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,280
to to to to continue operations and even

1569
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,319
to flourish and at a societal level

1570
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,520
regulators

1571
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,440
government agencies they want to they

1572
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,000
understand risk at a more societal level

1573
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,240
so basically this has been a a

1574
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,799
tremendous tremendous driver behind

1575
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,400
concepts such as critical national

1576
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,920
infrastructure which the last 10 years

1577
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,920
have seen an enormous growth in and this

1578
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,000
understanding that you know

1579
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,839
if a certain organization fails if it's

1580
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,680
too big to fail i hate that term there

1581
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,760
should be no such thing as my opinion

1582
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,520
but it can have an adverse societal

1583
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,280
impact and thus you know an individual

1584
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,480
organization just like an individual

1585
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
person within a company

1586
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,760
has only limited authority and

1587
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,440
competence decide to decide what they

1588
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,599
can and should not invest in yeah that's

1589
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,440
when regulation comes in and by the way

1590
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,720
i do want to address one point about

1591
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,559
gdpr that my colleague made and quite

1592
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,079
often the information security

1593
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,559
practitioners especially in context like

1594
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,119
threat information sharing understand

1595
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,559
much better than their legal audience or

1596
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,319
even the regulators what gdpr means

1597
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,559
because the carve-outs are very clear

1598
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,040
we've seen this this this this growth of

1599
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,480
understanding in the information

1600
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,880
security community of where they sit how

1601
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,480
they contextualize their activities and

1602
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,280
why it

1603
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,200
is important on a broader scale as

1604
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,720
opposed to just a bunch of geeks doing

1605
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,240
what they understand is the right thing

1606
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,359
to do right but on the whole you know in

1607
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,119
society we've seen this tremendous

1608
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,119
tremendous growth and a willingness

1609
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,599
to to drive participation at a at a

1610
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,119
whole level and this brings us to public

1611
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,640
private partnerships

1612
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,079
one of the comments on my papers was

1613
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,960
this a sneering uh response that ppp is

1614
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,240
nothing new why are you writing about

1615
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,160
this no it's not we know this this is

1616
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,440
important this is basics um but i think

1617
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,280
it is an ongoing evolutionary process

1618
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,640
and the person was absolutely right on

1619
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,400
this i'm not disagreeing with it we're

1620
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,760
seeing an evolutionary process

1621
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,440
understanding what these the challenges

1622
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,359
are what the what the the scope is of

1623
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,400
these things

1624
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,720
um you know what the mandates are

1625
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,839
and and i think based my observation as

1626
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,079
an individual as a professional is that

1627
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,000
cooperation collaboration between the

1628
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,319
private sector and the defense agencies

1629
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,920
the military is

1630
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,079
the last challenge to overcome in

1631
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,040
developing ppps and involving ppps

1632
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,440
and this is i think part of my my my

1633
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,200
slightly provocative approach here

1634
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,640
because let's face it you know in the

1635
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,040
past we've we've always had you know i

1636
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,160
think

1637
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,000
for everybody's own good

1638
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
a separation between military and

1639
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,920
private sector however in the last 50

1640
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,680
years we've seen a decline for example

1641
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,160
the the classic citizen soldier and thus

1642
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,520
increasingly a bit of a disconnect you

1643
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,280
know i'm a civilian i i

1644
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
understand basic military stuff

1645
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,160
what i read in the news but i'm

1646
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,520
obviously not a subject matter expert

1647
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,000
like most of you in here right however i

1648
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,200
because of of of my stakeholders role in

1649
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,400
protecting critical national

1650
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,280
infrastructure stabilizing society etc i

1651
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,359
have to understand that i am not working

1652
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,920
in isolation that i play a role and my

1653
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,000
my members play a role in helping to

1654
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,960
secure entire societies so i do want to

1655
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,480
also stress that i'm talking mainly

1656
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,119
about intra-national cooperation

1657
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,440
cross-border cooperation is good a lot

1658
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,119
of countries have very very strong

1659
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,520
sensitivities about sharing capabilities

1660
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,760
and info even between like-minded

1661
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,319
countries right it is a good thing it

1662
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,839
can work well it has to be done

1663
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,599
carefully and considered i just want to

1664
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,040
stress that before everybody says well

1665
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,319
we have to share everything with with

1666
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,480
all of our competitors even why are even

1667
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,799
suggesting this that's not the idea here

1668
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,680
so

1669
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,520
from our perspective

1670
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,359
where's the military coming from in here

1671
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,598
all right

1672
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,240
the military has arguably the most

1673
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,680
sensitive role of all the public sector

1674
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,359
agencies you guys have guns and drones

1675
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,960
and bombs and things right you don't

1676
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,400
want these to be misused i don't want

1677
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,240
these to be misused at least robot tanks

1678
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,000
again um

1679
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,480
and despite you know civilian oversight

1680
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,640
um the militaries have become much more

1681
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,000
professionalized there's far more

1682
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,359
subject matter experts there's better

1683
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,079
training you know my father swiss swiss

1684
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,760
army officers handbooks from the 60s

1685
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,920
still had you know guys charging at

1686
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,960
machine guns which i don't think is is

1687
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
still kind of the norm

1688
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,960
in in modern modern tactics

1689
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,920
um

1690
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,119
and

1691
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,720
i think

1692
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,799
what we're increasingly realizing is

1693
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,720
that critical national infrastructure is

1694
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,520
part of the overall set of capabilities

1695
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,359
and and the nature of the things that

1696
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,000
that make a society more stable

1697
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,640
and and more predictable and to this end

1698
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,799
um what i'm what i'm really getting at

1699
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,039
here is that i think there is a huge

1700
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,319
amount of value to be drawn from

1701
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,760
increasingly involving the private

1702
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,880
sector critical national industry in

1703
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,599
national cyber defense activities

1704
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,760
not on an individual basis but really on

1705
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,079
a sectoral basis i sacks and i'm

1706
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,880
obviously biased here can help with this

1707
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,520
you know but there's a huge number of of

1708
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,760
a variety of industry bodies out there

1709
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
with with willing people and i'm sorry i

1710
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,200
keep calling you out here peter great

1711
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,640
example right

1712
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,039
the fsi sac um

1713
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,440
brought in mobilized a number of members

1714
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,240
to contribute to varying degrees

1715
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,160
to lock shields

1716
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,000
we're again extremely grateful for this

1717
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,520
opportunity because i believe it helps

1718
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,680
us showcase look we are willing

1719
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,440
we want to help we understand that you

1720
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,599
guys have limited resources

1721
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,440
we do as well but we understand

1722
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,960
increasingly because of regulatory

1723
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,720
pressure because of societal risk

1724
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,559
management pressure that we have to play

1725
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,760
a role in this

1726
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,799
and there's another thing i'm sorry to

1727
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,319
keep picking on you but you know i want

1728
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,599
to address the comment that you made

1729
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,520
about the imaginal line

1730
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,520
imaginalani is a common punching bag

1731
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,599
it's a joke now

1732
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,200
here's something to piss everybody off

1733
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,079
imagine how lang was a good design

1734
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,359
anybody nobody's laughing that's good

1735
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,880
actually

1736
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,720
under the circumstances given

1737
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,160
demographic situations given

1738
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,000
geopolitical situations given tactical

1739
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,559
knowledge given technology however it

1740
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,960
was part of a system

1741
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,559
it was a system of communication of

1742
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,160
strategy of reserves etc and arguably

1743
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,079
you know the french lost in 1940 more

1744
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,839
because of french uh

1745
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,640
um leadership communication doctrine or

1746
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,720
the movement into france with with what

1747
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,160
should have been their mobile reserves

1748
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,559
even french use of two-man tank turrets

1749
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,640
you can argue that and likewise cyber

1750
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,720
security is part of a system if it's no

1751
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,319
longer part of a system it becomes a

1752
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,760
tool

1753
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,200
and we might as well be banging rocks

1754
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,640
against sticks

1755
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,440
all right

1756
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,359
likewise you know private sector

1757
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,119
information security is part of an

1758
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,440
overall set of capabilities

1759
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,280
in terms of defending society

1760
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,119
whether it's against criminal purely

1761
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,520
criminal actors in peace time or when we

1762
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,359
have situations such as certain

1763
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,559
countries that shall not be named

1764
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,039
becoming naughty and fallout affecting

1765
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,599
industry all across the region

1766
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,440
we're saying well we i'm not speaking

1767
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,119
for the entire industry but you know i'm

1768
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,760
trying to say this as a as a i think a

1769
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,920
typical uh industry representative

1770
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,839
involve us involve these capabilities

1771
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:58,960
work with us

1772
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,160
and i think

1773
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,839
this leads us to the again where were

1774
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,599
these i keep losing this thing sorry

1775
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,280
um i think you're really enthusiastic

1776
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,559
about this topic

1777
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,599
um

1778
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,520
i think it's important to understand um

1779
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,760
how we can do this

1780
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,599
um national cyber security agencies are

1781
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,680
often cited as a good coordination

1782
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,119
coordinating resource for this kind of

1783
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,640
activity you know people say talk to the

1784
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,880
ncsc let them deal with it

1785
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,559
there are some countries the netherlands

1786
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,920
being a great example of this where the

1787
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,160
ncsc does fabulous work

1788
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,760
integrating industry

1789
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,359
um with public services the uk the us to

1790
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,440
some degree right there's a lot of

1791
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,200
countries where this is either building

1792
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,960
or already established and working

1793
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,039
however

1794
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,200
ask yourselves what works more

1795
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,440
effectively in responding to a crisis a

1796
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,440
hierarchical clearly defined

1797
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,440
top-down approach or something involving

1798
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,839
multi-stakeholders to define the

1799
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,760
challenges to identify challenges to

1800
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,520
come up with processes and then

1801
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,119
involving those stakeholders in trust

1802
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,960
circles to to respond to these things

1803
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,480
actively

1804
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,039
pbps work with law enforcement in many

1805
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,039
countries with ncscs with regulators

1806
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,599
even it's functioning a functioning

1807
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,520
functioning model where

1808
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,200
when there are for example disruptions

1809
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,960
of botnet operators

1810
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,720
uh when there are investigations when

1811
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,559
there are massive new systemic

1812
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:15,920
challenges whether it's it's huge

1813
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,240
malware botnets new families systemic

1814
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,280
attacks

1815
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,119
we're able to respond collectively with

1816
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,799
many of our public sector stakeholders

1817
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,200
the trickbot takedown well disruption

1818
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,440
together with the fbi and microsoft and

1819
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,760
the the financial and other ice acts was

1820
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,359
a phenomenal example of this and now

1821
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,799
this is we're at the point where this

1822
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:33,760
should be

1823
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,200
expanded to

1824
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,920
cooperation with the military

1825
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,920
ecosystem if you want to say

1826
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,240
and i promised my last slide sorry i

1827
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,240
like i said henrik knows i can talk for

1828
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,720
hours on this um thanks for that by the

1829
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,039
way how do we do this

1830
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,960
the first part is where you guys come in

1831
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,240
public sector

1832
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,480
rules clear rules and expectations you

1833
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,559
create the norms you create the rules

1834
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,960
regulation is a good thing

1835
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,319
and i you know you're never never going

1836
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,680
to hear a private sector guy say this

1837
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,480
again

1838
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,319
regulation forces us to do the right

1839
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,079
thing it allows me as a practitioner to

1840
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,760
go to my management to say okay you're

1841
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,440
going to cut my budget that's fine but

1842
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,400
talk to

1843
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,839
the central bank

1844
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:12,640
right

1845
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,960
um

1846
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,280
work with ice x work with c-certs work

1847
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,880
with banking federations talk to them

1848
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,720
build relationships be open to this and

1849
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,880
i i i am a little bit late with this

1850
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,640
because we were invited to locked

1851
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,839
shields

1852
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,079
but our our participation in locked

1853
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,240
shields was not really so much in the

1854
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,680
interest of the financial sector because

1855
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
let's let's be honest the financial

1856
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,559
services sector is is one of the less

1857
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,400
systemically critical ones

1858
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,920
right we're just the biggest and the

1859
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,839
best resourced and the most mature and

1860
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:44,240
the most the most visible one but if

1861
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,319
power generation goes down

1862
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,799
then we have a real problem so use us as

1863
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,559
an example on how to work with industry

1864
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,559
bodies to incorporate them not just as

1865
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,039
individual participants but as entire

1866
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,280
groups as entire industries

1867
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,880
um

1868
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,799
really important forums

1869
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,880
anisa is actually very good at this you

1870
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,920
know there's a lot of national

1871
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,079
organizations that provide events they

1872
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,760
build the resources they they do

1873
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,280
scholarships they they encourage

1874
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,720
industry to get together because we may

1875
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,400
not on our own do that

1876
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,280
and

1877
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,359
be prepared to share

1878
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,120
we have restrictions just like you do

1879
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,279
you have you know national secrecy rules

1880
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,120
we have industry confidentiality rules

1881
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,238
there's always going to be restrictions

1882
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:24,319
on who can share what with whom we will

1883
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,000
for example only share

1884
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,920
intelligence digest within our public

1885
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,839
private partnerships network

1886
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,880
so

1887
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,520
be open to industry saying thank you

1888
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,880
received we will distribute this we

1889
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,719
would act on this we may not share

1890
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,920
exactly back to you at the same level

1891
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,359
this is okay this is part of building

1892
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,000
trust and lastly

1893
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,040
to my colleague from from zurich's point

1894
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,880
exercising is good i think this is kind

1895
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,040
of a pointless platitude to say we know

1896
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,679
this but it's not just locked shields

1897
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,759
any opportunity to train with our public

1898
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,279
sector partners is appreciated because

1899
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,920
it helps us understand where we fit into

1900
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,880
um

1901
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,040
the grand scheme of things it helps us

1902
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,040
fail actively

1903
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,560
was one of my american colleagues once

1904
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,880
said fail and practice not on the field

1905
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,399
it helps us understand where the gaps

1906
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,679
are it helps us understand what we

1907
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,040
should invest in what we should prepare

1908
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,640
for and helps understand how we can

1909
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,759
better work with you guys and talk to

1910
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,759
you guys what your languages are

1911
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,238
and i'd like to leave you with that um

1912
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,719
very very important is is is information

1913
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,120
sharing and collaboration is not just a

1914
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,719
set of platitudes it's also something

1915
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,560
that we have to do in practice on a

1916
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,120
daily basis start doing this

1917
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,679
uh i'm gonna just throw the acronym jfdi

1918
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,040
out there and leave you guys to look it

1919
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,560
up um

1920
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,120
and i'd like to to leave this as a as a

1921
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,880
you know a call to action essentially

1922
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,399
work work with the private sector talk

1923
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,359
to the private sector we don't bite um

1924
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,120
usually um

1925
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,719
we want to work with you and i think

1926
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,799
this is clear across most sectors of

1927
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,960
critical national infrastructure if you

1928
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,719
guys give leadership if you guys provide

1929
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,560
guidance and inspiration and are open to

1930
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,400
us talking to you guys we're there to

1931
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,080
support and with that i've already gone

1932
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,280
over and i'd like to wrap up thank you

1933
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,840
very much

1934
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,520
thanks a lot john i i think it's uh it's

1935
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,280
also isn't it also a manifestation of

1936
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,760
the resilience of the ecosystem that in

1937
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,440
an environment where we realized that

1938
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,280
everything is more complex and more

1939
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,000
broken than ever we also uh coming to

1940
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
the or we're working with a realization

1941
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,520
that we

1942
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,360
continuously need to

1943
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,040
nobody is equipped to deal with the

1944
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,280
wholeness themselves so we so we keep on

1945
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,880
practicing that collaboration and uh

1946
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,800
and sort of role

1947
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,040
or taking responsibility and role

1948
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,440
sharing because life forces us for that

1949
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,800
whether we have the

1950
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,199
like the the political incentives uh for

1951
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,920
it or not and i think we can see if we

1952
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,080
look across the board and

1953
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,600
also

1954
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,159
i could bring a good handful of examples

1955
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,000
of the of the cyber various setups of

1956
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,800
the involving cyber reserves in in

1957
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,239
national cyber defense and cyber

1958
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,840
security and we could spend a whole

1959
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,679
session on on that

1960
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,080
next year next to this

1961
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,920
um when i was when i was trying to

1962
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,320
recruit um uh private sector subject

1963
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,520
matter experts to work with the lock

1964
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,800
chilled blue teams one of the guys that

1965
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,080
popped up was it was a name that looked

1966
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,480
familiar in switzerland and he was a

1967
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,880
gentleman with a a punk haircut lots of

1968
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,040
piercings and neck tattoos and his name

1969
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
looked familiar and he was one of our

1970
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,040
incident response leads at ubs and now

1971
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,640
he was in uniform and camouflaged with a

1972
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,080
punk haircut and piercings and neck

1973
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,560
tattoos uh leading leading part of the

1974
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,760
blue team and i think this kind of

1975
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,000
interaction is a great start

1976
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,239
um frankly cyber security is a mess it

1977
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:37,679
is a messy business it's a messy

1978
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,360
business across borders with an industry

1979
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,840
across sectors that's okay

1980
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,520
it doesn't mean that we can stop

1981
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,600
defending and preparing and trying to

1982
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,520
prevent bad things happening but you

1983
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,440
know as you're pointing out i think um

1984
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,840
very very astutely we we also have an

1985
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,199
increasing understanding of who that

1986
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,719
what the what the components are what

1987
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,800
their importance is what we do in case

1988
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,280
of failure um how do we recover from

1989
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,400
failure and and and once we understand

1990
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,760
better who the stakeholders and

1991
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,960
participants are and again what their

1992
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,560
limitations their rules their missions

1993
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,560
whatever are because very often i i

1994
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,920
don't i have no clue you know what

1995
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,400
agency so and so can or can't do i think

1996
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,159
that makes us much more mature much more

1997
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,840
ready and much more resilient not only

1998
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,440
to prevent bad things happening but when

1999
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,760
they do happen inevitably to recover

2000
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,640
from them

2001
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,280
uh more smoothly ideally without anybody

2002
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,880
noticing and not being able to withdraw

2003
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,520
money from the cash point

2004
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,600
that was a very very good and rather

2005
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,280
realistic summary of the of the state of

2006
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,520
affairs but with uh with that i'd like

2007
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,960
to turn over it

2008
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,360
to the audience for for your chance to

2009
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,679
ask questions for uh

2010
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,080
of our excellent speakers

2011
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,880
so

2012
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,360
we have some 15 minutes left and i see

2013
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,400
quite a few hands already so uh

2014
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,040
yes please also state your name and your

2015
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,320
affiliation and

2016
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,920
and like lisa said in the main main

2017
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,440
session you're encouraging sure that the

2018
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,000
question includes a question

2019
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,760
thanks thank you so much how many tauros

2020
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,199
from the university of kent i had the

2021
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,120
question of politics and that's to a

2022
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,719
certain degree primarily for professor

2023
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,120
vagraven and dr smith so the the

2024
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,320
question for

2025
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,040
is when you move from security to

2026
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,679
resilience you're transferring the onus

2027
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,760
from the state and the private sector to

2028
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,440
the individual and the citizen you're

2029
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,600
saying it is your job to be resilient it

2030
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,080
is not my job to secure you and i wonder

2031
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,440
what you think about that in terms of

2032
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,960
cyber security because this is one of

2033
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,800
the arguments that's made in terms of

2034
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,640
resilience when it comes to security

2035
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,880
studies outside the cyber domain

2036
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,560
and for for dr smith i was wondering

2037
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,679
whether

2038
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,920
um one of the things that happened with

2039
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,080
um with the global war on terror is that

2040
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,800
it transformed war from uh the notion of

2041
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,280
war and peace as discrete moments into a

2042
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,520
continuous thing and to a certain degree

2043
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,679
what cyber command does is it does that

2044
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:48,800
it it

2045
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,480
argues that war is something that is

2046
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,719
ongoing continues and never ends and

2047
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,640
there are human implications to that and

2048
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,159
i was wondering what you'd say to that

2049
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,440
thank you

2050
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,080
thanks so

2051
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,679
given that the the first

2052
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,000
question was and comment was addressed

2053
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,239
to myself very very good uh and i really

2054
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,840
haven't thought this through

2055
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,560
but um you know my off-the-cuff response

2056
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,679
would be that i i wonder if there's a

2057
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,080
bit of a straw person being constructed

2058
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
here between a resilience mindset and a

2059
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,840
security mindset because if you actually

2060
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,199
look at say legislative mandates

2061
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,360
they're not saying that

2062
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,719
or security would be taking care of

2063
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,239
someone else

2064
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,679
they're saying no security has to be

2065
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,199
taken by care of by the

2066
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,199
the person constructing an information

2067
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,280
system or the person processing personal

2068
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,520
data if it's in the gdpr context so

2069
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,480
there's no

2070
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,400
delegation or relegation of

2071
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,120
responsibilities uh at all and i

2072
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,480
wouldn't have thought there's much

2073
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,159
difference either with a resilience

2074
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,320
approach so that's my off-the-cuff

2075
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,880
response to that but excellent it got me

2076
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,840
thinking so

2077
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,840
max would you like to comment so

2078
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,880
empirically i am is it on yeah so

2079
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,880
empirically i fully agree with you and

2080
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,120
i've written myself on the fact that yes

2081
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,880
cyber operations below the trash the

2082
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,440
bombed attack can cumulatively still be

2083
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,960
strategically meaningful and it's

2084
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,719
increasingly unclear where this

2085
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,360
threshold lies and you know i see lucas

2086
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,679
keller in the room as well who's written

2087
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,920
on the notion of unpeace where there is

2088
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,560
indeed this blurrification so

2089
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,400
on that point we are

2090
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,120
fully aligned

2091
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,920
however when you look at the way

2092
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,600
nato cyber commands currently operate

2093
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,000
it is not that they swiftly move in

2094
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
between these lines no there are still

2095
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,239
very clear notions as to potentially

2096
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,199
when

2097
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,040
and depending on the national and the

2098
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,640
country which article is triggered if

2099
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,120
this is article 100 when you know they

2100
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,360
are potentially in war when parliament

2101
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,040
then approves a potential mandate to

2102
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,840
conduct operations so and that's that's

2103
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,360
what's relevant here

2104
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,719
it's in the limited legal space

2105
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,679
as to when they are not able not just

2106
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,280
allowed to actively achieve an effect

2107
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,360
but even start the preparation to

2108
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,440
achieve an effect and anyone who has

2109
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,600
been on the operational space in this

2110
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,679
room will know that's often takes the

2111
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,600
most amount of time and you want to do

2112
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,080
this early on not just for the specific

2113
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,840
target but even just to get a

2114
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,520
better sense of the whole target space

2115
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,199
more generally and that's the struggle

2116
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,320
that that they're currently facing

2117
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,920
i know you wanted to ask yeah sorry i i

2118
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,760
just i just this one rang this one kind

2119
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,840
of rang a bell with me um first one i

2120
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,760
would like to aggressively

2121
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,239
um challenge your first assertion that

2122
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,520
the onus is being placed on the

2123
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,000
individual because critical national

2124
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,280
infrastructure part of the whole point

2125
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,080
of this is that you know key actors are

2126
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,080
being forced into becoming more secure

2127
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,440
and more resilient

2128
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,880
as they should be

2129
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,400
as well they should be

2130
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,840
it is it is it is the duty of

2131
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,760
organizations of companies to understand

2132
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,520
not only how to protect themselves and

2133
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,920
to recover from damage but also to do so

2134
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,840
in the context of societal stability and

2135
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,000
i think regulators you mentioned dora

2136
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,679
and nis ii they're great examples of

2137
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,280
this for example in terms of of

2138
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,280
increased supply chain risk management

2139
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,040
uh mandates

2140
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,719
they're becoming increasingly aware of

2141
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,560
this as well the second thing i don't

2142
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,000
think you can equip you know i don't

2143
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,760
think you can equate uh the war on

2144
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,280
terror and i

2145
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,679
personally ideologically i thoroughly

2146
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,760
agree with that sentiment

2147
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,000
with what you're seeing with cyber i

2148
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,800
think i'm gonna say attacks yeah because

2149
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,120
what is the role of the military

2150
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,880
defend against external threats i think

2151
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,320
is my off-the-cuff definition

2152
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,599
um what is war

2153
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,320
what is lazarus group

2154
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,400
a north korean state-affiliated actor

2155
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,360
causing disruption causing theft where's

2156
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,800
the border

2157
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,480
right and this is my whole point about

2158
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,400
we don't care who the actor is

2159
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,520
so

2160
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,440
should the military be engaging in this

2161
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,040
in this daily business of defending

2162
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,280
society and it's it's key actors against

2163
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,320
uh external uh cyber attacks whether the

2164
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,080
actors are steady affiliate or not i

2165
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,040
don't know that's a question for the

2166
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,560
policy americans but i think it's a it's

2167
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,320
a pretty important question to ask

2168
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,040
ourselves because this is new land

2169
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,080
you know we're dealing with something

2170
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,040
completely new here so

2171
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,239
i think this is something for the

2172
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,800
policymakers to decide very very very

2173
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,440
carefully precisely to avoid you know

2174
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,159
this conflation of well constant state

2175
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,520
of war we've always been at war with

2176
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,480
east asia

2177
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
with um with you know what we as

2178
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,320
industry are facing and citizens are

2179
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,840
facing on a daily basis in terms of

2180
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,880
attacks from whomever they may be

2181
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,640
a constitutional lawyer would say that

2182
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,560
the the threat external threat has to

2183
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,000
also be

2184
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,840
be sort of

2185
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,520
at the level of being existential so

2186
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,800
either a constitutional order or

2187
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,880
territorial integrity and cyber of

2188
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,280
course then poses the question of like

2189
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,199
where does it where does the effect

2190
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,280
actually accumulate to that level

2191
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,199
and and where do you join and where do

2192
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,880
you invite in the in the military but

2193
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,360
that's an again another conversation

2194
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,440
hey so more questions back back there

2195
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,879
yes the microphone is coming your way

2196
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,920
oh hello i'm miriam howe from ba systems

2197
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,280
um i think my question is mainly for

2198
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,880
jonathan um but i don't know if max

2199
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,640
would like to comment as well um so

2200
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,159
we've mainly talked about the sort of

2201
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,719
formal structures

2202
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,640
organizational um setup

2203
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,719
and mechanisms for encouraging the

2204
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,480
sharing of information which i'm really

2205
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,239
interested in but i'm also interested in

2206
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,120
your view on how you see

2207
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,880
informal structures relationships

2208
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,920
because all of this has come down to

2209
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,679
enshrining trust as you say and

2210
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,400
obviously informal structures could have

2211
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,679
a massive role to play in it but

2212
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,600
potentially could be seen as maybe more

2213
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,960
of a hindrance than a help so i'm very

2214
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,719
interested in your views on

2215
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,000
how informal relationships and networks

2216
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,280
can be used

2217
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,360
to help and enshrine information sharing

2218
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
as well as formal ones

2219
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,280
utterly indispensable

2220
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,960
they are one of the most vital aspects

2221
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,480
of collective defense information

2222
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,159
sharing because the structures that i

2223
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,679
mentioned the processes the norms

2224
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,840
they're the precondition the framework

2225
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,600
but the people that i meet here the

2226
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,679
people i know the people i introduce to

2227
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,480
lucy our intel officer for mia or or lj

2228
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,320
our intel officer for aipac

2229
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,440
you know they get to know each other

2230
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,440
they talk they start sharing that's all

2231
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,600
informal you can't mandate that it's

2232
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,120
absolutely indispensable it's one of the

2233
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
most vital aspects of

2234
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,719
of of working together to defend

2235
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,239
ourselves against threats of identifying

2236
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,760
threats of communicating threats i get

2237
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,800
invited

2238
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,719
to sessions because the people who

2239
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,440
invite me they know me and when i'm gone

2240
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,560
they're gonna have to meet the next

2241
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,560
person build that trust with them so so

2242
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,440
yeah

2243
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,520
nothing nothing replaces basically

2244
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,480
meeting people and building

2245
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,120
relationships

2246
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,600
i'll keep it to ten seconds i think all

2247
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,239
right no no i mean more

2248
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,199
not at all um

2249
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,600
good slack channel

2250
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,480
is

2251
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,840
way more important often than any formal

2252
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,719
information sharing setup that exists

2253
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,320
and i think that captures it on the

2254
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,800
importance of informal sharing

2255
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,400
and please please there's something like

2256
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,080
i call portalitis

2257
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,679
in the words of one of our members oh

2258
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,239
god not another portal right just keep

2259
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,799
that in mind

2260
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,840
all right i any more questions uh

2261
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,880
especially on on this side

2262
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,239
it's the quieter side we should make

2263
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,959
sure that they stand up

2264
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,280
right

2265
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,960
so yes

2266
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,040
grab the mic as well please

2267
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:31,920
uh

2268
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,719
i'm orimas caprice from ccdcoe i was in

2269
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,880
communication with john and max

2270
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,040
concerning exercise workshop which we

2271
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,520
had yesterday but

2272
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,280
the concept which i would like to float

2273
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,360
in the air is uh

2274
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,000
outside of the uh exercise concept

2275
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
uh some years ago lithuanian military

2276
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,239
had issue with maintaining proficiency

2277
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,600
of a medical personnel paramedics

2278
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,760
as a military was small and there were

2279
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,440
not so many

2280
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,960
operations ongoing

2281
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,199
so what lithuanian military did

2282
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,040
delegated paramedics

2283
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,719
to er

2284
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,920
or to ambulance services a few days a

2285
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,320
month to maintain their proficiency

2286
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,199
dealing with real life cases

2287
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,400
now

2288
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,760
if we

2289
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,840
think about citizen

2290
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,840
soldier concept but switching tables

2291
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,400
instead of getting citizens into reserve

2292
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,280
units and training them for military

2293
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,520
can we consider sending military

2294
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,719
personnel

2295
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,120
to join the private sector in their

2296
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,639
struggle against

2297
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,840
ongoing attacks every day

2298
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,520
which allow me to

2299
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,679
go forward so i think

2300
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,600
we've seen a number of uh countries

2301
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,280
actually already doing that in in

2302
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,520
variety of forms actually the case study

2303
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,360
that case study the vineyard that i used

2304
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,600
of the dutch cyber command after the

2305
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,960
initial training

2306
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,960
they are placed in the private sector

2307
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,520
for a year um in principle that's that's

2308
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,239
useful um with all the elements to be

2309
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,000
discussed here

2310
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,239
on the differences on both the defensive

2311
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,400
side and the offensive side as to how

2312
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,120
you would go about operating

2313
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,960
there is one key element here however

2314
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,120
that we have to keep in mind in practice

2315
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,199
is that you do then often create cyber

2316
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,040
commands that become the ultimate and

2317
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,880
this is then specifically for cyber ones

2318
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,960
the ultimate recruitment platform

2319
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,880
where it's like fantastic yes send them

2320
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,440
all over and then they can all rotate in

2321
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,920
and out for you know 10 people for a

2322
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,600
year and then by the end of the year

2323
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,400
you've lost your four best people and so

2324
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,679
i'm not saying as a result of it it

2325
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,000
shouldn't be done but again that adds to

2326
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,679
this element particularly when you have

2327
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,840
a command with such a limited mission

2328
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,520
that is already having great

2329
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,280
difficulties of keeping their best

2330
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,320
talent

2331
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,600
to to

2332
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
avoid this form of unlearning and then

2333
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,800
leaving

2334
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,120
i think i think it's a great idea but um

2335
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,480
we see a lot of issues especially in

2336
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,159
eastern european countries

2337
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,639
um where foreign headquartered large

2338
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,000
companies they come in and they pay

2339
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,159
higher salaries than national certs who

2340
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,760
have a lot of very very skilled good

2341
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,040
people and they then lose them to the

2342
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,480
intel teams there

2343
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,480
now uh our american colleagues had a

2344
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,840
very very good approach to this i think

2345
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,600
which is something called called the the

2346
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
nkick i think they're trying to bury the

2347
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,719
name slowly i don't know what it's

2348
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,440
called now the national cyber

2349
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,840
something i have no idea where basically

2350
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,320
you know they just have uh uh analysts

2351
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,920
from for example key ice axe with

2352
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,639
clearance sitting in the same room as us

2353
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,320
cert as which i guess is homeland

2354
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,159
security with fbi and a bunch of others

2355
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:31,840
and just the very fact that one or two

2356
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,600
days a week they sit co-located with

2357
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,679
each other that exchange already takes

2358
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,199
place now not sharing of classified

2359
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,840
information but just knowing each other

2360
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,320
uk with the the ncsc industry 100

2361
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,719
program same thing so in principle is a

2362
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,239
very very good idea if you can sort out

2363
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,920
the logistics and as you say the

2364
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,480
challenges of of not hemorrhaging people

2365
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,000
in the private sector

2366
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,440
it can also be helped if you if you

2367
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,239
build a again the site example of cyber

2368
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,120
reserves if you if you actually uh build

2369
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,159
some sort of a format uh to uh to retain

2370
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,159
that communication within also the

2371
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,400
defense side because in that regard or

2372
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,040
in uh in that case you can also not only

2373
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,800
see that private sector is stealing away

2374
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,840
military experts but also

2375
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,719
having

2376
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,320
cyber security experts in the private

2377
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,000
sector who still have this understanding

2378
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,400
of how the defense sector operates

2379
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,199
so and building a broader societal

2380
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:26,080
base for for defense upon that with the

2381
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,159
caveat that you need to do it in such a

2382
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,480
way that it's both on individual basis

2383
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,800
trust as well as on a structural basis

2384
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,880
organizations not either or

2385
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,800
possible but

2386
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,880
but yeah i mean again if you look at the

2387
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,600
the various like uh reserve formats we

2388
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,760
have estonia has the the cyber defense

2389
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,080
unit latvia has a rather similar one the

2390
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,840
french the uk have built built up

2391
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,679
several or like different approaches to

2392
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,600
that i haven't i'm not aware how

2393
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
efficiently they actually operate all of

2394
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,560
them i know max your you have had like

2395
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,760
you have uh

2396
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,120
looked at some of those examples more

2397
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,199
closely but uh

2398
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,520
but there's a sort of uh also

2399
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,520
organizational innovation taking place

2400
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,840
in in that regard

2401
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,920
yeah no i think reserves can be really

2402
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,239
useful but again there it comes with

2403
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,000
massive caveats as well and let's again

2404
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,520
start with the fundamentals of this

2405
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,480
space

2406
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,880
ultimately cyber operations

2407
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,639
particularly again on the offensive side

2408
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,639
which i've been talking about is about

2409
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,719
understanding the adversaries network

2410
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,760
better than they do themselves

2411
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,840
right it's a famous statement also that

2412
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,000
rob joyce made of the nsa

2413
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,600
if that is the case it isn't possible to

2414
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,840
have this very easy plug-and-play

2415
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,159
solution at a time when you need the

2416
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:44,000
private sector to just say okay we'll

2417
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,239
plug them in and at that time they can

2418
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,639
do whatever they need to do alongside us

2419
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:50,480
next to all the other issues that we

2420
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,920
have seen coming up for a number of

2421
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,920
different countries such as screening

2422
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,360
and rescreening do you need to do this

2423
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,040
again over three years then how does

2424
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,199
this work with clearances and so on but

2425
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,280
it's really the kind of fundamentals

2426
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,120
where you see many of these key issues

2427
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,360
evolve and why i'm i'm skeptical as a

2428
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,159
kind of key solution that some of the

2429
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,000
military organizations thought the

2430
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,440
reserves would be

2431
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,880
yeah it's it can be only as

2432
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,920
supplementary very supplementary but

2433
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,679
definitely not the not the function that

2434
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,719
can be outsourced

2435
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,920
hey so we have one minute left

2436
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,040
and we have one hand off up and

2437
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,199
and the ccdc or his former chief of

2438
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,199
staff is a man that i will

2439
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,880
not deny your question

2440
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,440
actually thank you kadri france london

2441
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,580
no occupation anymore

2442
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:40,500
[Laughter]

2443
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,280
isn't it the core question or the core

2444
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,159
issue

2445
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,960
that we all fight for the same talent

2446
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,320
and which is a very scarce resource

2447
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,679
everywhere

2448
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,080
and therefore we can't

2449
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,840
uh misuse

2450
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,920
the personnel in military or in the

2451
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,440
private sector

2452
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,719
just to do things in their own role but

2453
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,080
to think about

2454
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,520
cooperating as as you said john

2455
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,800
and when it comes to the military

2456
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,920
we often

2457
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,600
tend to

2458
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,960
[Music]

2459
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,400
appoint people

2460
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,520
to a to a specialist function and

2461
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,000
afterwards reappoint it to some

2462
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
something completely different which is

2463
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,040
a waste of of talent and this should be

2464
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,480
avoided uh at all

2465
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,520
i think it's a worthy comment to uh for

2466
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,440
for the like ending of the session as

2467
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,840
well any do you want to reflect on that

2468
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,400
just one closing rock absolutely but

2469
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,000
here's one other fascinating element

2470
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,440
what we have seen particularly with the

2471
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,520
key intelligence agencies in this space

2472
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,600
is that they've also extended the talent

2473
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,760
pool actually some of the best private

2474
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,360
sector talent we see today of course

2475
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,639
come from the nsa or gchq and so on

2476
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,320
and so it's not just oh can they take a

2477
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,840
tell and we're all fighting for it

2478
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,440
they've expanded through long training

2479
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,560
programs and also long-term practice

2480
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,960
this is not something to reiterate the

2481
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,239
point of this presentation that the

2482
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,840
cyber commands have been doing they have

2483
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,080
not expanded the bool of talent they're

2484
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,840
just the way like

2485
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,600
because of the i think limited training

2486
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,440
opportunities that exist today so we

2487
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,840
first have to just really focus on

2488
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,199
training training training which

2489
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,960
requires a great deal of additional

2490
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,880
infrastructure that many of them do not

2491
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,800
have right now

2492
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,560
a bit negative to end here but i think

2493
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,320
that's where it is a simple one of

2494
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,560
extension the talent pool and come come

2495
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,320
talk to me at some point from my from my

2496
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,000
very unfiltered thoughts about what

2497
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,120
industry government and academia are all

2498
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,880
doing horribly horribly wrong in terms

2499
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,760
of expanding the cyber security talent

2500
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,840
and i would also in in response to this

2501
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,239
i would i would just like to you know

2502
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,239
refer to what our colleagues in israel

2503
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,120
do

2504
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,639
you look at the israeli startup sphere

2505
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,600
they're all 8 200 veterans you know i

2506
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,880
think

2507
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,600
really good comment

2508
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,280
lee i think it's your chance to leave

2509
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,960
the last optimistic comment if you if

2510
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,480
you want to after all those depressing

2511
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,080
remarks so

2512
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,360
well

2513
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,440
given the it's two minutes past the

2514
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,360
schedule i'll keep it very short uh i

2515
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,440
