1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,040
so good morning and it is uh fantastic

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
to be here in in tallinn thank you so

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,279
much and uh you know after three years i

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,080
think we all realize just the power of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,400
of again getting together virtual is one

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
thing but true physical presence uh is

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
something that's very special

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
i do want to thank our hosts and most

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
importantly the government of estonia

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
arriving sunday my team and i have

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,519
experienced

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
a very very warm welcome

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
president cars let me also thank you uh

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
thank you for your leadership

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,399
your trip to kyiv in april further

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,120
demonstrated estonia's commitment to

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
ukraine

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
and our nato coalition thank you very

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,040
much sir

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
appropriately

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,719
saikon's theme this year is keep moving

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
over the past 20 years estonia's

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
digitization journey provides an

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
exemplar of the importance of forward

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,120
momentum

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
estonia's unicorn billion dollar tech

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
startups and digital id services set a

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
high bar

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
for the rest of the world to note and

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
strive to achieve

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
yet we also know that as fast as

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
innovation has taken place

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,799
our adversaries have not been far behind

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
this clearly is our collective challenge

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
keep moving

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
gives us a mandate

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
there is no time to waste

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,640
the threat is real

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
persistent and continually changing

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
i just wrapped up a two-day cyber

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
commander's forum here in tallinn where

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
34 nations discussed the most important

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
aspect of our cyber capabilities

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
our people

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
and what a timely discussion

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
all of us need to have the right

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
workforce in place for the challenges

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
ahead

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,079
so that we can

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
keep moving

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,759
collectively we have seen these

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,719
challenges cyberspace has created a new

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
strategic environment which cyber actors

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
can increase their power degrade the

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,000
power of others

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
and gain strategic advantage

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,318
our adversaries are targeting our

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,318
economy our critical infrastructure and

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
our electoral processes

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
in 2022 adversaries look for

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
opportunities

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
to steal defense secrets

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
intellectual property and personally

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,000
identifiable information to conduct

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
malicious cyber campaigns to attempt to

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
erode our military advantage

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
and leverage social media platforms to

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,160
carry out influence operations

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
it's instructive perhaps to recall the

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
journey that we've been on in cyberspace

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
20 years ago in the wake of 9 11 we

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
didn't think much about a cyber threat

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
back then we were not as connected as we

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
are now

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,239
we had flip phones

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,040
and the most popular social media sites

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,640
myspace and classmates.com

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
facebook twitter instagram snapchat none

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
of these were in use at that time or

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,400
even invented

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
but the times have changed the global

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,920
digital footprint has grown

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
exponentially

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
not only due to advancements in

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
technology but also because of our

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,159
increasing

87
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
reliance

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
on technology in our personal and

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
professional lives

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
never has this been more evident than

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
over the past two years

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
when the world was forced to adapt to a

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
new disruptive force

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
coven

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
today we're not just connected to our

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,560
phones and social media but our lives

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
are increasingly driven by technology

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
classes are online are online as are

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
conferences doctors appointments and

100
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,720
banking

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
each one of these services while

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,840
convenient

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
presents a potential vulnerability that

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
adverse adversaries can exploit

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
2021 was a pivotal year for the united

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
states in cyberspace we began the year

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
with solar winds followed quickly by

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,760
microsoft hafnium

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
by the spring the ransomware attack

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
against colonial pipeline threaten the

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
fuel supply on the east coast

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
we then experienced tax against jbs and

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
cassaya before the challenge of log 4j

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
vulnerabilities closed out the year

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
quite simply the scope scale and

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
sophistication of these events were

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,720
unlikely ever experienced before

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
this wasn't a result of

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
phishing or an exploitation of poor

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
passwords

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
these were ransomware attacks zero days

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
and our adversaries embedding themselves

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
in our supply chain

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
the colonial pipeline attack in

125
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
particular gave us a glimpse

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
of how adversaries can cause physical

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
damage

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
while operating in the virtual world

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
and brought to light

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
the real potential of this threat

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
today i offer

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
cyber security is national security

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
and the events of 2021 certainly

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
underscore this

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,199
as u.s cyber command on the national

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,840
security agency we remain engaged

137
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,240
relevant and focused on cyber security

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
let's baseline

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
the missions and actions of both the

140
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,639
command and the agency at u.s cyber

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,240
command three missions first of all

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
defend the dod department of defense

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
information network 15 000 classified

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
and unclassified networks the dot mil

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
protecting our weapon systems our data

146
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
and our networks

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
four million endpoints 3.5 million users

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
600 000 mobile subscribers

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
it's also defending the nation from

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
cyber attack working with the department

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
of homeland security and the federal

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,680
bureau of investigation in a cooperation

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
that ensures our nation is secure in

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
cyberspace

155
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
and finally support to the joint force

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
support to our combatant commanders like

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
u.s european command with offensive and

158
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
defensive cyber operations and

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,840
information

160
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,360
operations at the national security two

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,400
missions

162
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,479
first of all signals intelligence we

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
develop deep insights in our adversaries

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,639
to provide the nation information

165
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,520
advantage in competition crisis or

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
conflict

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
cyber security

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
we prevent and eradicate cyber threats

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
to us national security systems and

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
critical infrastructure focused

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,039
initially and most importantly on the

172
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
defense industrial base

173
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
in the improvement of our weapons

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
security

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
so what have we done

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
well i begin with persistent engagement

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
2018 a watershed year for u.s cyber

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
command as we introduced and executed

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
persistent engagement

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
this concept nested within the

181
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
department of defense's defend forward

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
strategy

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,639
reoriented the approach to cyber defense

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,319
we would actively

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
engage adversaries outside of our

186
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
nation's borders

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
before they could do us harm

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
under persistent engagement we both

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
enable and end and act enable our

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
partners with information and act when

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
authorized against our adversaries

192
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
with this change in our approach your

193
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
cybercram became engaged with

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
adversaries on a daily basis in

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
cyberspace

196
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,039
one methodology we employ

197
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
is hunt forward operations

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
we deploy defensive cyber teams around

199
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,639
the world to hunt for adversaries

200
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
activity before it reaches the united

201
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
states an important aspect of

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,759
international collaboration and

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
partnership

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,560
over 27 deployments to 16 nations

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,520
and 50 different disparate networks

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
all in the course of four years

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
here insight is a meeting and shared

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,639
with our partner nations collectively we

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,919
are both defended against the

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
adversary's latest techniques and

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
tactics

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
we stop adversary malware at their

213
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,280
initial point of use

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
importantly

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
this is where public-private

216
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
partnerships come in sharing the latest

217
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
indicators of compromise at the

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
unclassified level allowing a consortium

219
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
of cyber security providers to develop

220
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,800
signatures

221
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
and inoculate

222
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
all of us to the malware

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
secondly it's really been building

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
strong partnerships in a series of

225
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
operations over the past five years u.s

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,120
cyber command and the national security

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
agency have developed strong

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
partnerships with interagency

229
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
intelligence community international

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
partners industry and academia

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
all built on outcomes against a variety

232
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
of threats to our nation

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
the strongest partnership begins with u

234
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,680
s cyber command and the national

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,479
security agency operating together

236
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
with unique authorities capabilities and

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,719
talents we have demonstrated speed

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
agility and unity of effort

239
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
the list of operations that build strong

240
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
partnerships includes

241
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
joint task force aries

242
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,519
it's also though

266
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,839
operating transparently and sharing

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,279
awareness

268
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
to operate with a broader range of

269
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
partners both u.s cyber command and the

270
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,399
national security agency realized we

271
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,480
needed to move from a near total

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
reliance on classified information to

273
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,480
venues

274
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
where information could be shared

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
readily rapidly

276
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
in an unclassified medium

277
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
the resulting work has reshaped our

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
command and agency

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,959
in 2018 in partnership with the maryland

282
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
unclassified facility where we can work

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,399
with partners across academia industry

284
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
and the broader us government to

285
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
innovate on tough cyber problems and

286
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,440
improve our collective defense

287
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
this venue has enabled industry to focus

288
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
on our priority challenges ensured rapid

289
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
sharing of threats and indicators of

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
malicious cyber activity

291
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
and educated a broad segment of high

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
school college and graduate students on

293
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
u.s cyber command's roles and

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,279
responsibilities with an eye to develop

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
the next generation

296
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
of cyber talent

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
in 2019 the national security agency

298
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,279
established a cyber security director to

299
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,240
both prevent and eradicate

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
threats with a focus on our national

301
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
security systems and the defense

302
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
industrial base

303
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,279
one year later we cut the ribbon on a

304
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
cyber security collaboration center

305
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
that operates with a broad swath of

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
industry partners at the unclassified

307
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
level the power of operating at an

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
unclassified medium has resulted in the

309
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
public release

310
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
of 61 cyber security advisories 12 alone

311
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
in 2022

312
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
that have identified unique malware

313
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
tips to secure telecom telework networks

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
prioritized network security information

315
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,519
to assist security administrators

316
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
and protection against russian attacks

317
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,800
on satellite networks

318
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
as we think about shared awareness

319
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,399
in the midst of the recent russian

320
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
ukraine crisis and the subsequent

321
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,079
unlawful and brutal invasion

322
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
we have also demonstrated the power of

323
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
sharing information and awareness

324
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
this information has proven to be

325
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,040
accurate

326
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
timely and actionable

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
resulting in powerful outcomes

328
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
outcomes that include building a

329
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
coalition of like-minded nations

330
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
exposing russian malign activities and

331
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
information operations

332
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
and key reads to partners

333
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
that enable their security

334
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
as we think of scicoms theme keep moving

335
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
how do we apply this

336
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
to what we've learned at u.s cyber

337
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
command and the national security agency

338
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,560
first

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
we consider our operations on a

340
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
continuum of action

341
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
in both our strategic environment and in

342
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
cyberspace we find ourselves somewhere

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
in competition crisis or conflict it is

344
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
no longer the binary approach of simple

345
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
peace or war

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,959
rather our goal is to stay in

347
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,600
competition but we must be prepared to

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
transition

349
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,040
rapidly to either crisis or conflict

350
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
importantly

351
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
we develop our operations ready made for

352
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,000
competition with a strong focus on

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
indicators that may require us to

354
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,519
prepare for a crisis or even a conflict

355
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,560
second

356
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
we seek agility in what we do

357
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
the world in which we live today

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
requires us to address a multitude of

359
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
threats we will remain relevant

360
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
only as long as we continue to operate

361
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,279
globally

362
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,120
and bring our elements of national power

363
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
more quickly to bear

364
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
than our adversaries

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
today's environment is different from

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,200
the one we faced in the post-9 11 days

367
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
and requires a level of vigilance and

368
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
preparation against nation state

369
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
and trans boundary threats

370
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
how do we achieve agility

371
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
first through partnerships

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
we seek partnerships that provide our

373
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
command and agency a broader

374
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
understanding of the environment

375
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,680
capabilities are capacities

376
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,240
that empower our operations or position

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
ourselves uniquely for the future

378
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
second through competitive advantage

379
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
these are qualities that separate us

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
from our adversaries whether this is our

381
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,639
talent

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
our ability to make or break code our

383
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
planning capacity to synchronize

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
operations or our threat intelligence

385
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
each provides a degree of agility that

386
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,519
empowers our actions

387
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
and finally

388
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
technology

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,320
establishing an enduring advantage will

390
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
include our technological capabilities

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
whether this is artificial intelligence

392
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
big data cloud computing or other areas

393
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
advancement we are a command and agency

394
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
built for technology

395
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
ready to leverage its power

396
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,800
and apply it wisely to our operations

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
finally

398
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
we've learned over the years that

399
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
partnership

400
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
just as it improves our agility

401
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
is a fundamental requirement to our

402
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
success

403
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
neither u.s cyber command nor the

404
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
national security agency has all the

405
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
authorities capabilities talent or

406
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,120
insights

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
to operate apart

408
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,839
and be successful in this domain

409
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,199
rather

410
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
we understand that partnerships provide

411
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
ourselves and our allies a powerful

412
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
advantage

413
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
as we have seen so readily in the russia

414
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
ukraine crisis democratic nations

415
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
establish rich

416
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
robust partnerships

417
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,560
autocratic nations

418
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
rely on clients

419
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
the difference is marked

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,600
recognizable and an asset to ourselves

421
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,160
and our allies and partners

422
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,639
so as we move forward today as we keep

423
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
moving let me offer

424
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
we must all think differently about

425
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
cyberspace and the strategic environment

426
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
going forward

427
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
cyber security is national security

428
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
saikon has aptly highlighted keep moving

429
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,959
as this year's theme perhaps most

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,240
important

431
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
is that we keep moving

432
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
forward together

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
our collective power is in our

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
partnerships we have demonstrated this

435
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
clearly when working together we can

436
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,880
address

437
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
our most pressing challenges our most

438
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,199
significant threats

439
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,040
at u.s cyber command and the national

440
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
security agency

441
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
we look forward to keep moving

442
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,680
particularly in partnership with many of

443
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
you

444
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
thank you for your time and attention

445
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,720
have a great conference
