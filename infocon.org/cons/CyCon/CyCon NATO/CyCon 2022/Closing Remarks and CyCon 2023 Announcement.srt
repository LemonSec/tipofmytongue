1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
very impressive we're we're almost there

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,080
almost in the end and i see almost no

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,680
casualties from last night we are

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,759
avengers great great determination

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
i found myself thinking how cool it is

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,759
to have a cyber conference in estonia it

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,119
is the final minutes of the conference

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,560
and we still are having a former

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
president in the audience uh this this

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
is uh

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,800
very very good for this conference and

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,720
it made me think i need to tell a bit of

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,880
script and talk about the roots of

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
estonian digital story all the estonians

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
know it we know the tiger leap

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
perhaps the

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
visitors don't know it

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
now in the early 90s estonia had just

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
broken free from soviet union

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
economy was devastated from 50 years of

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
occupation

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,760
um

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
everybody was screaming at the

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,039
government we need for funding you know

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
for retirees pensions for child support

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
everybody wanted something everybody was

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
discussing how can we catch up with the

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
rest of the world how can we catch up

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
and then we had a group of three

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,800
visionaries

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
who decided that catching up is the

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
wrong question to ask how can we get

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,159
ahead

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,479
and they pushed for a program

35
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,560
that became known as the tiger's leap

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
and the government

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
signed on to it and we financed

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,640
computerizing schools started teaching

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
coding in schools

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
probably that's why we're having this

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
conference

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
probably that's why estonia is a

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
digitally advanced nation

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
without tiger's leap

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
perhaps estonia right now might be known

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
for its

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
potatoes

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680

[Applause]

now sometimes the final speaker is

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
expected to sum up the conference uh

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,000

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360

change the paradigm shift uh

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
i'm hoping that next year's reality will

be that

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,720

war is over and we're analyzing the

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
aftermath of the war where cyber played

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
a big part

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
