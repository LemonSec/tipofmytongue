1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,800
so um

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,919
first of all

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,000
i'm very humbled to stand in front of

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,279
you

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,759
in my

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,639
life i've done simple things like

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,559
building spacecraft developing

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,920
intelligent weapon systems and

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,279
autonomous vehicles for off-road

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,480
conditions

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
and i have always known that everything

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,640
we do is enabled by cyber security

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
because no one would trust these things

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
if we can't be sure that say

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,440
the control of the systems will be

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,920
maintained by human operators thank you

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,120
so um

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,360
in this presentation i would like to

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
share with you the main

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
challenges

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,200
hopes of

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
developers of

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
intelligent weapon systems to support

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
our infantry uh for on ground operation

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
theater

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,079
and

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
bring out some elements there which are

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
mostly dependent on cyber aspects

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,760
so uh maybe starting from general

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
background on technology trends and

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,560
developments who is pointing out how it

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,040
links to the work we do today on

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
development of intelligent

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
ground robotic systems

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,880
then talking about the standardized

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,119
approach towards the future

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,799
our efforts for europe to develop our

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
standard architecture for unmanned crown

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
vehicle-based systems and

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
then

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,320
i will also show you a lot of videos so

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
you would not fall asleep

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,439
and maybe this is exactly a good time to

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,720
start with one so that would will be on

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,799
the same page in understanding what i am

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,920
talking about what kind of systems

47
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:16,720
[Music]

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,030
[Applause]

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,090
[Applause]

50
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,630
[Music]

51
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,930
[Applause]

52
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,860
[Music]

53
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,330
[Music]

54
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,870
[Music]

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
so about this video i have to apologize

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
to my friends our friends at the patria

57
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,319
it's a famous finnish defense company

58
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
because they got very mad at looking

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
when looking at this video because that

60
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
was their apc shot did by planks and all

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
the smoke around it so as i said fitting

62
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
cal would not shoot through our armor

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
sorry

64
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,319
undexy

65
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,599
so um

66
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
with our good partners from different uh

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
different

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
nato allies we have put together

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,959
different

70
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
systems like that both to support for

71
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,120
dismounted infantry on and also for a

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
cooperation with mechanized infantry at

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
high speeds

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
so uh but before we go into more detail

75
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
about this development uh just to

76
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
rephrase your memory

77
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
just to remind you about the most

78
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,040
relevant reference book in nato nowadays

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
which is

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
the science and technology trends 2020

81
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
2040 document developed by nato science

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
and technology organization

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
and we all know in this hall what the

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
future will bring we know that trends we

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
know

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
say as a baseline

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
of

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
things that establish these trends but

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
when you want to know what nato has

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
agreed upon sen's approach is described

91
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
in this document i'm pretty sure all of

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
you have read it but now when we look at

93
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
uh unknown crown systems for example

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
then the future is now

95
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
today now it's only 2020 at

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
22 and we already developed systems that

97
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
you saw in the video before that well

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,919
sure t chi-chi cell but also distributed

99
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
and uh well i strongly believe that the

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
main battle tank is history as we see

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
evidence rising also from russian war on

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,479
ukraine

103
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
and we believe that that kind of

104
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
distributed

105
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,840
smaller

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
more mobile less protected

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
robotic systems will

108
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
be the future of the battlefield but in

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
order to be distributed surely they have

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
to be interconnected and we see that

111
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
through

112
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,320
flexible use of different

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
radio channels like tactical

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
communication different satellite

115
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
communication channels including

116
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
starlink and then using different

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
frequencies going to very high

118
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,080
frequencies which would not travel far

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
in atmosphere but on the other hand it

120
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
would be very difficult to jam as slow

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
at the lower

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
shorter distances we see this

123
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
interconnected

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,680
happening soon and intelligent from the

125
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
point of view that

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
point of view of ground systems so um we

127
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,960
will surely have a time delays in

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
communication and we surely have

129
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
communication jamming and

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,240
and break breakdown of communication so

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
from our point of view intelligence at

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
the platform level uh should maintain

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
the operation of the system even if the

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
communication is lost and i think

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
parallel could be brought from simply

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
infantry

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
soldier in comparison with a special

138
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
special

139
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,919
branch soldier so simple infantry still

140
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,880
needs uh to be close to his sergeant and

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,759
get

142
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,680
commands on regular basis while

143
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
operation branch soldier could maybe

144
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,800
operate for weeks and as intelligent

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
knowledge and training to

146
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
make a lot of independent decisions well

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
that very nicely alliance with when we

148
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
analyze what is the capability of our

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
current robotic assets so based on these

150
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
trends nato listed us a set of

151
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,479
set of technology

152
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
technologies that will shape the

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
battlefield most during the next 18

154
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
years

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,280
and

156
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,520
we are very much linked in this

157
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
discussion with autonomous systems

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,599
artificial intelligence and

159
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,960
big data so

160
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
we have a lot of legal and experts in

161
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,360
the whole and

162
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
and a lot of technical experts here so i

163
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
was proud to be a committee put together

164
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,479
by ieee

165
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,160
two years ago which analyzed

166
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
what kind of support ieee could provide

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
to

168
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,759
developers or

169
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
procurement agencies or users of

170
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
autonomous weapon systems of the future

171
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
so this is a public document you can

172
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
find it online we put together

173
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
well first we

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
analyzed the task we were given and we

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
came to conclusions that within a two

176
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,080
years perspective that we had ahead of

177
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,479
us we can't solve any of these questions

178
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,720
what we can do is to list the questions

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
so

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
this report is about questions and this

181
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,960
is just a

182
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
table of contents these are the titles

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
and all the questions are under these

184
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
titles different categories

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
unfortunately you cannot see cyber

186
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
security and cyber defense here as a

187
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
main title

188
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
well if i would have had position i will

189
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
have starting from august then i would

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
have made sure that cyber defense

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,120
especially cooperative cyber defense

192
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,599
would have been one of one of the titles

193
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,320
there but well currently it's underlying

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
and in very different

195
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
different roles throughout this uh this

196
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
list of challenges and questions that

197
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
needs to be answered before we can

198
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
deploy

199
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
weapon systems with significant

200
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
intelligence and

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
autonomous functions

202
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
so

203
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
now i apologize for for all legal

204
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
experts in the whole but from my simple

205
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,720
engineering perspective as a company rep

206
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
i would say that when we see as a

207
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
question what is legal and ethical in

208
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
autonomous system site today

209
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
then we can say probably that sort of

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
think about the vehicle you saw in the

211
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
forest in the first video so there are

212
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
some things that are clearly legal and

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
ethical for example human in the loop

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
full remote control

215
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,720
shooting enemy tank

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
or then there are some things that are

217
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,360
clearly legal and unethical for example

218
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
as the same vehicle program to

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,480
run around downtown tallinn and

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
kill all civilians

221
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
close children's

222
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
it can see

223
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
so and a lot of uh on clarity in between

224
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,839
being debated from industry perspective

225
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
it would be extremely important to draw

226
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,279
the line because our investments and

227
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
business decisions depend on that

228
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
heavily so

229
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
it's important for blue yeah janna very

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
nicely described much more

231
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,320
professionally she's pretty much the

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,519
same question

233
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
i don't believe that putin can be uh can

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,839
be trusted on saying anything on

235
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,399
uh

236
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
on the behavior of

237
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
of his nation but

238
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
what we will do is to stick to our

239
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
values and principles and if we have

240
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
agreed on the line we will most likely

241
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,120
maintain it i'm pre i believe that so on

242
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
red side if of course it would be much

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
more wise to

244
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,760
prohibit everything they can allow as

245
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
little as possible and extend the gray

246
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
zone as well because they don't care

247
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
anyways that makes a difference between

248
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,880
the blue and the red

249
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,959
so in different working groups

250
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,200
in nato industrial advisory group and

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
nato advisory group on emerging and

252
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
disruptive technologies we have analyzed

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
what nato can do

254
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,079
to be to maintain the lead in this

255
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
technological

256
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,600
technological race

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,560
and um i just picked some of the

258
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
recommendations from these groups that

259
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,959
might be relevant to this audience as

260
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
well and

261
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,000
first and foremost there is a some

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
people might be afraid that countries

263
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
like china for example they have this

264
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
enormous

265
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
capability to focus resources on key

266
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
technologies

267
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
but we believe that nato which is

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
diverse

269
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
one could say it's weak because

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
resources are scattered but the suicidal

271
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
analysis our working group agrees that

272
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
actually as

273
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
national

274
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
natural diversity is a baseline for

275
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,320
evolution so is diversity in business

276
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
and academia it is a baseline for

277
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
innovation and that's a number one

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
strength for nato as a huge diverse

279
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,320
organization

280
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
and we only need to turn this into our

281
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
strengths that means

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
pick up this innovation fruits of

283
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
innovation and turn them into mature

284
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
systems defending our nations and for

285
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,480
that

286
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
we emphasized three key elements

287
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,320
open architectures interoperability and

288
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
modularity of the system and while

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
interoperability for example has been

290
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
started forever in nato it's very

291
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
important stuff but we also emphasize

292
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,959
that in the future this ai based uh for

293
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
example battlefield management systems

294
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,519
and

295
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
and autonomous weapon system might

296
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,399
become so complicated that it's almost

297
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,040
impossible for a single company to

298
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
develop the best in the world solution

299
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
most likely we see modularity of modular

300
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
architectures that would enable

301
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
different stakeholders from different

302
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
different nations to contribute into

303
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
these systems for example the vehicle

304
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
that you saw in the forest

305
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,320
it had of course very simple level uh

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
weapons from

307
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
lockheed martin right there on

308
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
gongsberry and uh and vehicle itself

309
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,560
from milgram and so on so on but on

310
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
autonomous side we're developing this

311
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
kind of standardized autonomous

312
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
navigation kit architecture in one

313
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
european project dimension later that

314
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,519
allows different companies startups who

315
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
develop a intelligent navigation

316
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,079
functionality for that type of

317
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,279
environment to be plugged in to this

318
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,880
this backbone to enable more efficient

319
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
more efficient intelligent navigation

320
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
kit for the system very important that

321
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
has been also mentioned here before

322
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,279
today is

323
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
actually the education training of the

324
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,680
military personnel and

325
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
our commission committee in this uh this

326
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,440
is one of the groups puts this first

327
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
because

328
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,959
well

329
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,760
as point three says technological

330
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,839
innovation is nothing without doctrinal

331
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,760
innovation if we talk about disruptive

332
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
innovation so so technologies that will

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
really transform the way we fight our

334
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
wars that means if we fight its own way

335
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,760
with new technology it's almost useless

336
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
so our officers should be trained

337
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
to to understand the capabilities the

338
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
new technology will provide them in the

339
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,279
future distant future even if this

340
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
technology doesn't really exist yet

341
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
which means actually coming to the

342
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,600
point that means that industry and and

343
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,839
military stakeholders have to start

344
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
cooperating much in much earlier stages

345
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
when the idea is porns and academia

346
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
industry and military stakeholders have

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,560
to come together to figure out how in 10

348
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
years when this technology will be

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
eventually mature

350
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
by that time our toxins would be adopted

351
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
already to this new capability

352
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,839
and

353
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,079
0.6 i would emphasize um it was

354
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,880
mentioned here as well so uh how do we

355
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
get to all these different nations and

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
even more importantly one billion nato

357
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
citizens with the message that we have

358
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
and one thing

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,839
that we thought was that well it's very

360
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
easy to say that well this industry they

361
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,279
are

362
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
killer robot developers they should be

363
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
prohibited and nato well they accept

364
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
killer robots so they are bad and why we

365
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
leave that kind of discussion uh to be

366
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,920
initiated and initiative in the hand of

367
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
those who would like to

368
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
maybe not being very technically correct

369
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
uh to prohibit everything that could be

370
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,079
of help to our defense so we very

371
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
strongly

372
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
suggested that nato should takes a lead

373
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
takes an initiative in

374
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,519
open

375
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,160
transparent discussion which very nicely

376
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,440
was mentioned by joanna as well exactly

377
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
on autonomous

378
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
robotic side it's very much applicable

379
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
and that would

380
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
i have never thought about it before

381
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,839
like you said but you said that it also

382
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,000
has very strong implications to the

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,120
other nations in between so i think they

384
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
are afraid of killer robots as well

385
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
so uh now talking about how this

386
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
development has been ongoing with

387
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
related infantry supporting support

388
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,839
systems based on that type of vehicles

389
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,079
well just now a little bit about the

390
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,759
technology here is um example of

391
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,800
now a photo is being taken

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,920
thank you

393
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,680
sorry guys

394
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,279
well i need that i need to give you a

395
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
treat as well because i was making a

396
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,160
joke i know you uh you all envy me

397
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,800
because you still have to be sitting and

398
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
i could come out and do some exercises

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
so please guys everybody stand up and

400
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
look around one shoulder look around the

401
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,680
advanced shoulder and feel refreshed for

402
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
a moment and once more situational

403
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
awareness every soldier needs to know

404
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,280
what's behind him or her

405
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
and now you are allowed to sit back

406
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,400
i hope you feel better

407
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
so with this modular systems

408
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
what we propose the future battlefield

409
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,959
will look like is a combination of this

410
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,079
modular

411
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,039
uh mobility capability combined with

412
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,559
different payloads different weapon

413
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,440
systems uxv based systems drones and

414
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
ground assets that would actually meet

415
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
exactly the criteria that nato

416
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
scientists have predicted intelligent

417
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
interconnected distributed digital and

418
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
in all that you now coming back to the

419
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
statements that we need to be ready for

420
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
the future

421
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
now the process that would be bring

422
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,840
together technology awareness and

423
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,360
military

424
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
thinking and military science

425
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,080
we come to the tactical and doctoral

426
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
innovations through concept development

427
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
and experimentation so how these systems

428
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
are used on the battlefield so at milram

429
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
my responsibility as science and

430
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,440
development director most importantly is

431
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
to work with stakeholders to analyze

432
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
stakeholder needs i don't even go to

433
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
stakeholder requirements level

434
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
because what we see is most important is

435
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
to work together with military

436
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,480
stakeholders to understand how sys

437
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,559
technology will reform the battlefield

438
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,880
and we use this kind of classical

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
process in this analysis first we look

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,600
at the conceptual frameworks how

441
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,320
what we are going to achieve in our

442
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
warfighting for example breaking

443
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
deliberate defense then we list most

444
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
relevant operation concepts that we we

445
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
need to this we have described in a

446
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
report uh for example

447
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
how uxv

448
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,039
uxs enables operations in urban area

449
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,480
like uh

450
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
uxs enable enhance situational awareness

451
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
enabled uh spare head cutting dispersal

452
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
adversary lines of communications and so

453
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
on and then we adapt this to some

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
certain scenario and we turn it into

455
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,679
concept of operation and then we split

456
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,600
it back again into

457
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
a huge list of user stories and use

458
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
cases which are based on

459
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
soldiers view team view section view

460
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,160
platoon view company view battalion view

461
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,360
and so on and from another side all that

462
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,880
again will be divided into larger

463
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
battlefield functions like

464
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
effect on logistics on protection and

465
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,400
sustainability

466
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
on engagement mobility command and

467
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
control intelligence readiness

468
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,280
deployment

469
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
and all that goes into use cases and now

470
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
this analysis which we can't do alone

471
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
since we do together with our friendly

472
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,360
armed forces

473
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
personnel

474
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,360
we

475
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
come to the

476
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
set of stakeholder needs that will

477
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
define our requirements eventually for

478
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,880
our infantry support systems which basic

479
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,360
architecture is that it consists of the

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
vehicle platform vehicle smart mobility

481
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
solution payload on top of it

482
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,159
communication solution which has to be

483
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
very very capable and command and

484
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
control solution which would be linked

485
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
into larger battlefield management

486
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
system eventually

487
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,520
so

488
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,360
how we do it

489
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
this cooperative

490
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
concept development and experimentation

491
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,360
actually we thank nato act we are very

492
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
we very very much appreciate nato sat

493
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
being

494
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,679
having been developed the

495
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,799
cdnd handbook which describes a

496
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
standardized procedure how

497
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
to analyze if we have new technology or

498
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
capability cap in our our capability

499
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
for our national defense and

500
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
how this new technology can solve this

501
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,159
capability cap

502
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
using this standardized procedure

503
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,640
companies like us working together with

504
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
stakeholders from

505
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
from armed forces we basically can

506
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,760
provide two types of supports

507
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
and i'm sorry i have to say that this is

508
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
it's not sales pitch don't come and buy

509
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,159
the service from milram i'm talking

510
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,919
about the principles how we should

511
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,600
cooperate in detail

512
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
whatever company we talk about

513
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,960
so uh

514
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
companies like

515
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
says industry can provide armed forces

516
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,679
with

517
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
technical support for example putting

518
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,640
together a uxv based system who is from

519
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,159
many different companies and actually

520
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
i'm telling you the story of italy italy

521
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,039
started did a procurement last year and

522
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,080
they established five years process to

523
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,559
find answer to a question how

524
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
uxv-based systems would transform urban

525
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,799
warfare during next five to 15 years and

526
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
milram is proud to be now industry

527
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,559
partner together with a

528
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
large consortium of uav and uxv develop

529
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
utv developers supporting now italian

530
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
armed forces to find solutions to that

531
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
question based on act

532
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
cd and the

533
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
handbook procedure

534
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
and by providing technical support with

535
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,600
all the technology and providing then

536
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
also methodological support to the

537
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,640
officers of the uh

538
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,799
of the headquarters

539
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,520
so uh here is a video demonstrating what

540
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
it actually means because when we use a

541
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,080
theory part first then we need to we

542
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
need to go to the battlefield and

543
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,559
experiment how it works

544
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
i have two examples two videos first one

545
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,360
is

546
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
in cooperation with estonia uh one of

547
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
the estonian artillery battalions and as

548
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,720
a

549
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
it was live firing exercise and the

550
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,600
questions officers asked was how that

551
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,240
type of robotics could support uh

552
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,320
operations of a battalion

553
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
artillery battalion here our system is

554
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,600
in two functions first uh one vehicle

555
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,960
who is

556
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,120
with kinectic payload is supporting

557
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,840
forward-positioned infantry squad both

558
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
for giving suppressive and cover fire

559
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,440
and also helping to increase mobility of

560
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,200
infantry by uh

561
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,840
by helping to uh to carry their heavy

562
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
gear and the second unit it helps to uh

563
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,010
helps in targeting who is a testosterone

564
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:32,260

[Music]

569
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,080
so

570
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:13,269
[Music]

571
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,600
multi-functional combat and combat

service support

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,799
so

574
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,039
that was now one example from uh in

575
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,640
cooperation with estonian armed forces

576
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
the next video is in cooperation with

577
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,679
slavian armed forces

578
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,039
slightly different scenario

583
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:55,599
[Music]

584
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:15,440
[Music]

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:28,220
[Music]

586
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,279
so

587
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,200
we said

588
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
we have come to a more systematic view

589
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,640
on this infantry system and uh

590
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,520
european defense fund has uh initiated

591
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,000
one of the one of its projects is about

592
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
unmanned ground systems milgram robotics

593
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,120
is very proud to lead the project and we

594
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,279
have a lot of very honored partners and

595
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,640
i'm pretty sure a lot of people from

596
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,279
these companies are in the uh audience

597
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,720
today as well

598
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,200
so the idea is now to establish as

599
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
european

600
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
basic architecture was our type of

601
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,440
systems and different elements of

602
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,399
architecture or and the project are

603
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,639
integration with different payloads

604
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,919
swarming and cooperative behavior of

605
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,880
different assets operation scenarios for

606
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,279
uh with manned and unmanned assets

607
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,919
cooperation a new artificial

608
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
intelligence-based navigation solutions

609
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,880
for the systems

610
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,200
integrated communication solution based

611
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,919
on different available assets

612
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,080
and

613
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
control command and control of the

614
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,320
system with the capabilities

615
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,240
and last but not least development of

616
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
cyber defense system for that

617
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
architecture

618
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
and with cyber defense which also is uh

619
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,039
led by estonian company tolkien

620
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,080
since

621
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
this architecture or this cyber the

622
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,120
challenges here are that well if we have

623
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
this

624
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,799
quite large system and many components

625
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
from different providers so cyber

626
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,120
challenges start already from

627
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,840
controlling the supply chain and since

628
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,120
they continue by physical

629
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,159
tempering with with a part of the

630
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
systems and

631
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,919
intrusion from different different

632
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,080
entry points to the system and so on so

633
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
on and what will happen if

634
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
enemy captures some of the vehicles how

635
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
should we respond so

636
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,760
so detection and response to cyber

637
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
attacks is the main focus of this

638
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,039
research so the city and the effort it's

639
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,279
extensive together with very many

640
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,279
different nations uk us netherlands

641
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,320
italy estonia and so on so on so um

642
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,799
to conclude this discussion is that uh

643
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
of course we have been speaking about

644
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,919
dual use

645
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,799
and from industry perspective a company

646
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
like uh like sat uh has actually much

647
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
larger potential in civilian sector and

648
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
we are looking a couple of uh

649
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,039
opportunities for example forest

650
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,039
regeneration solution based on robotics

651
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,760
so planting the trees and doing

652
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
maintenance during first five years and

653
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
you know nobody it's not it's well it's

654
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,080
not well automated uh today or

655
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,159
mechanized today it's not automated at

656
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,880
all it's all it's very badly mechanized

657
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
not very efficiently and it's extremely

658
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,399
difficult to wind to find people who are

659
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,960
willing to work with

660
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
uses

661
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
simple workings in the brush with all

662
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
these mosquitoes around so our robots

663
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,720
don't complain and that we see as a

664
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
great potential for this

665
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,039
cooperation but now i show you a video

666
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,760
of

667
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
how our robots

668
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
cleaned streets in thailand

669
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,399
when we had lost snow but now keep in

670
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,399
mind would that

671
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,720
vehicle be at weapon

672
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,159
in the hands of attackers

673
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,410
[Music]

674
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,740
[Music]

675
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:33,279
[Music]

676
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,489
[Music]

677
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,720
[Music]

678
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,880
so regardless

679
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
of us talking uh from about military

680
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
applications or civilian applications

681
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
definitely we see that

682
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,799
proper cyber security solutions

683
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,720
are the key or

684
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,039
one of the most important enablers

685
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,120
before they will be

686
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,159
used actively and this is something that

687
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,799
our customers also ask all the time what

688
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,640
about cyber security actually the second

689
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,240
thing they ask is what about radio

690
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,120
connection but we have answers there for

691
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
questions about cyber security i hope

692
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,919
you guys help us to answer all the

693
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,279
questions

694
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,600
and at the same time we try to be very

695
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,480
transparent about our ethical principles

696
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,120
and i think every company dealing with

697
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,159
intelligent weapon systems has to pay a

698
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,760
lot of attention to be proactive and

699
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
first not to just react to the questions

700
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,480
about your legal and more or less

701
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,399
profile but

702
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,200
very well very clearly define what is

703
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,080
okay for us and what is not so we

704
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
developed took some time developed our

705
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
policy of ethical development on systems

706
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,880
with intelligent functions we based it

707
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,840
on

708
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,360
european uh principles and this is what

709
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,600
we came up with

710
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
now we don't know what the future will

711
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
bring

712
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
everybody who has uh played uh ubisoft's

713
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
costly complete point

714
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
war game say you might recognize uh

715
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
sorry it was a nice press release in in

716
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,120
france that uh ubisoft a french company

717
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,440
say yes say described in their press

718
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,960
release when they released these new

719
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,120
games that they went into uh wanted to

720
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
know how the future battlefield look

721
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,039
like and they approached the french

722
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,360
ministry of defense with the question

723
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,039
and they were recommended to come to

724
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,279
tallinn and talk to milram so a couple

725
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,200
of years ago we had very nice meeting

726
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,519
with stan software the designers from

727
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,320
game designers from ubisoft to describe

728
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,840
how the future battlefield would look

729
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,679
like and this is what they come up with

730
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,720
as a game up with based on our teams

731
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
well it looks looks like a killer robot

732
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
to me so

733
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,880
maybe this picture is more peaceful as a

734
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,320
final slide of my presentation so we are

735
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,879
very proud that uh we could support

736
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,960
estonian and french troop in operation

737
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,159
parking in

738
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,119
mali

739
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,560
and uh in regular patrols our robots

740
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,520
supported our dismounted infantry by

741
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,960
covering uh

742
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
acquiring supplies and most importantly

743
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,879
additional water for the troops um

744
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,199
the second aspect of the picture is that

745
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,040
doesn't it really look like

746
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
like a real peacekeeping mission when

747
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
you go out with a robot like satz and

748
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,800
all children came out and walked with

749
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
the patrol throughout town and

750
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,359
escorted this uh this parade and the

751
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,918
last point here that while our brave

752
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,239
robot is going first

753
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
the big brother

754
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
manned vehicle is still behind and for

755
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
foreseeable future there will be manned

756
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,240
unmanned cooperation which will turn

757
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,640
we'll see it within 10 years it will

758
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,359
turn into unmanned manned cooperation

759
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
where robots go first

760
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,280
that will

761
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
shift the tables and turn the tables and

762
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
we see quite a lot of changes during the

763
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,880
next five to ten years but we discuss

764
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,359
those at next cycle so thank you very

765
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,520
much

766
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,800
thank you very much martin mart norma

767
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,760
for such a spontaneous and active

768
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
uh presentation and um

769
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,800
i don't know did you agree would you be

770
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
open for one question

771
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,800
or well i think i can take all questions

772
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
but probably we want to go to drink

773
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
coffee so

774
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,640
okay no then thank you so much you can

775
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,400
see up and ask questions when you find

776
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,960
