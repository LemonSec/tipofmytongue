1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,320
morning

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,000
thanks all very much for having me my

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,399
name is nathaniel gleicher and i am the

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,800
head of security policy at facebook

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,120
my team coordinates our work across the

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,920
company to track and counter adversarial

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,040
threats

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,279
determined actors that are looking to

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
either manipulate our platforms

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
target users across the internet or

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
cause other types of harm online

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,199
my background as he mentioned i spent

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,439
some time as a security engineer i was

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,359
then a cyber crime investigator worked

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
in government on the policy side and now

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,320
in the private sector so i've been in

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
the security world for quite some time

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
from different directions

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,040
and one of the things you hear

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
consistently in any security

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,399
conversation i feel like perhaps one of

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,960
the most common aphorisms or phrases is

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
that attackers have the advantage online

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,800
that the adversary has an advantage

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
and it's certainly true that when a

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,640
threat actor can move first when they

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
have surprise that gives them a first

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
mover advantage

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
but what i want to talk about today is

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
the other side of the coin which is the

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,960
advantage that defenders have because if

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
attackers have a first mover advantage

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
then defenders all of us here in this

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,119
room the partners we work with we have a

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,520
networked advantage that builds over

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,560
time

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
let me explain what i mean by that

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
our team tracks threats around the world

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
a wide range of threats this might be an

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
influence operation that a foreign

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
government is using to try to manipulate

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,640
an election

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
it might be a coordinated campaign to

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
surveil or monitor the critics of a

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
regime or a government

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,200
it might be a spam or a sort of

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
financially motivated effort to scam

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
people to try to steal money

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
for all of these we're seeing threat

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
actors try to come up with new

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
techniques but there are some specific

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
things that i think all of us already do

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,439
and can do together to contain these

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
for a little bit of context

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,799
this map is a map of all of the

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
influence operations

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
that our teams have identified removed

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
shared information about and then

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
disclosed publicly over the past few

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,640
years

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
there are about 200 or close to 200 up

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,680
here

63
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,439
they cover they originate in more than

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
50 countries

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
more than a dozen languages

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
they've targeted people around the world

67
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
when you look at this you see a pretty

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
good number of dots from different

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
places

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
and you can see that uh there's not just

71
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,200
a distribution but it's a whole range of

72
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
targeting interesting uh just floating

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,959
in the skies if there was a country

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
there

75
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,480
but it's not just influence operations i

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
want to talk about five different types

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,239
of threats that we track and think about

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,200
first

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
overt influence operations efforts to

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
manipulate public debate in your own

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,640
name think about state media

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
second

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
covert influence operations efforts to

84
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
hide your identity and then use that

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
anonymity to manipulate public

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
discussion

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,840
third

88
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,599
espionage or you might call cyber

89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,159
espionage surveillance

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
hacking into compromi compromising and

91
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,239
taking over accounts trying to monitor

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,720
regime critics or targets

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,519
fourth scams and click bait we talk a

94
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,120
lot about government threats but i think

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,879
everyone in this room knows one of the

96
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,280
most determined adversaries any of us

97
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
face are scammers

98
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,599
and then last what i would call emerging

99
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,640
harms

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
which is an evolving threat space where

101
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
groups of real people come together to

102
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,200
try to drive other types of harm online

103
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
it might be to harass individuals it

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
might be to brigade or silence them it

105
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
might be to target ddos attacks or other

106
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
types of threats

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
these are each different types of

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
threats but there are common patterns

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
behind them

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
and what i wanted to do is to talk about

111
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
two things

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
first some of the adversarial trends

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
that we've seen around the world in

114
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,599
recent years

115
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
ways that the adversaries are moving and

116
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
continuing to move and exploiting their

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,439
advantage

118
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,599
and then second what we can do as

119
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,798
defenders to counter that

120
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
so to start with adversarial trends i

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,720
want to talk about four ways in which

122
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
we're seeing threat actors adapt and

123
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
evolve particularly over the period of

124
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
the pandemic

125
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,560
first

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
blurring the lines between authentic

127
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,640
speech and manipulation one of the

128
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
things you'll notice i talk about these

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,279
is i'm talking about both disinformation

130
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
and influence threats and then hacking

131
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
and cyber security threats

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
if you think about an influence

133
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
operation back in 2016 it was actually

134
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,840
somewhat straightforward you build a

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
large network of fake accounts

136
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
and you use them to amplify a false

137
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
narrative

138
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,639
today those techniques don't work as

139
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
well anymore and they don't work that

140
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,360
well because defenders around the world

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,800
in government

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
in industry in civil society have gotten

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
better and better at catching those

144
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
operations and so we're seeing threat

145
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
actors evolve their techniques and try

146
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
to use different techniques in

147
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
particular they are continually trying

148
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
to blur the line between legitimate

149
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,479
speech

150
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
and manipulation and to make it harder

151
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,880
and harder for defenders to tackle these

152
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
threats

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
as i go through each of these trends i'm

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
going to reference some of the cases and

155
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,919
operations that our teams have removed

156
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,600
around the world to give some context so

157
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
let me give you a couple of examples

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
first of these is an operation from the

159
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
end of last year

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,400
that was that originated in china and

161
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
was designed to undermine trust in covid

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,120
vaccines and reasonable covid health

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
mitigations

164
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
it was centered around a false identity

165
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
a fake scientist supposedly based in

166
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
switzerland that didn't exist that was

167
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,639
calling out and criticizing a number of

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
these healthcare approaches

169
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
now that sounds like an influence

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
operation but the amplification for it

171
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,400
the way that they tried to get everyone

172
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
to pay attention to it wasn't fake

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
accounts it wasn't bots

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
it was real people in particular a large

175
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
number of individuals that worked with

176
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
or were associated with chinese state

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
entities that were amplifying this

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
message

179
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
and so you see a combination of a false

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
narrative a false identity and real

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
people amplifying the story

182
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
which raises a question for defenders

183
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
what's real and what's not

184
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
where do you draw the line and how do

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
you enforce against this

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
the second example here is something

187
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,319
we've seen increasingly when you think

188
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,560
about crises around the world

189
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
whether you think about the trucker

190
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
convoy in the united states or the

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
invasion of ukraine and the surrounding

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
events

193
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
we know that people care deeply about

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
these issues and engage about them

195
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,039
online and unfortunately one of the

196
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
things we've seen is that scammers

197
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
unsurprisingly know this too

198
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
and they will create fake communities

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
to bring in people who care about these

200
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
issues

201
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
it might be a group on facebook it might

202
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
be a hashtag on another social media

203
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
platform and they'll gather real people

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
together and those people will begin

205
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
discussing and caring about what's

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
happening there's a real legitimate

207
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
debate happening

208
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
but the scammers will use that community

209
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,919
they've created to target those people

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,720
for financial fraud for scams and tricks

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
other types of things

212
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
and so now you have

213
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,360
real legitimate public debate

214
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
among real people

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,280
happening in a space created by an

216
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
adversary

217
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
and being used to target those innocent

218
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,840
people

219
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
so where do you draw the line

220
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,759
do you take that conversation down even

221
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,680
though it's a real debate

222
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
how do you protect the innocent people

223
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
it's a great example of the type of

224
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
innovation we see from these adversaries

225
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,840
they're trying to come up with new

226
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
techniques that make life harder

227
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
and harder for defenders

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
second trend the rise of threat actors

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,520
for hire

230
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
on the cyber security side for years we

231
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
have seen specialization within the

232
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
criminal world threat actors that build

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
a criminal skill and then offer it for

234
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
sale

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,080
we're seeing this more and more broadly

236
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
around from adversaries online

237
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
so what i mean by that is a threat actor

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
might have a legitimate business

239
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,479
and on the side they sell let's call it

240
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,879
slightly less legitimate services to

241
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,840
slightly less legitimate

242
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,800
people i'll give you a couple of

243
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
examples and talk about what these mean

244
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
first if we think about influence

245
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
operations and disinformation we

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
increasingly see pr firms selling

247
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
disinformation as a service

248
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
a particular example here which came

249
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
from last year was when a russian-based

250
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,479
pr firm

251
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
was looking to undermine trust

252
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,080
in covid vaccines and they tried to hire

253
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
influencers

254
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
real people on the internet to talk

255
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
about how untrustworthy these vaccines

256
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,200
were

257
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,440
our teams and others identified and

258
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
exposed this operation

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
but one of the consequences of threat

260
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
actors for hire

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
is that they can hide the real actor

262
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
behind the campaign when our teams

263
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
investigate we can figure out who the

264
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
firm is it was a pr firm named faze

265
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
they're based in russia

266
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,640
we might all have hypotheses about who's

267
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
behind this

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
about who paid for this service but no

269
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
one can prove it

270
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,399
because if you make the purchase offline

271
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
it can be very hard to identify who

272
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
hired the operator and so you create a

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
layer of obfuscation

274
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
we let thread actors hide themselves

275
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
the second example of this is that

276
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,640
threat actors for hire proliferate these

277
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
threats

278
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
there are many organizations out there

279
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
that don't have the skill

280
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
to run a hacking campaign

281
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
or run an influence operation but they

282
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
have money

283
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
and so if you can buy these services we

284
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
increasingly see smaller governments

285
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
political campaigns

286
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,760
and a wide range of criminal actors

287
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
availing themselves of services they

288
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,040
couldn't have used before a great

289
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
example of this the surveillance for

290
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
hire industry which we put out a threat

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
report on detailing seven organizations

292
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
that are effectively cyber mercenaries

293
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,800
that sell their services to the highest

294
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
bidder

295
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
makes more and more of these threats

296
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
available

297
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
to threat actors

298
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
third example of trends

299
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
blending operations

300
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
at the beginning i mentioned those five

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
types of threats

302
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
overt influence operations

303
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
covert influence operations

304
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
spam and click bait

305
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
espionage and emerging harms

306
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
it's important to think about the types

307
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
of threats we face but threat actors

308
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,519
don't limit themselves to one tactic

309
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
they have a goal and they use whatever

310
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
tactics they can to accomplish it

311
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
and increasingly we see them blending

312
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
their techniques

313
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
to cause as much harm and make life as

314
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
difficult as possible for defenders

315
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
one operation that our team's removed is

316
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
called ghost rider which a number of

317
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
people in this room i suspect have been

318
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
tracking on your own organizations and

319
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
we've worked together with you and i

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
appreciate all the support in the

321
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
partnership

322
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
this is an organization that has been

323
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
operating across eastern europe in

324
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,399
particular

325
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
and they identify high-profile

326
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
individuals

327
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
they compromise their accounts

328
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
and then they try to use that compromise

329
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
to push false narratives

330
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,399
for example

331
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
since the invasion of ukraine we've seen

332
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
this organization target ukrainian

333
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
military officials

334
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,000
attempt to compromise their accounts

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
across a wide range of social media

336
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
platforms

337
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
and then use those accounts

338
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,959
to suggest

339
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,480
that the ukrainian military is

340
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
surrendering

341
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
they are combining hacking

342
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
compromising accounts with influence

343
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
operations we're seeing this blend

344
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
another good example of this is an

345
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
operation in azerbaijan that was

346
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
primarily domestically focused and was

347
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,959
looking to silence critics of the regime

348
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,279
and using a wide range of tactics to do

349
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
this it might include compromising their

350
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
accounts

351
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,760
coordinating large communities of

352
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
accounts and people to silence or

353
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
criticize people trying to get their

354
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,600
accounts reported to be taken down

355
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
and running influence operations they

356
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
combine all of these techniques to

357
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
accomplish their goal and so as we think

358
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
about countering them it's really

359
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
important to remember they don't limit

360
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
themselves to one type of threat right

361
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
the threat actors don't just hack into

362
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
operations or run influence operations

363
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
they blend these together to be as

364
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
effective as possible

365
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,800
and then the last example that i have

366
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
here is called diversifying targets

367
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
increasingly we see threat actors not

368
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
just targeting one platform

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
or one environment but multiple ones

370
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
so again that ghostwriter operation i

371
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
mentioned is a great example of this

372
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
they operate by first compromising the

373
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,360
email of their targets and then from

374
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
there they pivot through all their

375
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
social media accounts

376
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
a consequence of this is that if we or

377
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,120
any of those other defender teams

378
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
identify a compromised account

379
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
we can lock the account down but it

380
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
turns out it's very hard to return

381
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
control of the account back to the user

382
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
because if their email is compromised

383
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
if their devices are compromised and we

384
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,079
give them back control the threat actors

385
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
just take it over again

386
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
and so this blending and targeting of

387
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
multiple platforms makes it harder and

388
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
harder for defenders because no single

389
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
team can tackle this alone we have to

390
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
partner across industry and civil

391
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
society to get ahead of these threat

392
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
actors and we're seeing them try to

393
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
attack the spaces between us

394
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
and make it harder for us to respond

395
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,479
quickly

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
so these are four different trends that

397
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
we're seeing threat actors invest in and

398
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
exploit

399
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
this looks like the attacker advantage

400
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
everyone hears about

401
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,839
very specifically we're seeing them use

402
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,639
their first mover advantage

403
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,760
but there are a number of things that

404
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
defenders can do to make this less

405
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
effective and to tackle these threats

406
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,639
and the first thing to just say is

407
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,920
as defenders no single institution or

408
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
community can tackle the types of

409
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
threats we see online by themselves you

410
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,600
have to have

411
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
tech platforms in industry

412
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
government the media and civil society

413
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,079
all working together to tackle these

414
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,279
threats

415
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,279
and that's because each of these players

416
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
brings a different set of skills and

417
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
tools to the field that make life harder

418
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
for the threat actors

419
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
and i've talked a lot about attacker

420
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
advantage

421
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,720
i promise to talk about defender

422
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
advantage and here's what i mean by that

423
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
attackers have a one-off advantage

424
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,279
they get to move first if you think

425
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,720
about the game of chess there's a

426
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
concept called tempo the white player

427
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,800
moves first and that gives them

428
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
initiative the attackers have that

429
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
advantage they can exploit it with

430
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,839
surprise

431
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,040
and they can make life harder for

432
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
defenders

433
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
but defenders have a network advantage

434
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,079
a systemic advantage

435
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
over time

436
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,040
if we tackle multiple operations and we

437
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
work across multiple sectors we can make

438
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,320
life harder

439
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
and harder for the threat actors

440
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
imagine again playing that game of chess

441
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
and the white player makes a move and

442
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,639
you see the move that they make they

443
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
like the pawn up to kings two

444
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
and you watch their play

445
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
and then next time you play them

446
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
you can actually change the chess board

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
and put a river right through the middle

448
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,240
of the board to slow them down you can

449
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
actually change the environment to make

450
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
it harder for the threat actors

451
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
that is the defender's advantage and

452
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,199
it's incredibly powerful and i think we

453
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,680
undersell ourselves a lot on what we

454
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
could do here

455
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
let me give you an example of what i

456
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,959
mean

457
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
we think about this from the concept of

458
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
adversarial design

459
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,320
and the adversarial design cycle

460
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
normally when you're developing products

461
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
you're developing products for your

462
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,839
users

463
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
and you would hope and expect that the

464
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
users might come up with new uses

465
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,480
because that probably means a new

466
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,759
business line

467
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,639
it probably means new opportunities

468
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,279
how do you design products

469
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
for adversaries

470
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,759
that is the question of the adversarial

471
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,600
design cycle how do you design products

472
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
to be resistant

473
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
to the types of threats we're talking

474
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
about

475
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
we do that in four steps

476
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,880
that i think are interesting to think

477
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,279
about and generally applicable first

478
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
threat ideation

479
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
using strategic foresight to think about

480
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
what do the new threats look like how

481
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
are they changing and how do we get

482
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
ahead of them

483
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
second threat disruption tracking and

484
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
countering threat actors as they develop

485
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,759
on the platform

486
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,759
third

487
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
improving your defenses you can't just

488
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,399
tackle the bad actors you have to change

489
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
the platform to be more resistant to

490
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
them this is that changing the

491
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,639
chessboard example that i offered right

492
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,240
so as a simple example one of my

493
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
favorite ones

494
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
in 2016 threat actors used advertising

495
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
to try to influence an election we built

496
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
a whole series of defenses to make

497
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,199
advertising more resistant to this in

498
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
particular requirements that if you want

499
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,959
to run a political ad

500
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,320
you need to prove you're from the

501
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
country that you're targeting

502
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,959
and we've seen this work because we've

503
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
seen threat actors try to get around it

504
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
and fail

505
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
my favorite story is a threat actor

506
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
russia link threat actor wanted to run

507
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
fake ads

508
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,359
couldn't defeat our systems

509
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
they hired a criminal group to try to

510
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,119
run ads for them a criminal group based

511
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
in nigeria

512
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
and that group took the money

513
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
and never ran the ads

514
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,679
you would think they would have seen

515
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
that coming

516
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
that's exactly the type of constraint

517
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
you can put on these threat actors they

518
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,080
spend their time trying to defeat your

519
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
systems instead of running operations

520
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,960
and then you put all this together with

521
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
partnerships that point that i mentioned

522
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
about the entire society working

523
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,640
together

524
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
now one tool that is incredibly

525
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
effective in this tool belt that we're

526
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
starting to see more of but i think it's

527
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
not that well understood yet

528
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
is public disclosure

529
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,720
as deterrence

530
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
now this is something we saw deployed

531
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
very effectively by a number of western

532
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,720
governments in the lead up to and since

533
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
the invasion of ukraine

534
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
and

535
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,720
threat teams here at facebook at meta

536
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
and around the room use this as they

537
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,679
disclose operations

538
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
but i think it's important to ask what

539
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,240
this does and how to use it effectively

540
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,039
public disclosure it doesn't stop threat

541
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
actors from running campaigns if you

542
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
think it will then it won't and you'll

543
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,880
be disappointed what it does is it

544
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,679
degrades their effectiveness even if

545
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
they run a campaign it won't work as

546
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
well

547
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,919
if you know someone's running an

548
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,360
influence operation

549
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
and they're going to push a particular

550
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
false narrative

551
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
getting the narrative out in advance and

552
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,919
saying they're going to do that makes it

553
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,760
less effective

554
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
if you know that a threat actor is

555
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
targeting a particular community with

556
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
phishing or specific exploit

557
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
warning that community so they can

558
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,760
protect themselves and know what's

559
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
coming

560
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
makes the operation less effective

561
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
each time you do this you degrade the

562
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,720
adversary and you strengthen defenders

563
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
if you remember my point about a

564
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
networked advantage when you disclose

565
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
information you empower all the

566
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
defenders around society

567
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
and yes when you disclose campaigns you

568
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
can deter adversaries you can make life

569
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
hard for them

570
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,039
but it's important to understand who the

571
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
adversary is

572
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
and how you can do that

573
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
for example for certain criminal actors

574
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
if you disclose their operations that

575
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
can expose them to criminal liability in

576
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
their country

577
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
for organizations like those

578
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
threat for hire companies

579
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
they often have a legitimate business

580
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,919
and an illegitimate business

581
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
if you expose their illegitimate

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,960
business

583
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
that puts their legitimate business at

584
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,360
risk and it puts their fundamental

585
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
business model at risk it can be a very

586
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
effective technique

587
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,840
for countries that run operations like

588
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
this and don't tell anyone

589
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
they're probably trying to play

590
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
themselves off as legitimate players in

591
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
the world stage when you expose this you

592
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
make it harder and harder for them to

593
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,280
pretend that they're above the fray

594
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
and for some threat actors just getting

595
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
exposed and caught can make them look

596
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
foolish

597
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,200
remember i think it's very important one

598
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
of the most impactful effects

599
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,159
of the russian operations that targeted

600
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
the u.s election in 2016

601
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,919
is that they made russian activity look

602
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
incredibly effective online and they

603
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,600
were able to create this image of

604
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
themselves as almost invincible online

605
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
they used that

606
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
but over the past four years we have

607
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
seen their operations get caught

608
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,919
again

609
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
and again

610
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
we've seen them be disclosed early

611
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
before they can reach very many people

612
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,640
and before they're that effective and

613
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,200
what that does is it pierces

614
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,919
that claim of invincibility and it shows

615
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,720
you

616
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
that they aren't as powerful as they

617
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,919
claim they are disclosure can be a

618
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,000
deterrent and it can contain these

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
threat actors and i think it's a tactic

620
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
we can use across society

621
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,919
at meta we do this through our threat

622
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,240
reporting so we produce a quarterly

623
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
threat report that discloses all the

624
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
types of operations that we've been

625
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
tackling over the past quarter

626
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
shares information about them

627
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,760
and then we pair that with specific ttps

628
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,159
and data sharing to governments to

629
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,559
industry and civil society partners

630
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,919
and the goal here is to contain the

631
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
threat actors

632
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,080
and also to empower defenders around the

633
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,679
world

634
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
we've seen other teams do the same thing

635
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
the teams at twitter the teams at google

636
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
the teams at microsoft use the same

637
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
technique

638
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,799
and cta the cyber threat alliance has

639
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,000
been very effective in this space as

640
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,520
well so this is a really powerful tool

641
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
but these principles can apply to each

642
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
of the communities i mentioned

643
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
industry government civil society and

644
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,919
media let me talk about a couple of the

645
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
things that different parts of society

646
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,440
can use

647
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
to build this defender's advantage that

648
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
we've already seen

649
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
from a platform perspective i think that

650
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
the public disclosure and the data

651
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
sharing piece is absolutely critical

652
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
because we see threats that others don't

653
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
and getting that information out to the

654
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,200
defender community is one of the most

655
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
important things we can do

656
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,320
but that piece about adversarial design

657
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,799
is absolutely critical

658
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,000
because

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,679
increasingly large volumes of the

660
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,640
threats we're all tracking happen across

661
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
major technical platforms

662
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,679
and that means that over time we can

663
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,159
change those platforms to make them more

664
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,159
resistant to bad actors

665
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,840
that example of the ads that i mentioned

666
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,039
is one of them

667
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
another one we have automated systems

668
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
that detect and block fake accounts

669
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
incredibly quickly millions of them

670
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,039
every day many of them within minutes of

671
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,400
creation

672
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,280
now

673
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
if you're a determined adversary you can

674
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,159
still create a fake account we all know

675
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
that no automated system by itself

676
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,799
will stop a nation state or a determined

677
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,480
actor

678
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
but they are forced to work harder

679
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
and harder for every inch of game and

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
that change empowers everyone it creates

681
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
that network effect where the bad guys

682
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
are forced further and further downhill

683
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,039
and the good guys have a stronger and

684
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,440
stronger position

685
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
government has an incredibly important

686
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
role here as well

687
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
in a couple of different ways the first

688
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
i'll mention is in the context of

689
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,679
regulation i mentioned at the top that

690
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,520
we're seeing threat actors use grayer

691
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
and grayer techniques to try to blur the

692
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,480
lines

693
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
we're also seeing more and more domestic

694
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,919
actors try to manipulate public debate

695
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,799
in situations like this regulation to

696
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,600
define the boundary between

697
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
impermissible manipulation and

698
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
legitimate debate is extremely important

699
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
the other key area is in deterrence if

700
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
we think about those

701
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,960
threat for higher actors governments

702
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,279
have an incredibly powerful opportunity

703
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
to make life hard for them to limit the

704
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
ability to indiscriminately sell hacking

705
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
tools and surveillance tools and to

706
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,279
constrain their ability to make these

707
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,840
threats more difficult

708
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,279
also have particular intelligence

709
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,480
capabilities

710
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
surprises known in this room that

711
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,000
government intelligence services have

712
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
specific tools that industry and civil

713
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,880
society does not and should not

714
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,240
but that means that they will see

715
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
threats sometimes that no one else sees

716
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
there have been a number of times in the

717
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960
past several years where an early tip

718
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
from a government has helped us identify

719
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
and counter a broad threat and so that

720
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
type of sharing is extremely valuable

721
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,039
and perhaps most important

722
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
it's essential that democracies in

723
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
particular

724
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,880
lead in this space

725
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
and the reason i say that is we want

726
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
democracies to define

727
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
what constitutes legitimate activity and

728
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
legitimate public debate online because

729
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,520
if they don't

730
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,840
there are a bunch of autocratic regimes

731
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
that are very happy to do it around the

732
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
world and are already trying to do it

733
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,320
recent work here in europe has been

734
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
incredibly encouraging and i'm hoping to

735
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,600
see more and more of this around the

736
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
world to define these rules and

737
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,679
boundaries

738
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
media and civil society is the last

739
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,320
category and they're also an incredibly

740
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,440
important community and they're

741
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,559
important for a couple of different

742
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,919
reasons

743
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,679
first they bring expertise in

744
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,760
investigations that cross different

745
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,039
platforms

746
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,559
i should note actually interestingly the

747
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
vendor community also brings this

748
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
expertise the ability to investigate not

749
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
just in one platform or another but

750
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,600
across multiple ones if we think about

751
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
threat actors targeting multiple

752
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
platforms the most memorable perhaps is

753
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
an operation called secondary infection

754
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,240
run that was russia-linked that our

755
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
teams identified and a number of teams

756
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
enforced against that ultimately

757
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,960
existed on more than 300 platforms

758
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
across the internet

759
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,720
right to tackle these very broad

760
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
operations you need the ability to look

761
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
across multiple spaces civil society

762
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
brings a particular expertise there

763
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,520
also topical expertise in a country or a

764
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,840
region that a platform or an industry

765
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,640
team might not have

766
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
also civil society in particular has a

767
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
level of legitimacy

768
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,360
a different type of legitimacy right now

769
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
uh i know it'll be a big surprise to

770
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
everyone but trust in industry and

771
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
government is not exactly the highest at

772
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
the moment

773
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,559
and it's very important to have voices

774
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,039
in civil society that can validate that

775
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,799
can agree with and that can hold the

776
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
other players to account when they need

777
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,960
to to make sure that industry and

778
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,559
government is doing its part to tackle

779
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,120
these threats

780
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,799
in all of this i think there's a

781
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,640
particular challenge for civil society

782
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,120
and for the media which is when you talk

783
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
about these operations i talked about

784
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
disclosure as deterrence

785
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,279
you also have to be careful not to play

786
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,360
into the hands of the threat actors not

787
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
to use too much hyperbole

788
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
and to end up making them seem more

789
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
powerful than they are

790
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,000
there's a careful line to walk here but

791
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
it's an extremely powerful and critical

792
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
one

793
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,840
so i've talked about four

794
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,360
types of defenders

795
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,559
government

796
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,520
industry civil society and media and a

797
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
range of different techniques that we

798
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
see threat actors using

799
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
the core thesis of all of this though

800
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
is that on the one hand we know that

801
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
adversaries are continuing to innovate

802
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
they are continuing to move quickly

803
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
and they're exploiting the surprise that

804
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
they have

805
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,039
each time they come up with a new

806
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,120
technique they can surprise defenders

807
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,760
and try to steal a march on us

808
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
and they're doing that across a range of

809
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,799
threats

810
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
they're increasingly willing to blend

811
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,000
their techniques

812
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
to target multiple operations or

813
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,159
multiple platforms and to do whatever

814
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,960
they need to do to surprise defenders

815
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,159
all of that

816
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,799
is about the attacker advantage

817
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,640
that one-off advantage that they keep

818
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
exploiting

819
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,120
but when you look around at defenders

820
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
we have a very clear advantage too and

821
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,240
that advantage is networked it's the

822
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,000
fact that there are multiple teams

823
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,679
across society

824
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,120
it's the fact that

825
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
we tackle multiple operations we see

826
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
these tactics and techniques and we can

827
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,240
build systems to make them less and less

828
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
effective over time

829
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
and the best outcome of all of this is

830
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,799
that the attacker's advantage is fairly

831
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
consistent they can always surprise you

832
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
but it's always just a surprise and then

833
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
you've seen it and you can defend

834
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,840
against it

835
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
the defender advantage scales

836
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
exponentially

837
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
each time a platform increases its

838
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
systems to make it harder for bad actors

839
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
that helps all defenders

840
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,039
each time a vendor develops a new

841
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,039
detection system that can catch these

842
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,960
actors more effectively that makes it

843
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
better for all defenders

844
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,039
each time a government passes a

845
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,960
regulation or a framework that deters

846
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,559
threat actors and makes life harder for

847
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,000
them that makes it better for all

848
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,840
defenders and worse

849
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
for all threat actors and each time we

850
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,399
all any of us share information we build

851
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
up teams around the defender community

852
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,159
to tackle the threats and so over time

853
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,399
the defender advantage scales much

854
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,600
faster

855
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,760
than the attacker advantage

856
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,840
and so i often hear these talks about

857
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,600
the advantage that attackers have and

858
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,919
how impossible it is to climb over but

859
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,600
the honest truth is i think that it's

860
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
completely in the other direction

861
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
and if we go back to this map of dots

862
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
floating in space

863
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,559
that i started with

864
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,399
when you look at it at first it just

865
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,840
looks like a lot of operations right

866
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,039
there's a lot of these dots they're all

867
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,279
over the world there's a lot of threats

868
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,399
but if you look at the bottom of the

869
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,360
screen

870
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
you will see a track of operations

871
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,720
detected and removed by year and what

872
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,559
you're seeing there is that these

873
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,960
operations are getting caught more and

874
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
more as time passes

875
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
they're getting caught sooner

876
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
and they're getting caught before they

877
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
can reach the audiences and have the

878
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
effect that the threat actors want

879
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,200
that is the defender advantage

880
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
the biggest difference in influence

881
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,159
operations from 2016 to today

882
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,039
is that today there are determined teams

883
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,640
countering these threats

884
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,679
in government in civil society

885
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,080
in industry and in media

886
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
and they're all working together

887
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,880
and when we do that we make life harder

888
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
and harder for the threat actors and

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,440
easier and easier for defenders

890
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,600
so thank you all for all the work that

891
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,679
you're doing the thesis of defender

892
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
advantage is that everything that all of

893
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,640
us does improves defenses for each of us

894
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
uh unfortunately i do not have time for

895
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,159
questions at the end of this but i will

896
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,520
just say

897
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
a number of the talks here today have

898
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,679
helped me and yesterday think through

899
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,679
the challenges we're facing and how we

900
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,679
tackle these pieces i would love to talk

901
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,200
further about it so if anyone has any

902
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,480
questions please come up to me

903
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,159
afterwards there are a few members of

904
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,240
our team here that have driven a lot of

905
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,919
the threat threat disruptions and

906
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,919
takedowns i described so we'd be happy

907
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
to talk further about it thank you all

908
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,080
very much
