1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,960
good afternoon uh thank you all for

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,200
coming on time from the break my name is

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,480
kuba machak

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
i'm a legal advisor at the international

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
committee of the red cross and i have

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
the honor and the pleasure and the

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,839
privilege today to moderate this

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
fascinating panel

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,439
so uh

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
maybe just a few words about the themes

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,320
of the panel and how i think it might

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
all come together and then we will see

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
towards the end if you agree with me so

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,679
a few words uh from uh the perspective

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,120
of the icrc you know perhaps you're

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
wondering why uh someone from the icsc

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
would be standing here so as a

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
humanitarian organization we monitor the

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
technological developments and the ways

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
that especially military technology

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
develops and how these are being used

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,760
what are the potential human costs of

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
such uses of new military technologies

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,559
and then the extent to which the law

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,399
might need to be clarified or further

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
developed in light of these military

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
developments and the potential human

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
costs

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
and so also

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,359
together with the ccdcoe of course the

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
organizer of our wonderful cycon we have

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
a joint project called the cyber law

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,720
toolkit where i have the pleasure of

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,799
acting as the general editor on the side

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
of the icrc and there are five other

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
institutions that participate in that

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
and that project as many of you know

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
some of you being involved quite closely

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
looks and explores many of the themes of

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
how international law applies to cyber

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,680
operations which is what we will be

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
discussing to a great extent today as

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,560
well

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,680
so

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
the name of the panel you know new

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,680
technology and state responsibility you

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
might be forgiven for thinking well we

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,240
are at the conference on new technology

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
so aren't all panels a little bit about

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
new technology

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
and state responsibility when you have

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
international lawyers probably all

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
matters of international law could to

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,079
some extent be reduced to questions of

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,399
state responsibility which forms of a

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
part of the fabric of international law

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
here so if you want some other

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
suggestion on what to focus on as you're

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
listening to our three wonderful

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
speakers today

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
let me suggest that all of these three

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,758
papers share that they explore this

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,239
triangular relationship between humans

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
technology and knowledge and knowledge

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
in the sense knowledge that humans have

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,360
of the uses of this technology and

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
sometimes the ways that the the uses of

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
technology distort our understanding of

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
what's happening so what do i mean by

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
that we will have petr stacekal who is

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
on my right from uh paletsky university

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
and he will explore how knowledge of a

74
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
situation that's created by the use of

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
new technologies can sometimes be based

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
on a flawed understanding of

77
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
the facts that we have and so his topic

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,519
will be to look at deceptive

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
misattribution and so he will be

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
presenting a paper that uh he wrote

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
together with martin fykes who is also

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
in the audience hi martin it's very nice

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
to have you here as well

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
so then we have arun sukhmar from the

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
fletcher school of law and technology

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
sorry fletcher's

87
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
law and technology fletcher school of

88
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
law and diplomacy

89
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,120
but indeed looking at how the knowledge

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
that new technology can provide us so

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
these vast amounts of complex

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,360
information that automated threat

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
detection systems can provide us what

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
impact this knowledge can have on the

95
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
obligations that states have for example

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
the obligation of due diligence so again

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
very much this theme of exploring the

98
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,799
interaction between humans knowledge and

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,120
technology and then we have talina van

100
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
bentem from oxford university

101
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
who will look at

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
autonomous weapon systems

103
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
and the extent to which the uses of

104
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
autonomous weapon systems are covered by

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
human knowledge and human intent and so

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
what happens if these autonomous

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
functions of such technologies result in

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,560
unintended consequences and so what are

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
the legal implications of this under ihl

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
so i think with these small teasers you

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
can already see that this is a

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
fascinating panel i look forward to

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
exploring you know these threads that

114
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,439
will go through the panel together with

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
you during the q a

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
and because you're all here not to

117
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
listen to me but to our panelists i have

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,640
the honor of presenting once more so on

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,159
my right hand side dr peter stacekau who

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
is a lecturer in international law at

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,798
the palazzki university in olomou in the

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,199
czech republic and he's also currently a

123
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
visiting researcher at the university of

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
vienna

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,080
and his topic is legal aspects of

126
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
misattribution caused by cyber deception

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
better the floor is yours

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
okay thank you for cuba for the

129
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
introduction and uh good afternoon uh

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
it's a big pleasure to stand here and

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
share our research with such a expert

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
audience and diverse audience it's

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
already announced though we will be

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
today speaking or i will be speaking

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
about the research of me and my

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
colleague concerning cyber deception

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
just to briefly inter

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
go through the contents of our topic of

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
the presentation

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,440
i will explain of

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
what exactly we mean by attribution that

142
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,320
we address in our presentation

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
what is the concept or and what legal

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
aspects we actually address because it

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
has many uh legal aspects of course

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
then we will focus

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,880
on uh

148
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
[Music]

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
these aspects from the point of view of

150
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
different actors just to briefly uh

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,320
explain deception is generally an

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
activity that we can encounter in uh

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
basic uh interactions as individuals in

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
everyday life

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
the in this deception that we address in

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
our research is a situation which i will

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
describe later in great detail but from

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
the beginning it's necessary to

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
understand is a situation when one state

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
decides to conduct a fourth like cyber

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
operation against another state

162
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
with the aim that this another state

163
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
misattributes this attack to another

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
victim state first state and responds to

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
some measures against the third victim

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
states and this response to the victim

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
state might or is in our scenario is the

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
aim of this uh false flag operation uh i

169
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
will provide some examples that this

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
actually might happen and that we

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
already have some uh cases of false flag

172
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,520
attacks

173
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,080
uh of course by their nature we don't

174
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,039
have always data that we need

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
but this concern this is also a concern

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
for

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
intelligence agencies also nato ccdcoe

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,639
prepared just this year

179
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,520
reports on mitigation of consequences of

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
false flag and no flag operations

181
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,400
but

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
quite interestingly this issue didn't

183
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,800
attract the attention of at least legal

184
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
doctrine so far it's discussed obviously

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
in technical sciences uh in i.t sector

186
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
but not in international law as far as

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
we are concerned

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
therefore uh in our research we focus uh

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
or we present this concept of

190
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
misattribution caused by deception

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
we point to its complexity

192
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
and to some extent of legal voidness

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
in that regard

194
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
we focus on issues such as the

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,199
relevance of mistakes of fact in

196
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,680
developing responsibility responsibility

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
of the deception as such a

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
responsibility for the

199
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
red for the measures retired measures

200
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,919
and the following

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
so first of all

202
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
as i already explained what do we mean

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,440
by cyber deception generally deception

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
by definition

205
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,720
is a situation when two parties interact

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
one party

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
causes the other party to adopt as a

208
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,879
true specific incorrect version of

209
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
reality

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,199
with the aim to cause this other party

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,960
behave in a way that benefits the

212
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
deceiving party just very general

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
definition but it's probably part of our

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
daily lives if we see advertisements we

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
can see it in the sports we can see it

216
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,039
on the interstate level reality that to

217
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
some extent

218
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,919
uh

219
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
society or members of society uh engage

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
in in deception it's also part of

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,879
inter-segregation in terms of

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,800
negotiation of treaties application of

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
treaties of course it's also utilized on

224
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,479
operational level as a military tactic

225
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
from another point of view

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
it's also part of cyber defense

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
strategy in technological sense

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
we focus on cyber deception as i

229
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,360
described as a specific and more

230
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,399
advanced form of deception which is now

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
looming in practice

232
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
where there is a specific element of the

233
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
aim of causing misattribution

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
to a victim state and as part of this

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,839
aim also reterritory measures of the

236
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,800
deceived state against the victim state

237
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
what we do not address in our

238
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
presentations are the questions of the

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
obligations on primary level of the use

240
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
of force of breach of sovereignty we

241
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
rather we also do not focus

242
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,399
in detail on rules of attribution

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
as there are already uh discussed

244
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,839
extensively elsewhere we focus on the

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
explanation of this scenario and

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,839
implications on the level of

247
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,240
state responsibility

248
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,120
so in our hypothetical scenario

249
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
these are the

250
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
responsive measures which are the aim of

251
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
the

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
deceiving state

253
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
with terms of in terms of methods that

254
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
can be utilized

255
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
we believe that in order to really uh

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
cause uh strong reterritory measures

257
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
against the victim state as

258
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
indeed the goal of the deception

259
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
the false flexible operation must have

260
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
certain level of gravity

261
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
so this

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
preliminary or primary false flag

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
operation

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
could

265
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
target critical infrastructure of the

266
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
deceived state

267
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
electric power grid and the trace is the

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
question of the illegality of this false

269
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
flag operation as such which we will

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
describe later

271
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
in terms of technical means

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
of course i'm a lawyer so i'm not

273
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
expert on it sector but

274
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
practice already shown that it's

275
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
technically possible to leave force

276
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
traces in a cyber sector

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
by either using specific segments of

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,399
codes which are known to be used by

279
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
specific non-state actors or state

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
actors which are available in some

281
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
depositories archives or which were

282
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
otherwise unveiled

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
this of course doesn't go alone it's

284
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,640
usually

285
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
accompanied by intelligence

286
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
it can be also accompanied by falsely

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
provided intelligence information

288
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
and it can be also

289
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
fit or put into the overall

290
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
uh

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
political

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
scene and motivations of targets because

293
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
attribution as such is not focused only

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
on forensic technical level but is a

295
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
multi-layered operation where in other

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
aspects including political and

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
intelligence service information are

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
also part of that analysis

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,519
just to provide some examples maybe the

300
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
most

301
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
known example is the so-called olympic

302
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,880
destroyer malware which were used in

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
2018

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,600
in the olympic games in north korea

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
south korea sorry

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
originally this

307
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
attack was uh

308
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
traced back to north korea but later

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
months later it was unveiled at least by

310
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
the us and uk

311
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
that the original actor is actually the

312
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,040
russian fsb uh

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
not fsb gru unit

314
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
that used some codes and other

315
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
footprints that were pointing to north

316
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,519
korea it also makes sense on the level

317
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
of policy because of course because of

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
the reality of the two countries

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
so this is one of the examples which

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,880
caused quite severe damage to the uh

321
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
to this event because

322
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
the visitors and also the athletes and

323
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,160
also representative states there were

324
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
their devices were hacked and not

325
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
functioning

326
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
other examples are seen

327
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
usually

328
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,519
as

329
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
aiming to point to iran for example so

330
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
we had multiple cyber operations in

331
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
middle east or against israel where

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
false traces are lived in order to point

333
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,360
to iran

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
so for example

335
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
chinese units

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
allegedly

337
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
attacked israelis governmental and

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
non-governmental

339
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
targets

340
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,880
originally they used

341
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
traces and tools

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
usually used by

343
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
iranian groups including the language et

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,680
cetera but later on it was revealed that

345
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
it was china rather than

346
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
than iran also

347
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
russia is using the same strategy there

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
are some documented cases where there

349
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
attacked multiple targets

350
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
in the middle east and this selection

351
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
variety of targets it perfectly makes

352
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
sense

353
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
that iron iran would be the outer

354
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
because it fitted to its overall

355
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
strategy and interests

356
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
but it also used some some segments of

357
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,480
codes used by young actors but it was

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,839
actually a russian turla group which

359
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,680
utilized this method of deception of

360
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
course these are just few cases we have

361
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
which are publicly known

362
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,600
with some certain level of probability

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
and by the nature of cyber deception we

364
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
do not know

365
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,440
how many of these operations were

366
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
conducted with success of misattribution

367
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
and some severe damages

368
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,519
but

369
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,920
the problem with that strategy is that

370
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,079
it's actually uh

371
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
the cyberspace offers a space and

372
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,880
methods for utilization of that strategy

373
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,519
for gaining a goal of uh

374
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
harming third country with potentially

375
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,399
little costs for for the deceiving state

376
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,040
and usually also

377
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,199
hidden behind the mystery of policy

378
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
considerations because states do not

379
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
want themselves to

380
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,639
unveil maybe a misattribution or these

381
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
other steps but if we look at the

382
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
scenario which i just described with

383
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,199
some brief examples we can see that

384
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,600
there are actually two acts of two

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
distinct actors which we need to

386
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
distinguish in order to qualify that

387
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
qualify them legally

388
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
so if we focus on the false flag

389
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
operation as such we can ask

390
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
what are the legal consequences of

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
course it depends on the nature of the

392
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
operation

393
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
typically it might be uh rather some

394
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
severe form of operation or at least the

395
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
malware that is at least capable of

396
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,600
causing uh

397
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
some serious injury to the state

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
infrastructure

399
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
which would have higher probability of

400
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
really motivating to deceive states to

401
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
to counteract

402
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
so we can we can

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,079
analyze this operation we have

404
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,000
information and on the level of primary

405
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
law it can be the bridge typically the

406
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,839
breach

407
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,920
of sovereignty of another state

408
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
prohibition of

409
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
intervention and also eventually maybe

410
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,079
prohibition of use of force really

411
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
depending on the nature of this false

412
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,920
flag operation

413
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
however more interesting question is uh

414
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
whether this deceiving state can be

415
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,480
responsible for actually the response of

416
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
the deceived states against the victim

417
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,519
state uh because if really the the whole

418
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,279
aim or the whole goal of this tactic

419
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
unfolds and really the receive state

420
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
responds to to the allegedly wrongdoer

421
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
with same or measures or countermeasures

422
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
and other measures it is a question

423
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
whether the deceiving state can be

424
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
somehow responsible for

425
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
for the damage caused to the victim

426
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
state

427
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,240
it's actually a very compelling question

428
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,079
we analyzed the rules of international

429
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
responsibility

430
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,240
because it's possible that the basic

431
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,079
principle is is that we have a principle

432
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,880
of

433
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
independent responsibility we also it's

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
also possible

435
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,199
that there is a joint or responsibility

436
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,040
plurality of responsible states for the

437
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
same conduct

438
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
but moreover uh international law also

439
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
provides for

440
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,680
some the

441
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
concept of derived responsibility so

442
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
there are specific forms of drive

443
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
responsibility where one state can be

444
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
responsible for the contact of another

445
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
state conduct of another state

446
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,440
and these are aid or assistance coercion

447
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
or direction on control we analyze those

448
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,330
grounds for

449
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,839
[Music]

450
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
derived responsibility whether

451
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
this scenario fits to any of them

452
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,279
uh what is relevant in that case that of

453
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
course the victim state would have a

454
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
claim against the deceiving state um

455
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,959
deceiving state might have been

456
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,040
internationally responsible and at the

457
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
same time depending on which of these

458
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,280
grounds would be utilized the deceived

459
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
state might for example uh

460
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
have a plea of force majira and maybe

461
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
evade his responsibility

462
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
for example if we had a case of coercion

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
but if after a closer look in into these

464
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
grounds for derived responsibility

465
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
we can see that this scenario does not

466
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
fit to any of them uh in terms of aid of

467
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,559
or assistance of course it's natural

468
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
that the deceased state

469
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,919
does not know the origin and or the true

470
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,480
origin and intent of the of the

471
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,679
deceiving state so it's probably not

472
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
aiding or assisting at least not

473
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,799
willingly

474
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,039
with respect to coercion there would

475
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
have to really be some coercive element

476
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
and in situation where the dc state is

477
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,440
not aware of any deception this

478
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,720
deception

479
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
it probably is not

480
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
deprived of a freedom of action it just

481
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
decides

482
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,559
on its own uh to respond to the victim

483
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,200
state as a alleged wrongdoer

484
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
and or not

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,200
with respect to

486
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
directional control there would have to

487
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,200
be some relationship of dependence

488
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,039
between the deceived and deceiving state

489
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,600
which of course also is not the case in

490
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
in this scenario where the civ state is

491
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
not aware of any activity of deceiving

492
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,640
state

493
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
so we can see that the rules of

494
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
international responsibility as we

495
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,000
understand them do not allow for

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
developing

497
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
responsibility of the deceiving state

498
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,919
for the conduct of the deceived state

499
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,840
so we also analyzed

500
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
another grounds we asked

501
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
or looked into international law whether

502
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
the

503
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,720
the act of deception as such could not

504
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
be in violation of some primary norm of

505
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
international law

506
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
uh deception as such is not regulated in

507
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,200
international law with some small

508
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
exceptions in in

509
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
law of armed conflict we have the

510
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
prohibition of perfectly

511
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
on operational level

512
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
but generally ruses of war are not

513
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,120
prohibited it's stated by additional

514
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
additional protocols

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,559
one and two

516
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,280
there may be also some bilateral or

517
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
multilateral

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,200
agreements of friendship uh commerce and

519
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
cooperation between the states

520
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
then maybe the deception could be

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
contrary to these uh agreements

522
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
depending on their existence and text

523
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
but on general level on the level of

524
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
general international law we had

525
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,799
difficulties in finding any uh positive

526
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,520
obligation which would be breached by

527
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
the mere act of deception

528
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
by doing a false flag against another

529
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
country with the intention to cause

530
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,559
damage to the victim state

531
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
however we have some principle which

532
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
which can be close uh this is the

533
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,840
secular 2o principle

534
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
which can be expressed

535
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,320
sorry this is the slide which can be

536
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
expressed by the no harm principle

537
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
but again

538
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,640
on one hand this principle serves as a

539
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
limitation of state sovereignty

540
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
it would also have some some advantage

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
for the victim state because it would

542
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,840
not have to necessarily uh

543
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
establish

544
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
intent of the deceiving state it would

545
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
just have to establish that it failed to

546
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
prevent its territory to be used

547
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
contrary to its rights but there are

548
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
problems with

549
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,360
this principle at

550
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
the first step it's still debated

551
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
whether no harm principle exists

552
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
as an obligation a separate obligation

553
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,679
as such in context of cyberspace

554
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,760
it has been originally

555
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
developed

556
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
in case law related to environmental law

557
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
however there are many authors today who

558
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,360
who

559
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
have an opinion that

560
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
no harm principle is already part of

561
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,200
customer international law it's also

562
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
what the telling manual uh is

563
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
indicating

564
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
so this is one question to to really uh

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
understand the nature of no harm

566
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
principle another problem which we

567
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,760
encountered is

568
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
then the application of that principle

569
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
to this conduct is a question whether

570
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
the responsive measures of the deceased

571
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
state against the victim states such as

572
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,080
country or or another cyber attack

573
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,880
whether this can be understood as a harm

574
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
caused or originating in the territory

575
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,080
of the deceiving state um

576
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
on one hand we can say that maybe the

577
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
false the the

578
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
effect of a misattribution as such may

579
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,000
be the harm which is which is

580
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,360
the harm in the sense of no harm

581
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
obligation

582
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
if that was the true if just the

583
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
misattribution would be sufficient to

584
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
establish harm without really needing

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,200
actually responsive measures from the

586
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
decisive state

587
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,840
then we could argue that this harm

588
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
is originating from the territory of the

589
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,559
deceiving state if it used its own

590
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
origins or infrastructure

591
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
but one may also argue that this is not

592
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
the harm which was actually caused to

593
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
the rights of the victim state and this

594
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
is the responsive measures the country

595
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,520
measures which were utilized by deceived

596
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
state against the victim state and in

597
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,799
this case

598
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
is a question whether these if that

599
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,159
would be the harm that we need for

600
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
application of the jewel

601
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
whether it that actually uh could be

602
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,600
considered as originating from the

603
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
territory of the deceiving state because

604
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
it was the free decision of

605
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
well

606
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,360
free decision of the deceased state even

607
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,640
though influenced by a false true

608
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
so this is still

609
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
an issue which is under our

610
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
research

611
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
which still probably needs to be

612
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
addressed and confirmed but our

613
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
conclusions are that the application of

614
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,880
no harm principle

615
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
on this scenario is very complicated

616
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
last issue which is

617
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
opened by this scenario is actually the

618
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
the responsibility of the deceived state

619
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
for the responsive measures which were

620
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,600
motivated by misinterpretation miss

621
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
miss attribution

622
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,240
if

623
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
the receive state responds to

624
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,679
originally

625
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,480
unlawful activity it can be qualified as

626
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,960
a as a country measure

627
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
but country measure

628
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
counter measures have different

629
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
obligations different

630
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,720
conditions and one of the most important

631
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
condition is that it is actually aimed

632
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
against the outer of the wrongful

633
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,919
conduct

634
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
and objectively victim state was not the

635
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,159
author of the false flag operation

636
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,159
and in the rules of international

637
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
responsibility are based on an objective

638
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,360
character so it is the objective to the

639
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
objective reality which plays a role in

640
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,559
establishing

641
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,600
responsibility of a state

642
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
it also

643
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
opens the question of the relevance of

644
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
the mistake of fact whether it actually

645
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,039
has a role

646
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
in developing responsibility of the

647
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
deceased state for misattribution our

648
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
conclusions are that a mistake's effect

649
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,799
does not play a role in establishing its

650
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,200
responsibility because again mistakes

651
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,279
affect as such does not constitute

652
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
circumstance precluding wrongfulness it

653
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,039
also cannot be applied uh within another

654
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,559
existing circumstances recruiting

655
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,919
wrongfulness

656
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
and all of these certain consensus are

657
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
to certain extent also based on an

658
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
objective assessment of the situation

659
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
and it's been stated by the uh

660
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
industrial law commission that when

661
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
deciding whether to resort to country

662
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,640
measures and in developing international

663
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
responsibility

664
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,679
uh the

665
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
the considerations that we have are

666
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
objective and the subjective elements

667
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
doesn't that do not play a role

668
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,000
uh therefore our conclusion is that

669
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
uh international law does not provide

670
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,760
also ground for for the deceiving state

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,960
to escape the uh

672
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
responsibility for for

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
misattributed

674
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,200
countermeasure

675
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,799
to conclude

676
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,440
what do we see in in very briefly uh

677
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
that uh

678
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,919
when we look at

679
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
the context of the deceiving state uh

680
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
it's not fitting into the uh any of the

681
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,080
established uh

682
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
primary norms as we at least uh could

683
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
analyze so far and it's not also fitting

684
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
into the construction of international

685
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
responsibility so it's very hard to

686
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,279
develop

687
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
responsibility of the deceiving state

688
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
for actually the intent of the goal of

689
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
the deception

690
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,679
which is the country measures by the

691
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
deceased state against the victim state

692
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,799
on the other hand when we look to the

693
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
conduct of the deceived state

694
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,159
[Music]

695
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,919
international law also proved to be

696
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,640
short as it's very difficult to evade

697
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,799
responsibility for the deceived state

698
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,480
for the conduct it did against the

699
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
victim state

700
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,159
because of the objective character of

701
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
rules of international responsibility

702
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,279
we can discuss what would be the policy

703
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,600
considerations of course that is another

704
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
question maybe for the discussion but

705
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,240
the best solution probably is that the

706
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,720
victim state and the deceived state

707
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
cooperate and communicate and they can

708
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,039
settle the consequences of the uh of the

709
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,200
countermeasures but of course if that

710
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
would be the aim of the deceiving states

711
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,000
to

712
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
include in his scenario to non-friendly

713
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,960
states uh the pacific solution would be

714
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,919
uh

715
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
quite unlikely

716
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
so thank you for your attention and

717
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
that's all from our site

718
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,919
thank you petra i'm going to remain

719
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
seated here so that we continue in an

720
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,159
informal way so thank you for this very

721
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,600
well structured and carefully

722
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,279
constructed argument pointing at

723
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
possible legal gaps and i'm sure we will

724
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,760
be exploring that further but now

725
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
without any further ado i want to go to

726
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,360
arun so arun sukumar is a phd candidate

727
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
at the fletcher school at tufts

728
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,120
university in the us and a pre-doctoral

729
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
research fellow at the school center for

730
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,039
international law and governance i

731
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
managed to say it without any mistakes

732
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
this time i hope and so arun's topic

733
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
today is responsibility to detect

734
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,440
autonomous threat detection and its

735
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
implications for due diligence in

736
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
cyberspace

737
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,039
uh it's up to you

738
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,880
yeah as you feel more comfortable thank

739
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,919
you

740
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,760
the the sound on my watch that you heard

741
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
when the session began was the wake up

742
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,120
alarm from where i was last so if this

743
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,039
goes south and you feel something is

744
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,640
missing you know what to blame

745
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
um

746
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,399
uh thanks google uh

747
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
my topic the the topic on which i've

748
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,279
written the paper um is the implication

749
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,720
of autonomous threat detection on the

750
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,640
principle of due diligence so i you know

751
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
let me start with a couple of caveats

752
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
first is that um

753
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
i'm focusing on a very specific pathway

754
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
that

755
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
threat detection technology is taking it

756
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
need not be the only way that threat

757
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,679
detection technology evolves

758
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,679
you know it ultimately is a factor of

759
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,000
research and market-based developments

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
but i feel that this is likely to be the

761
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
mainstream way in which future

762
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,679
developments in threat detection

763
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,919
technology are likely to evolve because

764
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,840
it solves as i will get into in just a

765
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,320
minute a hard problem of cyber security

766
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
and in the process i argue that it may

767
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,039
solve also the heart problem of due

768
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
diligence and i also the second caveat

769
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
being unlike uh you know peter and

770
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,360
svetlina's papers which point to a gray

771
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,600
area in um international law that

772
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
they're focusing on

773
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,360
i'm really not looking at a principle of

774
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,559
course there are debates about the

775
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
application of due diligence as all of

776
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,159
you in this room would know but really

777
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
is the effect of this technology

778
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
inducing compliance with due diligence

779
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,360
and at best uh providing

780
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
an expansive interpretation making

781
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,799
possible and expansive interpretation of

782
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,360
due diligence to the sense that it is

783
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
comparable to the application of due

784
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
diligence and other principles of other

785
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
domains of international law uh compared

786
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,559
to cyberspace so that's really the

787
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,279
modest objective of the paper um and

788
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
with that uh the first uh you know

789
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,320
the the first task is really to

790
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
challenge uh to identify the heart

791
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,559
problem of cyber security that that

792
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,080
network operators

793
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,480
face if even if they can even be called

794
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
that uh today and so to with apologies

795
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,480
to uh william gibson who said cyberspace

796
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
is a consensual hallucination experience

797
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,799
daily by billions of legitimate

798
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,360
operators that is today the state of uh

799
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
cyber security because

800
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,440
um it's extremely difficult to to

801
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,320
monitor modern day networks uh primarily

802
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
i argue for three reasons

803
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
the first being that networks operate in

804
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
heterogeneous environments so if you are

805
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,159
the sys admin of uh of a network and if

806
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,240
you are in responsible for monitoring

807
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
the security of the network you have to

808
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,559
account at a minimum for three things

809
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,320
the security of the terminal devices

810
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,399
that your employees or the people who

811
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,200
are part of that network are using

812
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,159
the security policies of the data

813
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,960
processing layer which is often you know

814
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
outsourced to

815
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,520
aws or microsoft azure or

816
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,679
alibaba cloud or you name it some cloud

817
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,080
operator and third the increasing of

818
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,279
loading the increase offloading of uh

819
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,000
networking functions to a cloudflare or

820
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
a vmware um

821
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,480
this is called network functions

822
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
virtualization and many startups are

823
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,120
many small companies that do not have

824
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
the resources to

825
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,760
do

826
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,679
routing or packet switching

827
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,279
or forwarding functions on their own or

828
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,640
just don't have data centers of their

829
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
own are simply just handing it over to

830
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
big companies that are becoming central

831
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
points of failure and we have seen it in

832
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
in terms of the attacks on aws or

833
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,080
microsoft azure and that's true for the

834
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
network layer as well which is not often

835
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
discussed in the same terms as the

836
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,559
cloud-based services and this problem of

837
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,399
multi-tenancy and so this is called

838
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
multi-tenant environments

839
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
is essentially has been compounded by

840
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
the phenomenon that we know of work from

841
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,159
home um and so the idea of and i'm

842
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
hardly the first to say the idea of a

843
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,480
security perimeter as something that is

844
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,919
either geographically or specially

845
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,240
confined is absolutely not true at all

846
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,120
in fact it has become rapidly obsolete

847
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,840
which makes cyber security and threat

848
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,480
detection much more challenging um in in

849
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
today's world the second problem that i

850
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
identify is that of the api ification of

851
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
everything uh apis uh for the

852
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
uninitiated although

853
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
there will be few in this conference uh

854
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
application programming interfaces

855
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,559
they're basically lines of code that

856
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,320
allow for software to communicate with

857
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
each other that are essential in all

858
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
three layers that i spoke about whether

859
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,320
it's at the application or the device

860
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,159
level at the data processing layer and

861
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,760
also the network functions

862
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,919
virtualization by the way the the last

863
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,559
layer the outsourcing is not just of

864
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
routing or forwarding functions but

865
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,960
increasingly of firewall functions or

866
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
ssl functions as well so it's a fairly

867
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
critical

868
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
layer in that sense

869
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
and apis essentially connect these

870
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,840
layers to one another as well as the

871
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,640
main providers to their clients apis are

872
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
the for lack of a better phrase the duct

873
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
tape that holds the internet together

874
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,919
today they are i think akamai estimates

875
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,519
that 83

876
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,159
of internet traffic today is api calls

877
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
these pinging uh pings that happen

878
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,519
between apis but they are notorious for

879
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
their insecurities whether it's lack

880
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
security the presence of so-called

881
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
zombie apis uh you know apis that have

882
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,559
been you know created for a particular

883
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,480
purpose but you know nobody wants to

884
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
update it nobody thinks it's worth their

885
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,519
time to update it uh so all manner of

886
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,120
data breaches that have happened in the

887
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,640
last few years you can probably

888
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
attribute it to uh api uh flaws

889
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,960
including the one on parlor in 2021 on

890
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
microsoft

891
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
uh 365 um the log 4j vulnera is a

892
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
vulnerability but the the main point of

893
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,519
vulnerability exploitation of that

894
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,559
vulnerability is apis so uh and apis

895
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,720
again have been known for exposing data

896
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,799
in a maximalist way have been known to

897
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,799
be prone to credential stuffing attacks

898
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,320
so it is a

899
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
a problem that has received

900
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,399
unfortunately very little attention from

901
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,000
the international legal community as

902
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,159
well given that they are floating in the

903
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,000
ether they are all over the place and

904
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,919
it's uh you know it's it's clearly a

905
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,519
trans boundary problem but something

906
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,159
that's here to say be here to stay uh

907
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,640
given uh that they do at the end of the

908
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
day provide interoperability to services

909
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,720
and critical functions uh that are

910
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
essential to the internet today uh there

911
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,159
are also design flaws that are

912
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
associated with uh or poor

913
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,320
understandings of apis uh that are

914
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
associated that are associated with apis

915
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,799
for example a recent study a technical

916
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
study found that

917
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
apis that were used that were provided

918
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
by amazon and google for things like

919
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,559
facial recognition the people who

920
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,120
actually used amazon and google's ml

921
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
apis for facial recognition they did not

922
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,200
know how to distinguish between object

923
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
classification and image detection they

924
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
are two different things uh the object

925
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,440
classification happens within the image

926
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
whereas that is conflated for the image

927
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
itself so you can see that this is a

928
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,279
grave problem but like i said something

929
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,880
that hasn't really received a lot of

930
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
attention but uh you know in short it

931
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,440
makes a threat detection a lot more

932
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,679
challenging also because uh you don't

933
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,040
really know i mean there's clearly no

934
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,879
legal response which comes to my third

935
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,839
point

936
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,960
no clear national regime maybe

937
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,040
over generalizing this but

938
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,399
there are no

939
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,760
there's no

940
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
regime that clearly states you know the

941
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,119
response is it the developers

942
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,960
responsibility the api developer who

943
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,719
develops the api given that there are

944
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,679
not facing and south facing apis uh

945
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
which api has resulted in the data

946
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
exposure or the breach or the attack

947
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
these are you know somewhat technical

948
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,639
questions that uh uh no have no clear

949
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,480
legal answers and finally related to

950
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,280
this uh data protection policies have

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
tended with rare exceptions to focus on

952
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
the last mile that is the relationship

953
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,760
between the user and the device i don't

954
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
think that has changed um and this makes

955
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,760
again given the the fact that the

956
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,920
the multi-layered nature of digital

957
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,359
networks makes cyber security

958
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
challenging it's really surprising that

959
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
data protection policies haven't really

960
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
again with rare exceptions haven't

961
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,400
really focused on stuff that's happening

962
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
outside of the relationship between the

963
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,040
user uh

964
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
and the device although there have been

965
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
some policy responses some strong policy

966
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,200
responses for example australia in 2000

967
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,839
in november 2021 passed a law that would

968
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,359
essentially allow it to command

969
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,280
commandeer the resources of cloud-based

970
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,320
providers

971
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,119
if they felt that the cyber threat in

972
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,119
question is extreme and the cloud-based

973
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,760
provider has not provided uh adequate

974
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,599
remedies to its clients including

975
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,960
critical infrastructure that is owned

976
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,560
and operated by the government but it's

977
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,720
really you know anybody's guess whether

978
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,119
these kind of post-facto measures um you

979
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,640
know you can imagine this you know the

980
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,560
outrage if this were an authoritarian

981
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,680
government that came up with this kind

982
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
of a policy response it's also not a

983
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
good precedent i feel uh but these are

984
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,160
the kind of responses that you see uh

985
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
of governments to the problem of

986
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
securing

987
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,480
multi-layered digital networks

988
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
faced with the problems that i have

989
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
mentioned

990
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,079
users or commercial operators

991
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,520
essentially have three

992
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
options

993
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,079
to autonomously detect uh cyber security

994
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,720
threats and i mean here's the sort of

995
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
the the important part it's not really

996
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
the autonomy of

997
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
the models that i'm reviewing that

998
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,920
really make it important it's the fact

999
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
that they are able through autonomy to

1000
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,040
cover all aspects of the all layers of

1001
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
the digital network that i'm talking

1002
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,720
about the device the data processing

1003
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,119
layer and the network uh layer um and um

1004
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,960
face with the problems that i outlined

1005
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,160
below

1006
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,599
states

1007
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,680
commercial operators have three options

1008
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
one is to go by

1009
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,079
a layered security model where the

1010
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,760
device security is managed by the

1011
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
provider of the device or the

1012
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
application the developer of the

1013
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
application uh cloud security is

1014
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,000
provided by amazon or azure or whoever

1015
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
it is and the network security is

1016
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
provided by cloudflare given that there

1017
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
is likely to be inconsistencies in the

1018
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,920
security policies of these three

1019
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
services this is probably not a good

1020
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
approach to follow second is a

1021
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
host-based security increasingly if you

1022
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,680
are a uh you know

1023
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,440
an owner of a business or a start-up you

1024
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
will realize that amazon and microsoft

1025
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
are themselves providing uh security

1026
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,760
which they claim to have a greater

1027
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,079
visibility uh over the network than just

1028
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,599
the cloud service i don't know to what

1029
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,680
extent this is true that's one option

1030
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
and given that uh most small companies

1031
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,920
are likely to put all their eggs in one

1032
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,680
basket in one cloud service provider

1033
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
this probably makes sense and given that

1034
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,280
you increasingly reach

1035
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,200
you know the law of increasing returns

1036
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,520
kick in with regard to these big cloud

1037
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
service providers it probably makes

1038
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,560
sense to go with their security because

1039
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
then amazon can inform you of some

1040
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,720
threat that has not affected you uh that

1041
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,560
immediately but is likely to in the

1042
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,240
future given that they have experience

1043
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
dealing with threats elsewhere the last

1044
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
is third-party security so i guess you

1045
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,119
know you could approach um a checkpoint

1046
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,920
or a or a crowdstrike or a fire eye

1047
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,160
which claim now to increasingly use

1048
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,400
autonomous threat detection and and

1049
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,760
multi-cloud

1050
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,359
detection so you don't have to be locked

1051
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,440
into a particular vendor whether even if

1052
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
it's cloud-based or network-based um

1053
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,359
but you know these three again they just

1054
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,200
provide for autonomy they don't they

1055
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,119
don't fully tackle the problem of the

1056
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,640
multi multi

1057
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
uh the multi-layered problem uh

1058
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,880
multi-layer problem of cyber security

1059
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,079
and that of

1060
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,800
monitoring digital networks so uh i'm

1061
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
going to talk briefly about two projects

1062
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
uh two multi-stakeholder projects one is

1063
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,680
a pilot project that received um i think

1064
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,119
two million dollars or something from

1065
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,960
euros from the eu

1066
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,040
which has the backing of major telecom

1067
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,359
operators like ericsson but it's also

1068
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,119
developed by academic researchers so

1069
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,119
take this with a you know pinch of salt

1070
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,720
that this will be the model that is

1071
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,880
going to be implemented in the in the

1072
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
years to come the astral project which

1073
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
stands for addressing threats to

1074
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,800
visualize virtualized services

1075
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
essentially involves

1076
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,960
three components which the image

1077
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
corresponds to roughly as well

1078
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,280
a data plane a control plane and a

1079
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
management plane what the data plane

1080
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,240
does is interface with all elements or

1081
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
all layers of the digital network

1082
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,280
including the device the cloud layer and

1083
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,119
the you know the routing layer or the

1084
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,520
firewall layer manages because all of

1085
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,680
these layers have security policies that

1086
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
essentially involve collecting logs or

1087
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,320
collecting uh security uh details from

1088
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
their kernels or libraries and the data

1089
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,560
layer of this application essentially

1090
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
pings them to get that information the

1091
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,079
control layer which is essentially a

1092
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,560
plane that runs on

1093
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,480
intelligent algorithms

1094
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
dictates the data layer to say that you

1095
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
should be devoting this much resources

1096
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
to the collection of data based on some

1097
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
anomalous anomalous traffic that we are

1098
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
seeing uh

1099
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
and based on uh the data that is sent by

1100
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,000
the top layer it is able to arrive at

1101
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,480
inferences and learn based on a certain

1102
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
volume of uh you know unusual or

1103
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,200
anomalous activity it can

1104
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,280
uh over time say confidently that this

1105
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
is the nature of the threat this is the

1106
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
intended target this is the in the uh

1107
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,079
the uh the intent the the origin the

1108
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,640
source uh of of these threats uh that's

1109
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
with respect to the control uh layer and

1110
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,480
the management layer essentially is the

1111
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,400
human facing element of this um

1112
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
of this application or of this framework

1113
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
this framework can be abstracted to you

1114
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,640
know create any kind of application two

1115
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,319
things are necessary for this kind of

1116
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,920
application to happen

1117
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,240
which are in the in the works hence you

1118
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,800
know it fits in the new technologies

1119
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
remit of this panel the first is the

1120
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,800
availability of computing resources to

1121
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,359
do all of this um you know

1122
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,280
you have to if you're a small business

1123
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,680
or startup you need to be able to

1124
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,119
offload computing resources to

1125
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,800
gather data from

1126
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,640
various components of the network and

1127
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,119
also to continually learn based

1128
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,640
on the inferences that are being

1129
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,160
developed by the algorithm and the data

1130
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,280
that is being processed by the

1131
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,119
application i think this is closer to

1132
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,720
reality because you know computing

1133
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,880
resources today are not hard to come by

1134
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
at least for the limited purpose of what

1135
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,359
we're talking about um what is even more

1136
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,400
important is the uh the the presence of

1137
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,119
interoperable standards um for the data

1138
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
layer to ping say an application a cloud

1139
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,599
layer and a network layer they all

1140
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,560
should respond uh providing data to this

1141
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
uh

1142
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,040
uh program and for that you need to

1143
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
develop interoperable standards for

1144
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,599
network security functions this project

1145
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,560
too is currently underway it's called i2

1146
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,119
nsf inter interface to network security

1147
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,920
functions um this is one initiative that

1148
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
has been developed that that has been

1149
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,000
created by a group of actors which

1150
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,800
includes major companies uh under the uh

1151
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,960
umbrella of the ietf

1152
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,400
and uh hopefully uh this project as well

1153
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,240
as comparable projects can lead to the

1154
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,079
development of

1155
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,280
comparable

1156
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,839
interoperable standards so this is the

1157
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,319
technology part and

1158
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,800
how does it help operationalize the

1159
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,480
cyber due diligence principle

1160
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
specifically i mean not to get to this

1161
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,720
into great detail but specifically i

1162
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,160
want to say that the due diligence

1163
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,000
principle also requires that the

1164
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,760
standard of care that's owed by states

1165
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,599
is you know it cannot be the same that

1166
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,599
they ordinarily employ in domestic

1167
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
concerns it has to be specifically

1168
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,839
addressed to tackling uh significant

1169
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,400
trans boundary harm also there is this

1170
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,720
recommendation by the ilc when they were

1171
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,319
discussing the subject in 2001 that

1172
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,000
states should keep abreast of

1173
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
technological changes so and it's these

1174
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
two you know principles of cyber of due

1175
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
diligence as it is applicable to

1176
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,720
cyberspace that uh this uh technological

1177
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,200
development i argue will really uh

1178
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
tackle i think it will

1179
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,280
enhance the scope of obligation of

1180
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,000
states in a cyberspace just to sort of

1181
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
step back for a minute

1182
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
states can

1183
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,119
take advantage of the application that i

1184
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,160
mentioned or the framework that i

1185
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
mentioned in two ways they can either

1186
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
develop an atd application of their own

1187
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,119
and say all private actors all public

1188
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,359
actors in their digital economy should

1189
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,599
use it they can mandate it by law if not

1190
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,640
they can develop an api and ensure that

1191
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,720
or they can essentially ensure that such

1192
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,319
applications that are used by private

1193
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,440
sector

1194
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,920
actors or public actors essentially are

1195
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,079
connected through an api to their certs

1196
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,800
which are notified of their threats in

1197
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,280
re of such threats in in real time and

1198
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,960
what atd applications do

1199
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,720
with respect to cyber due diligence i

1200
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
argue four things

1201
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,560
one it helps specifically mitigate

1202
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,000
trans-boundary digital harm one of the

1203
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
problems that um

1204
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,319
states face both with respect to the

1205
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,760
threshold of

1206
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,599
actual and constructive knowledge is

1207
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,680
that there is no alignment i feel

1208
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,119
between the legal standards and

1209
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,440
technical standards today um actual

1210
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,599
knowledge which would be when a state is

1211
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,560
either

1212
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,040
aware or notified in good faith is the

1213
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,800
gge language

1214
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
is actually not enough

1215
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,520
for a state to meaningfully address

1216
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,720
to stop

1217
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
harmful

1218
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,520
actions the

1219
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,720
harmful

1220
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,800
digital operations that are occurring in

1221
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,119
its territory because for example the

1222
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,839
mirai botnet the if you take the example

1223
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,520
of the mirai botnet case

1224
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,160
the infiltration or the compromising of

1225
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,680
digital infrastructure had occurred

1226
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,920
months before the actual botnet attacks

1227
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,160
began and at the time the operations

1228
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,800
begin it might be too late for a state

1229
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
to really stop

1230
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,720
the the digital harm the trans boundary

1231
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,040
harm from taking place without um

1232
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,960
corrupting the integrity of the digital

1233
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,640
infrastructure in question depending on

1234
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,480
the scale of the operation and i feel

1235
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,800
that atd applications can provide a

1236
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,280
modest solution to this problem uh by

1237
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,079
ensuring that the learning component of

1238
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
uh the atd application tells you that

1239
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,800
this is the port from which this uh

1240
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,560
threat has originated from or this is

1241
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,800
the point of vulnerability that has been

1242
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,119
previously targeted we are observing

1243
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,200
anomalous activity and therefore this is

1244
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,800
where this threat is originating from

1245
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
and also crucially say that this is

1246
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,040
based on previous behavior this is

1247
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,920
likely to be the intended target of uh

1248
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
cyber operations i mean it may not be

1249
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,440
completely and this is the human

1250
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,359
interface that's critically important

1251
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,040
but providing that kind of knowledge

1252
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,359
with regard to the originator uh the

1253
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,440
source uh and specifically the

1254
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,119
destination can provide um you know can

1255
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,560
be helpful in operationalizing the due

1256
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,119
diligence principle um

1257
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,040
aligning in the legal and threshold uh

1258
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,119
technical thresholds i've spoken briefly

1259
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,000
and i feel more importantly it can i

1260
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,200
think the

1261
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,680
uh um you know please correct me if i'm

1262
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,520
wrong but i think the consensus seemed

1263
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,119
today the application of due diligence

1264
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,680
in cyberspace is limited to stopping

1265
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,839
digital harm rather than an obligation

1266
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,400
to prevent and to detect and prevent and

1267
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,319
i feel that autonomous threat detection

1268
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,280
technology provides the avenues by which

1269
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,520
states can at least detect maybe they

1270
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,119
will still not have the resources to

1271
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,960
prevent it but certainly the ability to

1272
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,280
identify harms at an early stage and

1273
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,960
therefore expand the scope of the

1274
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
obligation to what it is and say

1275
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,920
environmental law

1276
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,359
and finally uh

1277
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,599
you know autonomous threat detection can

1278
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,680
i feel also uh this the argument that i

1279
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,000
make in the paper uh identify um

1280
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,520
operations that are transiting through

1281
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,160
territory transiting uh is essentially a

1282
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,480
feature of routing rather this is a

1283
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
feature of routing is not random but

1284
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
it's usually a you know the shortest

1285
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,839
path that data takes and it's either the

1286
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
availability of computing resources that

1287
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,680
makes a difference or the the presence

1288
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,640
of

1289
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
you know asn's and root servers and so

1290
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,520
on and so forth um whereas uh with the

1291
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,920
ability to learn based on previous uh

1292
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,000
behavior a state i feel could

1293
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
have greater confidence say that this

1294
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,800
operation is this this anomalous

1295
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
behavior is transiting through

1296
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,359
my territory for the express purpose of

1297
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,000
um you know creating digital harm that

1298
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,079
is of a transboundary nature and i feel

1299
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,880
this is one of the reasons why you feel

1300
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,920
um

1301
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,599
while you see countries that are

1302
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,040
regional hubs like the netherlands and

1303
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,359
singapore have two different views on

1304
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,720
the application of due diligence

1305
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
netherlands being for the application of

1306
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,000
a very strong

1307
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
principle of due diligence to cyberspace

1308
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,680
whereas singapore

1309
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,359
which may be a factor of both its

1310
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,880
resources but as

1311
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
the the tensions in in asia and

1312
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,200
southeast asia may make it more cautious

1313
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,359
uh has a much more measured and cautious

1314
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
approach to cyber due diligence and says

1315
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,599
that it you know you have to really come

1316
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,480
to terms uh you have to come to uh

1317
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,000
you have to have more clarity on the

1318
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,920
degree of knowledge that is required to

1319
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,599
operationalize this due diligence and i

1320
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,920
feel that technical measures like atd

1321
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
can help transit states so-called

1322
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,400
transit states um operationalize this

1323
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,040
better and there

1324
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,800
agreeing to the application of this

1325
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,200
principle is critical to the you know

1326
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,040
that i say the universal implementation

1327
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,440
of um

1328
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,960
cyber due diligence because they are the

1329
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,040
states that have key internet exchange

1330
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,160
points um critical internet resources

1331
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,000
that are shared by a number of countries

1332
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,839
and therefore they're buying into the

1333
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,839
cyber due diligence would be um

1334
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
critically um

1335
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,760
would be crucial to the to the the

1336
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,359
overall acceptance of this principle so

1337
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,640
that's where i'll stop i know that's a

1338
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,319
lot of information to take in but hope

1339
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,960
it was helpful

1340
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
so thank you arun for this presentation

1341
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,400
i would say that you know in the best of

1342
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,480
traditions of psycho and really marries

1343
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,960
the technical analysis with the legal

1344
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,359
analysis as well and all thank you also

1345
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,880
for you know explaining some of the

1346
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,400
technical terms to those that you

1347
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,720
describe as uninitiated i mean i plead

1348
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,800
guilty as charged but i'm going to

1349
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,640
remember from now on that application

1350
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,640
programming interface is the duct tape

1351
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,400
that holds the internet together i mean

1352
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,839
that's something that i'm definitely

1353
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,000
taking away so thank you so much and i

1354
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,440
think that's a very good bridge to our

1355
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,599
third presentation which is by swetlina

1356
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,520
fanbentem and so

1357
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,440
is a researcher at merton college at the

1358
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,440
university of oxford and also at the

1359
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,000
oxford institute for ethics law and

1360
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,319
armed conflict and also a lecturer in

1361
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,760
international law for the oxford

1362
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,160
diplomatic studies program today

1363
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,559
svetelina has a paper on exploring

1364
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,720
changing battlefields autonomous weapons

1365
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,559
unintended engagements and the law of

1366
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,960
armed conflict so the floor is yours

1367
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,040
thank you thank you kubo

1368
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
i will resist the trend of remaining

1369
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,800
seated because without my glasses i

1370
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
really need to be very close to the

1371
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,559
screen with my slides

1372
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,400
it is a pleasure to be with all of you

1373
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,480
this afternoon and it was such a

1374
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,200
pleasure to hear these two presentations

1375
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,880
which link really well with what i'm

1376
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,800
going to be talking about today and that

1377
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,960
was very well summarized by kubo at the

1378
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
very beginning when we think about this

1379
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,760
triangular relationship between users

1380
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,480
technology and knowledge

1381
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,960
so what we will be talking about

1382
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,079
in my presentation is ruptures of intent

1383
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,480
we'll be looking at ruptures of intent

1384
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,720
that occur between the point at which a

1385
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,079
party to conflict initiates an attack

1386
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,800
and the attack's outcome

1387
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,880
so in a way what we're looking at is

1388
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,440
when things not go according to plan

1389
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,680
for the attacker

1390
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,520
i'm going to narrow down this topic

1391
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
which is quite big in itself in two ways

1392
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,240
the first one is to be looking at a

1393
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,280
specific military capability on this

1394
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,839
occasion autonomous weapon systems with

1395
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,319
autonomy in their target selection and

1396
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,559
engagement and the second way in which

1397
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,240
i'm going to narrow down the topic is to

1398
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,839
look at the framework of the law of

1399
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,200
armed conflict

1400
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,000
such that i exclude legal qualifications

1401
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,400
under international human rights law

1402
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,240
under international criminal law and

1403
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,240
other applicable rules and regimes

1404
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,079
now something which is interesting about

1405
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,319
many of the topics within the area of

1406
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,880
technology and law is that while we

1407
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,920
focus on a very specific question on

1408
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,400
this occasion unintended outcomes in

1409
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,079
autonomous weapons

1410
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,280
these debates raise questions around the

1411
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,119
applicability and the scope of

1412
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,359
international legal rules such that they

1413
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,640
expose certain gaps in our understanding

1414
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,119
of even fundamental rules of regimes

1415
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,520
such as the law of armed conflict

1416
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,200
so this is what i'll be focusing on

1417
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,079
today how factual uncertainty and legal

1418
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,480
uncertainty really drive us to a point

1419
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,559
in which we're not entirely sure what is

1420
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,559
prescribed and what conduct the party to

1421
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,160
conflict needs to engage into being

1422
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,839
compliant with in compliance with the

1423
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,079
law

1424
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:36,880
so

1425
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,280
the specific inquiry on autonomous

1426
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,839
weapons is going to go through

1427
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,319
three stages and i know that we all have

1428
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,200
an enchantment with three easy steps to

1429
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,520
things so we're going to be looking at

1430
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,280
first the problem

1431
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,040
second the law

1432
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,920
and third a way forward

1433
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,240
when it comes to the problem itself

1434
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,160
we'll be looking at features of armed

1435
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,960
conflict more generally and certain new

1436
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,760
ways in which war is being waged and how

1437
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,880
they affect uncertainty

1438
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,559
on the law while the paper addresses two

1439
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,240
prohibitions under the law of armed

1440
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,960
conflict the prohibition of attacking

1441
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,640
civilians and the prohibition of

1442
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,280
indiscriminate attacks for reasons of

1443
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
time i'm only going to be addressing the

1444
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,520
first of the two

1445
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,599
and then when it comes to a way forward

1446
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,960
what i'm interested in is really

1447
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,640
investigating the role of positive

1448
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,640
obligations under international human

1449
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,280
rights law and their role as information

1450
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,040
generators

1451
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,200
and how these information generators

1452
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,359
interact with the operationalization of

1453
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,520
the prohibitions

1454
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,720
now the problem

1455
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
there are many layers of factual

1456
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,680
uncertainty in the way in which conflict

1457
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,960
is waged and these factual uncertainties

1458
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,920
can be generators of significant harm to

1459
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,000
civilians consider for example

1460
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,480
information uncertainty

1461
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,880
this can lead to the misidentification

1462
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,839
of targets and we have many unfortunate

1463
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,920
examples in which a party to conflict

1464
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,160
intends to engage a lawful military

1465
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,359
objective

1466
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,599
but factually direct its attack against

1467
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,280
civilians or civilian

1468
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,480
objects

1469
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,599
another concern are weapons malfunctions

1470
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,400
because here as well we see a disconnect

1471
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,240
between the intent of the attacking

1472
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,079
force and the actual

1473
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,400
outcome so with both these scenarios

1474
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,520
when it comes to mistakes in

1475
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,280
identification and with malfunctions

1476
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,240
there is a mismatch between the intent

1477
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
and the way in which the attack actually

1478
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,119
unfolds

1479
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,760
now these uncertainties are not

1480
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,440
new

1481
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,920
um even writing in the beginning of the

1482
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,079
19th century clausewitz talks about the

1483
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,119
great uncertainty of all data

1484
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,599
malfunctions happen as well rifles

1485
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,400
misfire missiles go astray laser beams

1486
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,319
get deflected

1487
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,160
there is an acceptance that when we talk

1488
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,480
about weapons there is a

1489
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,680
level of tolerance of error so we cannot

1490
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,000
expect there is going to be perfect

1491
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,680
operation at all

1492
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,880
times

1493
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,359
but there are certain ways

1494
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,040
in which

1495
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,200
the landscape of conflict is changing

1496
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,720
one of them

1497
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,240
is for example when we think about the

1498
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,880
localities of conflict

1499
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,800
many contemporary conflicts are waged in

1500
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
urban centers

1501
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,480
now this exacerbates risks to civilians

1502
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,880
why first of all in itself the fact that

1503
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,799
it's waged in urban centers but also

1504
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,720
because of many tactics of groups that

1505
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,559
may be hiding behind or within the

1506
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
civilian population

1507
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,280
and then a second form of uncertainty

1508
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,520
which is a new one

1509
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,000
is the ways in which autonomy is getting

1510
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,319
introduced within the decision-making

1511
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,720
processes such as there is an additional

1512
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,799
decision-making element

1513
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,720
on specific selection engagement of

1514
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,280
targets that occurs after the decision

1515
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,440
making to employ a system a weapon

1516
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,160
system towards the point of impact

1517
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,599
so with this in mind we can think a

1518
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,480
little bit about autonomous weapons

1519
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,040
systems there have been many discussions

1520
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
around the risks of unpredictability

1521
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,799
that reside in them

1522
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,880
when i talk about autonomous systems i'm

1523
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
going to be talking about a degree of

1524
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
independence in the selection engagement

1525
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,119
of targets but it is accepted that

1526
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,280
autonomy is not a yes or no question

1527
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,200
it's something that comes in degrees it

1528
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,200
comes in relation to different functions

1529
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,559
of a system

1530
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,319
and also it can accommodate different

1531
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,480
types of supervision and interaction

1532
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,559
between humans and the machines

1533
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,839
now the reason why this is an

1534
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,359
interesting topic to start thinking

1535
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,200
about unintended outcomes is because

1536
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,079
they raise very starkly this question of

1537
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,559
how intent is travelling from the humans

1538
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,880
in the party to conflict to the

1539
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,359
battlefield to the ground

1540
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,960
and there have been many discussions

1541
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,160
already for

1542
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,599
decades really between a range of

1543
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,200
stakeholders

1544
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
most prominently maybe at the group of

1545
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,960
governmental experts only through

1546
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,559
autonomous weapons systems which is

1547
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,079
convened within the framework of the

1548
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,599
convention on certain conventional

1549
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,359
weapons

1550
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,119
and what is really helpful is that this

1551
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,359
group there was an acceptance that

1552
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,079
international law applies to these

1553
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,040
weapon systems now this is important why

1554
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,960
because applicability of international

1555
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,040
law is the gateway for us to even

1556
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,440
consider how international law applies

1557
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,119
which is the second and the more complex

1558
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,079
question

1559
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,280
in the analysis

1560
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
in this presentation in the paper i do

1561
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,520
not argue for a ban

1562
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,079
on autonomous weapons i do not argue for

1563
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,640
a moratorium on autonomous weapons i do

1564
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,960
not argue for new rules on autonomous

1565
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,599
weapons it's just a very narrow question

1566
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,920
under existing law which is what are the

1567
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
legal consequences when a party to

1568
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,440
conflict initiates an attack and there

1569
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,400
is an unintended outcome

1570
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,480
now this takes us directly into the

1571
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,680
second part of the presentation the law

1572
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,599
we talked about factual uncertainties

1573
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,040
now we transition towards legal

1574
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,839
uncertainties

1575
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,640
illegal uncertainties even though we

1576
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,079
have had the law of armed conflict for a

1577
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,480
very long time still reside within the

1578
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,400
elements of many rules and there is

1579
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,440
still

1580
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,040
a significant interpretative

1581
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,520
disagreement over not just definitions

1582
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,040
and standards but also even the very

1583
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,119
existence of certain elements within

1584
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,680
those rules

1585
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,079
now this is not great why is it not

1586
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,319
great because of course having clarity

1587
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,119
on the law allows parties to shape their

1588
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,040
conduct

1589
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,880
if we're unsure about what is required

1590
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,799
of parties to conflict this has

1591
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,400
implications for what we can claim is a

1592
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,319
breach and for accountability

1593
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,000
and of course this also minimizes the

1594
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,760
deterrence function

1595
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,240
of the law

1596
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,200
and very often we hear this narrative

1597
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,799
in the literature about accidents about

1598
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,880
things going wrong some abstract things

1599
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,559
for example after the august 2021 kabul

1600
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,200
attack by u.s forces we heard that there

1601
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,440
was a tragic mistake

1602
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,119
but that there was no violation of the

1603
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,119
laws of war

1604
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,480
very often there is going to be some

1605
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,160
ex-graduate compensation that is going

1606
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,839
to be given without acknowledgement of

1607
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,839
responsibility

1608
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,520
so the question is can we test that

1609
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,799
narrative

1610
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,240
can we test the narrative that

1611
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,559
unintended outcomes are not covered

1612
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,079
and in this sense i'm very happy that

1613
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,599
petra already addressed the fact that

1614
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,680
mistake of fact

1615
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,200
is not a circumstance precluding

1616
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,640
wrongfulness

1617
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,960
under international law at least within

1618
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,440
the framework of state responsibility

1619
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,200
so in this sense there are no easy

1620
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,040
answers such as to say if there is no

1621
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,359
intent there is no violation

1622
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,040
if there is a mistake of fact there is

1623
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,040
no violation we have to do the

1624
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,119
groundwork in the groundwork is go to

1625
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,640
the primary rules of the law affirmed

1626
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,480
conflict and investigate

1627
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,680
which is what we're going to be doing

1628
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,919
now

1629
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,640
we'll look at the prohibition of making

1630
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,680
civilians the object of attack

1631
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,240
which exists under both customary law

1632
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,480
and treaty law so what you have in front

1633
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
of you is additional protocol 1 article

1634
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,880
51 paragraph 2 which tells us the

1635
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,280
civilian population as such as well as

1636
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,119
individual civilians shall not be the

1637
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,359
objective attack

1638
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,440
in the paper i engage in a lengthy

1639
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,280
process of treaty interpretation but i'm

1640
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,640
afraid that i'm going to put all of you

1641
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,520
to sleep if i start doing this now so

1642
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,359
what i'll do is to just draw some

1643
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,359
elements of this analysis that really

1644
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,119
led me to the conclusion

1645
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,640
with which i'll start because you don't

1646
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,799
need to go through the entire journey

1647
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,960
it is prohibited for party to conflict

1648
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,359
to launch attacks in circumstances of

1649
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,559
doubt regarding the status of a target

1650
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,280
and i see mike smiling in the first row

1651
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,140
we'll get to this

1652
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,760
[Laughter]

1653
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,680
okay so on the spectrum of

1654
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,240
interpretations as to this prohibition

1655
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,880
that you saw here

1656
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,640
we have some who argue for a purely

1657
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,040
objective approach whereby they would

1658
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,839
say

1659
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,040
if you as a party as a matter of fact

1660
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,640
direct an attack against civilians or

1661
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,040
civilian objects this is it that's all

1662
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,040
that you need so this is a purely

1663
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,040
consequence based approach

1664
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,480
then on the other hand you have those

1665
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,400
who would be arguing for intent

1666
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,599
they would say

1667
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,160
it is only the intentional direction of

1668
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,520
attack against civilians that would

1669
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,400
count such that this would cover purpose

1670
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
or knowledge

1671
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,000
where does this fit somewhere in the

1672
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,760
middle

1673
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
so this is not a purely consequence

1674
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,440
based approach

1675
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,040
and it is not only about intent so of

1676
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,799
course instances of intentional

1677
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,720
targeting will be covered but you can

1678
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,400
see here there is an additional question

1679
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,680
which is about situations of doubt

1680
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,119
now why am i saying this

1681
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,559
if we go through the rule of treaty

1682
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,880
interpretation the ordinary meaning of

1683
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,280
terms does not tell us that much in

1684
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,720
itself it does not preclude any

1685
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,319
interpretation but

1686
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,920
if we turn to the context of this

1687
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,359
provision

1688
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,839
we can first have a look at rules that

1689
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,520
contain specific subjective elements and

1690
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,040
one of them we can have find in the

1691
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,680
second sentence of article 51

1692
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,200
where we see that acts or threats of

1693
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,960
violence the primary purpose of which is

1694
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,319
to spread terror among the civilian

1695
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,960
population are prohibited and in many

1696
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,720
places of additional protocol 1 you can

1697
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
see that where the drafters intended to

1698
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,720
have subjective elements they would list

1699
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,680
them explicitly

1700
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,599
the second piece of the puzzle which is

1701
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,079
probably the most important one is the

1702
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,200
provision on grave breaches

1703
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,880
why is it important

1704
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,559
because a grave breach here is defined

1705
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,920
as

1706
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,280
what we saw in article 51 paragraph 2

1707
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,240
combined with a standard of willfulness

1708
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,200
and certain consequences

1709
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,880
willfulness has been interpreted not

1710
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,039
only in the icrc commentary but also in

1711
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,640
the jurisprudence of international

1712
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,039
tribunals as covering not only intent

1713
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,200
but also recklessness

1714
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,599
so just reasoning from this

1715
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,760
if a grave breach is the prohibition

1716
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,160
that we saw before plus willfulness then

1717
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,280
the provision itself should mean

1718
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,599
something less

1719
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,200
and then finally

1720
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,960
in interpreting this

1721
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,240
provision

1722
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,079
tribunals for individual criminal

1723
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,680
responsibility most notably the

1724
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,520
international criminal tribunal for the

1725
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,319
former yugoslavia have interpreted in

1726
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,000
that rule the presumption of civilian

1727
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,640
status

1728
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,079
why am i referring to these you would

1729
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,359
say this is about individual

1730
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,280
responsibility because in their analysis

1731
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,640
they were interpreting that rule of

1732
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,880
international humanitarian law before

1733
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,039
proceeding to the other elements

1734
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,440
for the war crime

1735
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,880
so based on these three factors plus of

1736
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
course this is confirmed by the object

1737
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,119
and purpose from which we can derive a

1738
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,400
protection from the dangers of military

1739
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,640
operations for civilians

1740
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,880
i say that this

1741
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,400
leads us

1742
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,480
to this conclusion on scope

1743
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:22,079
how is this operationalizing practice

1744
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,839
when we think about human decision

1745
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,319
making by reference to the construction

1746
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,480
of targets of attack

1747
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,720
we're thinking about information

1748
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,280
generation in ways in which you get

1749
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,680
information about the status of a target

1750
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,440
you verify the reliability of your

1751
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,680
sources if need be you get more

1752
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,400
information you test biases within the

1753
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,720
process so you try to make sure that

1754
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,039
you're forming an accurate picture of

1755
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,359
reality as to what you're about to

1756
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,119
attack so this is typically something

1757
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,400
that happens within a human factor

1758
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,799
of the party to conflict and one good

1759
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,720
example of how this should work and

1760
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,480
should work in practice is when we

1761
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,760
consider the

1762
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,880
march 2022 attack against the marple

1763
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,359
theater

1764
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,680
if you remember civilians had inscribed

1765
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,280
deity

1766
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,039
on both sides

1767
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,880
of that building

1768
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,440
why deti means children

1769
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,599
so they were trying to alert their

1770
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,200
children who are hiding in that building

1771
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,039
now for a human

1772
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,559
this is going to entail certain

1773
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,240
consequences you think that there is at

1774
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,920
least a risk that what you're thinking

1775
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,839
of attacking shelters

1776
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,279
personhood to be protected

1777
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,039
on that occasion it seemed there was

1778
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,280
either carelessness or malice when it

1779
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,720
was constructed

1780
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,039
but the idea of having these signifiers

1781
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,000
is that there is going to be an

1782
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,839
additional information generation

1783
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,760
process such that you can make sure that

1784
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,799
the status of your target is in fact

1785
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,280
lawful

1786
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,839
with autonomous weapon systems

1787
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,640
much of this process can be transferred

1788
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,119
to the machines why because certain

1789
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,640
functions of selection engagement of

1790
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,160
targets are not going to be in the hands

1791
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,160
of human decision makers as they

1792
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,000
traditionally may have been but they're

1793
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,559
going to go to a weapon system even

1794
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,559
though there is a degree of control at

1795
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,240
the level of programming as to how

1796
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,200
they're going to operate

1797
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,960
they have sensors

1798
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,559
they gather data

1799
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,960
they have processing systems they have

1800
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,319
algorithms

1801
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,960
and all of these have to be tested

1802
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,200
individuals have to be trained on them

1803
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,480
such that there is going to be an

1804
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,760
insurance that they're going to be

1805
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,839
acting the way in which the party itself

1806
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,359
has to be acting by reference to

1807
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,200
protective needs

1808
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,319
so this is really the bottom line

1809
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,280
of what i'm getting at by combining this

1810
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,920
legal legal prohibition with

1811
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,000
autonomous weapon systems when a

1812
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,480
commander or operator is deploying an

1813
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,640
autonomous system that can independently

1814
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,280
select and engage targets

1815
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,480
the way in which that system selects the

1816
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,400
objective is part and parcel of the

1817
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,119
method in which the party to conflict

1818
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,559
is constructing the objects of attack

1819
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,799
such that if you have not programmed the

1820
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,799
presumption of doubt if you have not

1821
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,799
made sure there is good verification

1822
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,039
mechanisms it cannot be said that you're

1823
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,640
really complying with your application

1824
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,640
as a party to conflict that ought to

1825
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,680
protect

1826
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,160
civilians

1827
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,000
and then finally

1828
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,039
a way forward

1829
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,440
as you can see there is a lot that goes

1830
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,920
into this that is related to information

1831
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,440
to available information to how

1832
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,920
information is being generated

1833
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,280
and there are obligations under

1834
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,440
international humanitarian law that bind

1835
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,039
parties to conflict to take certain

1836
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,160
measures

1837
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,599
some of these are precautionary

1838
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,920
obligations such as target verification

1839
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,240
we have obligations to

1840
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,119
do legal reviews of new weapons so all

1841
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,880
of these obligations are obligations

1842
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
that generate knowledge about the

1843
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,559
systems that we're employing about

1844
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,839
targets about the deployment

1845
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,319
environment and this is why through

1846
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,280
fortifying these obligations

1847
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,920
we can get a bigger pool of information

1848
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,440
by which we're going to be assessing the

1849
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,880
decision-making of the parties to

1850
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,160
conflict

1851
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,559
there is already an understanding by

1852
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,480
states who participate in the group of

1853
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,160
governmental experts on autonomous

1854
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,480
weapons systems that these procedural

1855
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,640
obligations are really important

1856
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,799
and you can see this across the board it

1857
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,640
is not just the non-aligned movement for

1858
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,319
example that has been arguing for banned

1859
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,599
moratorium

1860
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,799
but it is even the u.s the uk

1861
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,240
who are saying that procedures are going

1862
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,440
to be key in ensuring safety of these

1863
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,359
systems

1864
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,440
available information is really shaping

1865
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,599
our expectations

1866
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,760
and this is why the hope is that by

1867
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,079
having these information generators with

1868
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,160
us in our arsenal

1869
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,760
they're going to feed into the

1870
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,480
decision-making of parties and we're

1871
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,079
going to minimize the risks of

1872
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,480
unintended harm of the of those that we

1873
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,799
ought to protect in war

1874
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,480
so really what this is is just a call

1875
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,119
for more and better information in the

1876
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,880
way in which parties

1877
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,960
make their decisions in conflict

1878
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,359
thank you

1879
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,759
thank you to atelina and thank you also

1880
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,000
for highlighting the role of information

1881
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,080
in generating information and what legal

1882
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,399
implications this has and also for

1883
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,759
sticking to the time which i really

1884
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,080
appreciate we have about 20 minutes left

1885
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,679
in the session and you know how the

1886
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,520
moderators always start by saying i'm

1887
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,279
going to abuse the privilege of being

1888
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,439
moderate i'm not going to do that unless

1889
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,359
we don't have any questions in the

1890
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,040
audience which i find hard to believe

1891
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,960
because we had three really thought

1892
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,399
provoking presentations so with that you

1893
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,279
know

1894
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,520
i would encourage you to raise your hand

1895
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,158
if you already have a question is there

1896
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,560
anyone in the audience okay i see asaf

1897
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,399
in the front row do we have more just so

1898
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,080
that we already know there will be

1899
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,759
another one in the gentleman in the back

1900
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:00,719
okay

1901
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,319
so thank you so much my question is

1902
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,439
about

1903
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,158
it's vetolina i thought was a terrific

1904
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,399
and mind-boggling presentation and

1905
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,759
i'm really looking forward to reading

1906
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,000
the full chapter um

1907
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,600
i have um

1908
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,198
an interest in getting more of your

1909
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,640
insight into

1910
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,479
some of the phraseology you used in

1911
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,640
particular the word doubt and how you

1912
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,600
conceptualize that word

1913
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,439
even before we need to complicate the

1914
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,158
matter further with autonomous systems

1915
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:29,759
we can start with

1916
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,080
intelligence use in the context of these

1917
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,839
operations and i've been thinking a lot

1918
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,600
about faulty intelligence and conducts

1919
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,839
of aerial strikes and so

1920
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,560
to what extent does the use of what is

1921
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,960
sub-optimal intelligence in deciding a

1922
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,198
particular military operation one that

1923
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,679
should be deemed as a doubt that should

1924
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,759
therefore result in the operation being

1925
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:50,880
dismissed

1926
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,679
and

1927
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,000
are those just ultimately

1928
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,360
probabilistic analyses that are

1929
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,600
percentage-wise determined and that

1930
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,280
militaries could always move away from

1931
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,199
saying well we didn't know

1932
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,440
but um that was the intelligence we had

1933
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,600
at the time and we need to make

1934
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,120
decisions on the basis of something and

1935
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,560
that's the only available information we

1936
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,159
can have

1937
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,840
so maybe before you answer let's take

1938
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,199
also the second question i think we

1939
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,280
already have the microphone in the back

1940
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,040
yes and is there anyone else okay and

1941
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,800
then mike so we take these three and

1942
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,400
then i let you all answer and then we

1943
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,239
see how much more time we have please

1944
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,000
all right so my question was also for

1945
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,400
seth felina uh my question was do you

1946
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,880
think that in a hypothetical situation

1947
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,280
where an autonomous weapon is

1948
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,120
employed by a commander and it

1949
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,960
unintentionally targets or it does

1950
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,199
target a non-combatant

1951
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,880
do you believe just based on your

1952
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,560
research that the rengelic principle is

1953
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,920
still applicable in that sort of

1954
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,040
situation

1955
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,920
or is the application of the autonomous

1956
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,280
weaponry

1957
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,840
does that begin to erode

1958
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,719
the

1959
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,080
distinction there

1960
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
for the commander thank you

1961
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,320
thank you and we also have a question

1962
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,520
from mike

1963
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,239
professor schmidt

1964
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,560
it comes as no surprise that my question

1965
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,400
is for you as well i when you were doing

1966
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,199
your research were you able to identify

1967
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,920
any country at all in their military

1968
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,800
manual that took your position that a

1969
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
mistake of fact meant that there was a

1970
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,360
violation of ihl and were you able to

1971
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,840
identify any country that actually goes

1972
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,640
to war that took the position that any

1973
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,600
doubt whatsoever precluded executing the

1974
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,880
attack

1975
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,400
okay so we have three questions for

1976
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,640
svetlina so it's not unfair to our

1977
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,719
co-panelists let me and we'll give

1978
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,640
sertalina a little bit of time to think

1979
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,320
about the order in which you take them

1980
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
you'll be the first one to answer okay

1981
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,239
but i'm going to post two questions to

1982
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,840
our co-panelists just so that we have a

1983
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,000
bit more discussion going so petra when

1984
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,840
i was listening to your paper i was

1985
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
thinking okay you have identified this

1986
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,760
legal gap right so deceptive

1987
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,520
misattribution it leads really to a gap

1988
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,520
in our understanding in the law so

1989
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,440
that's a problem so what would be a

1990
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,960
solution i want to push you on this a

1991
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,640
little bit lex ferenda you know now you

1992
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,800
have free range what rules would you

1993
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,440
propose that would address this how do

1994
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,000
we modify the current legal framework in

1995
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,920
an effective way to deal with this

1996
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,159
problem just if you have any any ideas

1997
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,520
on that and arun on yours i i think you

1998
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,120
know by showing us these new methods of

1999
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,600
effectively monitoring modern networks i

2000
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,679
hope i can say that and that it reflects

2001
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,320
uh the the crux of the argument you have

2002
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,360
shown how the scope of the obligation of

2003
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,159
due diligence can be enhanced in certain

2004
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:35,600
uh situations but could we say that the

2005
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,320
availability of these new methods also

2006
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,640
triggers a new standalone obligation in

2007
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,120
other words the fact that states might

2008
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,800
have these autonomous threat detection

2009
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,280
systems at their disposal means they

2010
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,600
must use them because it's feasible you

2011
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,360
know from the ihl perspective for

2012
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,120
example so it becomes a passive

2013
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,560
precaution something they must do to

2014
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,960
minimize civilian harm or when we are in

2015
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
the peacetime situations perhaps again

2016
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,280
it would be a standalone due diligence

2017
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,960
obligation on those states that can

2018
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,320
afford it because i know you make that

2019
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,000
point in the paper that it's a question

2020
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,760
of affordability but those things that

2021
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,920
can afford it actually must do so so

2022
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,360
that would be my question for you but

2023
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,080
let's start with catalina

2024
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
thank you so much for three excellent

2025
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,239
questions i think i can probably combine

2026
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,960
asap's question with mike's question and

2027
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,480
then turn to the one on the rand lit

2028
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,600
rule

2029
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,040
on the question of

2030
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,199
doubt

2031
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,120
the question is how do we construct

2032
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,600
doubt and a starting point for this is

2033
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,120
to say that at least in the

2034
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,960
jurisprudence of international tribunals

2035
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
it has been looked through an objective

2036
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,760
lens so it is not about the subjective

2037
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,920
beliefs of attackers but we're looking

2038
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,239
at what a reasonable person this

2039
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,920
imaginary figure that we really like

2040
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,000
talking about in law would have done in

2041
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,800
the prevailing circumstances at the time

2042
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,320
which goes back to the question of what

2043
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,640
information you had now the second

2044
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,719
question from this is this does not not

2045
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,360
tell us much about what doubt means

2046
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,560
exactly

2047
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,120
there are some views that doubt means

2048
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,520
certainty there is no one who argues

2049
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,800
that it means absolute certainty

2050
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,040
so there is the additional question of

2051
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,440
what degrees of certainty are we

2052
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,760
thinking about

2053
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,159
whether we can think about something

2054
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,000
that ties us to a notion of

2055
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,880
reasonableness for example and what this

2056
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,520
reasonableness would even mean what is

2057
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,280
clear is that you need some affirmative

2058
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,760
evidence on the status why because of

2059
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,400
the very way in which we define

2060
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,199
um civilians and civilian objects in a

2061
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,280
residual way from what we have about the

2062
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,440
lawful military objective so we have to

2063
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,120
have some affirmative evidence that

2064
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,679
there is a lawful military objective

2065
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,199
and then the question is how this

2066
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,000
evidence that we have relates to how

2067
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,960
certain we are about the nature of a

2068
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,880
target and i know that mike has written

2069
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,719
about this john mariam has written about

2070
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,000
this so there are many people who have

2071
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,159
looked at this question of how do we

2072
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,239
think about doubt is this about

2073
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,159
reasonableness is there a formulae

2074
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,000
behind this this is a question of

2075
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,560
certainty i would say that there is no

2076
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,920
problem with the formulation of

2077
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,920
certainty as such if we accept it it's

2078
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,600
not about absolute certainty but that

2079
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,239
there are gradations of certainty

2080
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,239
and ultimately it's about the question

2081
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,400
of careful and diligent decision making

2082
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,360
how you construct your targets to attack

2083
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,120
so to your question mike which is

2084
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,560
related to this one and which was about

2085
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,400
states practice the way in which states

2086
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,760
interpret

2087
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,679
the prohibitions themselves and whether

2088
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,199
they interpret this rule of doubt or

2089
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,520
mistake of fact within them

2090
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,840
now a first just methodological question

2091
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,880
is to say that when we think about

2092
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,800
what states say

2093
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,280
this may play various functions what

2094
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,040
they say and they do it may play a

2095
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,760
function in customary international law

2096
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,000
in the development of a specific rule

2097
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,520
and it can play a role in treaty

2098
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,280
interpretation but if we think about

2099
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,120
subsequent practice it will be

2100
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,040
subsequent practice that would be

2101
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,800
establishing agreement on the

2102
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,199
interpretation of a rule so if our

2103
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,440
treaty analysis shows

2104
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,400
that

2105
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,480
the rule of doubt is to be interpreted

2106
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,679
in and that we do not require intent

2107
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,440
then we would have to show that there is

2108
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,920
agreement in state practice that changes

2109
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,320
that for us to be able to say that we

2110
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,120
even need to consider individual

2111
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,600
pronouncements as determinative

2112
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,480
now do states say that doubt is to be

2113
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,880
interpreted in the rule

2114
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,880
what they typically do is to just

2115
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,560
restate the formulation of additional

2116
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,520
protocol one there are states that say

2117
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,920
that it is only about intent the uk and

2118
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,159
the us being prime examples here but

2119
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,560
again these are two states within a wide

2120
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,080
pool of states that are just repeating

2121
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,159
the formulation of the protocol and

2122
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,679
ultimately it's about the question of

2123
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,719
seeing what this protocol means within

2124
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,560
the terms of the protocol within its

2125
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,679
context and object and purpose and just

2126
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,280
a very brief point because i think it's

2127
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,520
quite interesting that in debates within

2128
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,960
u.s congress

2129
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,640
when they were thinking about additional

2130
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,840
protocol one they were actually

2131
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,600
objecting to the fact that the rule of

2132
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,320
doubt implies a standard of certainty so

2133
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,600
it's interesting but that by even

2134
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,120
rejecting that

2135
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
idea of this rule they implicitly

2136
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,040
affirmed that there is a degree of

2137
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,199
certainty within the way in which the

2138
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,440
protocol is constructed

2139
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,520
and then the third question which is

2140
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,120
also excellent

2141
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,760
so even if in the rendering we were

2142
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,600
thinking about honest mistakes it is

2143
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,520
still it was still constructed in the

2144
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,080
way in which the tribunal looked at it

2145
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,080
we threw a substitution of the tribunal

2146
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,840
in the shoes of the person in the

2147
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,760
circumstances at the time which actually

2148
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,000
aligns with what i'm saying which is

2149
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,880
that it's not about honest mistakes this

2150
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,280
is not a way to get out of this but it's

2151
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,040
about thinking

2152
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,159
of what you had available at the time

2153
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,400
and what a reasonable attacker in your

2154
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,719
circumstances would have done

2155
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,560
now as we discussed by reference to

2156
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,159
assaf's question this is exactly what

2157
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,159
needs unpacking

2158
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,960
and this may need unpacking in a

2159
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,159
compartmentalized way depending on the

2160
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,400
types of capabilities you're using so

2161
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,000
this may mean something different now

2162
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,600
that we have autonomous weapons that it

2163
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,719
meant

2164
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,280
without them i hope this answers all

2165
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,560
three

2166
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,159
thank you vettelina you want to start a

2167
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,159
room editor can i kind of connect you

2168
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,840
have a good finger on that okay go ahead

2169
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,920
does that mean swetlina that algorithms

2170
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,679
will be subject to review i mean so i've

2171
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,120
talked about intelligence as the basis

2172
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,199
of collection right uh would states be

2173
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,719
willing to open up say proprietary

2174
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,480
algorithms that underpin these weapon

2175
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,239
systems and say you know you have to

2176
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,480
show us that there is this degree of

2177
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
reasonableness that reasonableness of

2178
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
doubt that um

2179
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,239
reasonable doubt that you are you're

2180
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,640
crossing is that something that would

2181
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,040
yes absolutely so if

2182
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,280
if you as a party to conflict need to

2183
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,880
show that you have respected the rule of

2184
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,719
doubt then you have to show that what

2185
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,120
you're deploying to operationalize that

2186
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,159
principle is compliant with it in that

2187
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,679
sense this is going to raise of course

2188
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,679
questions of confidential information

2189
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,199
what you may not want to share but

2190
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,520
you'll have to show some evidence that

2191
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,960
in the programming of this this

2192
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,560
algorithm you did to comply with the

2193
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,560
rule but you're not going to get out of

2194
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,679
your country by asking another one

2195
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,120
now it's your turn and then we'll go to

2196
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,640
bed okay uh so i think uh um honestly i

2197
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,840
don't think

2198
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,920
states would commit themselves to an

2199
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,520
obligation that they should that they

2200
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,080
must you know even if the the technology

2201
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,679
that i'm talking about you know it's not

2202
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,920
quantum or anything all it requires you

2203
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,679
know basically a few lines of code and

2204
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,520
the computing resources and i think most

2205
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,120
states in the world have access to those

2206
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,800
computing resources or if not the

2207
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,400
ability to offload those computing

2208
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,960
resources to some major companies and

2209
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,719
with the question really is with respect

2210
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,040
to ihl i'm not not an expert so i think

2211
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,960
you would know this better than me so i

2212
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,239
don't want to get in there and sound

2213
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,880
stupid but i would uh just say you know

2214
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,560
we should weigh the consequences of a

2215
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,600
state of of states um you know of taking

2216
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,239
states in that direction uh these atd

2217
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,159
applications are not going to be

2218
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,600
implemented by states for the sole

2219
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,000
purpose of their cyber due diligence

2220
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,520
it's going to be for bread and butter

2221
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,760
national security cyber security do we

2222
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,199
really want governments to engage in

2223
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:08,880
deep packet inspection because a lot of

2224
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,560
governments would engage in department

2225
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,400
inspection maybe some for the right

2226
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,080
reasons some for the wrong reasons

2227
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,840
increasingly even dns communications uh

2228
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
are encrypted you know you have you know

2229
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,960
you've heard dns over https um

2230
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,880
something called quick that uh chrome

2231
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,360
uses today most dns communications not

2232
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,199
just the content but even the

2233
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,440
the header of the packets is encrypted

2234
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,360
you would have to break that encryption

2235
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,440
or you have to inspect those packets to

2236
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,080
to detect where threats come from and i

2237
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,600
think that's fair game but you do you

2238
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,760
really want all states to engage in deep

2239
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,239
space deep packet inspection um

2240
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,159
especially those that have a track

2241
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:49,040
record of violating uh human rights so

2242
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,719
you know i think it would be tough to

2243
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,040
say that an obligation a specific

2244
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,199
obligation would emerge out of this but

2245
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,120
it would be great if the

2246
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,520
um stand-alone or the due diligence

2247
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,320
application can be sort of actualized to

2248
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,840
its fullest sense with the help of the

2249
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,760
app and that's really the objective

2250
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,520
thank you aaron

2251
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,920
thank you for this question actually i

2252
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,360
believe that maybe there are free

2253
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,679
avenues where the law could develop

2254
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,400
given the fact that our hypothesis are

2255
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,520
correct that there is indeed a gap

2256
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,760
i think that on on one level there could

2257
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,480
be a primary norm developed that

2258
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,320
generally prohibits such an activity

2259
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,960
which has the sole intent of

2260
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,560
causing a dispute between another two

2261
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,719
countries so not only deception

2262
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,239
deception and misattribution but

2263
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,400
generally this kind of let's say provo

2264
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,719
provocation or aggression

2265
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,880
uh that could be one hand the question

2266
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,679
is how to do that another level where

2267
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,679
the law could develop maybe is the level

2268
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:46,800
of

2269
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,880
responsibility where we could maybe

2270
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,199
develop fourth ground of derived

2271
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,199
responsibility just perfectly fitting

2272
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,199
this situation so when the state is

2273
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,040
actually

2274
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,639
frauded into commission of

2275
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,080
internationally wrongful act against

2276
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,400
victim state that could be also

2277
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,560
attributable to the actor of that

2278
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,920
operation but also that there is a

2279
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,679
question a problem that still the

2280
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,239
response of the deceived state is based

2281
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,400
on its own deliberate decision even

2282
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,400
though

2283
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,719
it's originating from

2284
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,360
fabricated facts by another subject so

2285
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,159
it's still a question a third

2286
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,040
possibility may be the development of a

2287
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,760
procedural obligation going far beyond

2288
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,159
general duty to cooperate between states

2289
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,639
in cases of debt

2290
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,639
to communicate at first before resorting

2291
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,560
to country measures or

2292
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,639
another measures to the alleged

2293
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,199
wrongdoer uh to

2294
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,800
some procedure of communication but it

2295
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,000
doesn't prevent i think conflict as such

2296
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,320
we already have this uh as we discuss

2297
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,840
with my colleague we already have

2298
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
procedural obligations in another areas

2299
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,000
of international law uh in validity of

2300
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,080
treaties and termination of treaties and

2301
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,000
it still doesn't prevent that we end up

2302
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,840
with a conflict and of course

2303
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,000
if i would be the state who would like

2304
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,600
to induce

2305
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,000
his attribution by deceiving i would

2306
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,800
choose as a deceived state

2307
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
a state that has not friendly relations

2308
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,480
with the victim state

2309
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,320
so there is not probability also that

2310
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,679
they would normally communicate they

2311
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,440
would just resort back

2312
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,440
so i don't know if that answers your

2313
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,960
question that could be possibilities but

2314
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,040
we've limited maybe it answers my

2315
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,480
question but it highlights one thing

2316
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,000
that i've been thinking about while you

2317
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
were presenting and also now and that is

2318
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,840
that you didn't use the word cyber in

2319
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,840
your answer almost at all maybe maybe

2320
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,080
there was one mention of it so it makes

2321
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,159
me think to what extent is this analysis

2322
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,520
technology neutral you know that it

2323
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,199
doesn't really even matter on the fact

2324
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,440
that this misattribution happens in

2325
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,960
cyberspace

2326
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,199
would the same analysis apply to any

2327
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,199
kind of deception by one state of

2328
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,880
another that would have nothing to do

2329
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,400
with new technology of course this takes

2330
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,400
us outside of the scope of this panel

2331
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,000
but i think it's quite important for the

2332
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,239
legal analysis that you're presenting i

2333
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,000
think so i think that this scenario as

2334
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,080
well as the legal background around that

2335
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,400
could be also applicable to non-cyber

2336
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,800
context physical context i think it's

2337
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
more or less likely because cybersphere

2338
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,920
offers much more tools to concealment

2339
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,199
and deception

2340
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,840
and in the physical terms physical

2341
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,320
theatre of operations we we see the

2342
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,320
results more more more

2343
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,280
visibly and of more more immediately

2344
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,159
so

2345
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,679
this research

2346
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:26,560
really

2347
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,560
is related to cyber domain but it's also

2348
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,360
applicable to other i think that this

2349
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,520
scenario can be conducted also outside

2350
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,040
the cyber context and with the same

2351
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,199
legal problems and so maybe this is the

2352
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,800
right point to plug in the fact that

2353
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
this scenario actually arises out of a

2354
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,800
cyber scenario right yes you and martin

2355
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,719
wrote for the cyber law toolkit so those

2356
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,560
of you who are more interested in this

2357
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,960
in this topic that's where the practical

2358
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,920
kind of set of facts originates so there

2359
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,159
is certainly more on that there i was

2360
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,639
scanning the room as ah there is one

2361
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,639
more two more three more questions okay

2362
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,719
well and we have three minutes left so i

2363
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,239
will have to ask you to be quick with

2364
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,400
the questions you ask very quick it's

2365
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,400
about due diligence

2366
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,040
i was confused at your discussion of due

2367
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,679
diligence and the reason i was confused

2368
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,520
is because due diligence is usually

2369
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,480
about a third party operating from your

2370
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,679
territory and in your scenario the

2371
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,400
deceiving state it's actually the organ

2372
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,679
of the state that is acting so i didn't

2373
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,440
understand why you were raising the

2374
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,600
issue of due diligence or no harm

2375
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,320
principle as you call it at all

2376
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,080
okay well let peter think about it

2377
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,760
davide and can we also get the mic in

2378
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,440
the back or you already have it no can

2379
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,080
we send mike there david thank you okay

2380
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,480
we all know that

2381
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,080
some states uh use non-state actors to

2382
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,400
for conducting cyber operation on other

2383
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,159
states and excuse me sir who is your

2384
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,440
question for

2385
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,400
um

2386
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,000
i am warmit i'm a a phd candidate for

2387
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,880
i've

2388
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,800
visited august world and who are you

2389
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,159
asking the question to which of our

2390
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,400
panelists i think i i would ask that

2391
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,239
question for all

2392
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,840
you have to choose one if you don't mind

2393
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,440
because we're really running out of time

2394
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,440
so choose choose your preferred one uh

2395
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,400
for mr van okay yeah

2396
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,600
um

2397
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,400
yeah

2398
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,639
some states like russia use

2399
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,440
non-state actors for conducting cyber

2400
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,679
vibration on other states

2401
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,360
do you think um

2402
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,840
that new technology can make any

2403
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
difference

2404
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,400
for uh to solve this problem

2405
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,280
i mean um states

2406
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,560
use non-state actors to avoid taking the

2407
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,800
responsibility of these attacks thank

2408
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,400
you so we have a question on non-state

2409
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,400
actors and then david the final one yes

2410
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,920
very quickly a question for tevalina

2411
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,320
it's concerning the technological

2412
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,000
development and

2413
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,400
in assessing the adapt because as a

2414
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,400
matter of fact

2415
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,280
many many states could have

2416
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,520
better technology rather than other and

2417
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,600
and so how these will impact in the

2418
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,280
assessment of the

2419
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,520
available uh

2420
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,760
and available means and instruments in

2421
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,840
order to carry out a fair assessment

2422
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,600
thank you okay excellent so i will let

2423
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,360
you each answer in

2424
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,120
as briefly as you can

2425
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,719
thank you for the question professor uh

2426
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,239
we also believe that the application of

2427
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,320
the principle is very difficult in this

2428
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,320
scenario the reason why we

2429
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,400
raised that issue is that i think that

2430
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
if there is a rule that could be

2431
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,840
breached this one is the most closest

2432
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,760
maybe but the original reason is that

2433
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,639
the the very false flag operation of the

2434
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,960
deceiving state is originating from its

2435
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,040
territory and its sole purpose in our

2436
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,159
scenario is the the harmful consequences

2437
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,639
for the victim state so if we consider

2438
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,440
this original false flag operation which

2439
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,080
should motivate the the second state to

2440
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,000
actually resort uh

2441
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,560
as the harm uh then we could discuss

2442
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,080
whether yeah it originates from the

2443
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,760
territory or the deceiving state because

2444
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,679
its origins conducted did false flag

2445
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,080
operation but it's its intent was not

2446
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,800
only to to some pro to do some harm to

2447
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,199
the deceived state but to motivate him

2448
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,120
to to provoke him to respond to the

2449
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,000
victim state so but we we still

2450
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
see that there is a big difficulty with

2451
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,600
application of that principle

2452
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,360
i think the early question was on

2453
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,120
non-state actors i think with respect to

2454
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,120
due diligence the only i mean there's no

2455
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,199
need to attribute it to uh the state

2456
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,960
this only question is whether the state

2457
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,800
has actual or constructive knowledge uh

2458
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,440
that's the only uh operational factor of

2459
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,560
the the due diligence uh principle so in

2460
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,440
that sense um what the atd application

2461
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,560
that i spoke about does is it gives the

2462
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,159
state

2463
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,920
a more comprehensive you know

2464
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,679
comprehensive visibility over various

2465
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,199
aspects of its network

2466
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,040
doesn't matter which non-state actor it

2467
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,800
is because it breaks it down into layers

2468
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,480
abstracts into okay this is a cloud you

2469
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,360
know this is a provider of

2470
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,440
cloud services in my territory and these

2471
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,560
are the kind of threats that are

2472
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,639
originating from it or this is you know

2473
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,800
if cloudflare runs operation on my

2474
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,280
territory and there is a bgp hijacking

2475
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,800
that's going on okay this is happening

2476
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,239
and cloudflare is in a position to know

2477
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:10,239
and tell me and so you know these

2478
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,760
applications can be developed by the

2479
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,800
private sector as well as governments uh

2480
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,560
and of course private that applications

2481
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,639
that are developed by the private sector

2482
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,560
give instantaneous knowledge to those

2483
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,480
actors but also to the state so in that

2484
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,280
sense that's the modest link that i make

2485
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,960
thank you arun and sir telina very

2486
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,840
briefly

2487
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,199
thank you that's that's an excellent

2488
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,800
question intuitively the answer should

2489
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,360
be yes right the law should accommodate

2490
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,679
these differences when we think about

2491
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,840
precautionary obligations it does

2492
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,239
through the loop of feasibility of

2493
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,679
precautionary measures but then the

2494
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,679
question is the rule of doubt does not

2495
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,719
seem to accommodate such flexibility

2496
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,199
like precautions so there are probably

2497
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,120
two ways to address this one of them is

2498
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,719
when we think about construction of

2499
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,040
doubt that perhaps one factor can also

2500
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,520
be some kind of available means for you

2501
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,840
to determine the status of a target or

2502
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,520
the second one would be when we think

2503
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,239
about the reasonable person in the shoes

2504
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:06,560
of that decision maker at the time maybe

2505
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
the reasonable person standard is going

2506
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,320
to be altered on the basis of what

2507
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,880
exactly you have as capacities to

2508
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,600
identify targets so this these are the

2509
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,040
two conceptual ways in which i think

2510
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,199
that the concern that you raise could be

2511
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,920
looped in the legal standard

2512
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,840
thank you so much so you know you see we

2513
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,520
have exhausted the time but we haven't

2514
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,360
exhausted the topics and we certainly

2515
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,960
haven't exhausted the speakers so feel

2516
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,800
free to come to them during the coffee

2517
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,480
break i think this one is very short

2518
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,320
because the next panel starts in like 10

2519
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,400
minutes so we have to end here could we

2520
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,679
have a huge round of applause for our

2521
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,000
wonderful speakers
