1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,480
thank you thank you for such a kind

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,840
introduction

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
we all know that from ukraine to the

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,599
transition to the cloud from

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
operational security to threat

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,240
intelligence

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,679
from

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,160
what we're discussing here today

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,960
to conversations about norm creations so

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760
that they're practically applicable

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,480
their role of international tech giants

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,599
cannot be overestimated

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,520
moving forward they're the ones who in

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
very practical terms and i say that as a

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
government official

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,399
laid the tracks for technological

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,320
futures in terms of

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
how our citizens

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
and therefore so governments and

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
organizations

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
live our very digital lives

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
therefore it's such a pleasure to be on

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,280
the stage together with casper

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
who speaks to all of that that microsoft

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,680
across europe

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
and in a true spirit of this dedication

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
to dialogue

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,360
he's allowed me to approach the stage

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
stressed as the ukrainian national flag

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,330
so

31
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,680
[Applause]

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,159
that also means

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,479
i'm not starting a second career as a

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,920
stand-up comedian

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
but that also means that we very much

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
invite questions from the audience

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
i'll give the florida casper for a few

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
minutes for opening remarks and then

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
whilst we have plenty of questions to

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
fill them

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,320
you know the day before lunch break

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
would you invite questions from the

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
audience as well

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
good well first of all thanks very much

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
lisa it's it's a it's an honor to be on

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,240
stage with you we're here and it's great

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
to be in thailand it's great to be at

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
cycon

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,320
um

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
you know a small secret before we uh

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
before we came into the room we sort of

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
said why don't we make this a little bit

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
more of a dialogue rather than sort of a

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
keynote speech and a couple of questions

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280
afterwards and i think you also promised

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
me lisa it would only be easy questions

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,799
when we open up to the floor so we

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
should we should keep to that

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,520
and but listen i i i'm really happy to

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
be here at the of course a critical

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
moment not least for those of us living

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,200
in europe but i think also at a critical

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
moment

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
when we talk about cyber security writ

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,319
large but also as we talk about the role

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
or indeed the collaboration between the

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
private sector and the public sector

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,800
i have a past

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
i'll refrain from saying whether it's a

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
dark past or bright past and working for

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
for government uh for nato for the

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
european union before moving over to the

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
private sector and working for for

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,160
microsoft so

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
i will i will pretend at least i

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
understand uh you know how that

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
relationship looks from uh from both

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
sides

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
but needless to say you you brought the

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
uh the word into the conversation

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
already said it's difficult to talk

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
about anything these days without

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,959
looking at what is happening in ukraine

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
and of course the the unjustified and

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
unlawful wall that is is currently

86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
ripping through ukraine

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,440
and i began my own career in in the

88
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
balkans bank in the in the 90s

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
and and like many others i i honestly

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
did not think you would see

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,879
you know traditional warfare in europe

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
again after what we saw in the balkans

93
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,879
so to see this in ukraine

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
is um is devastating on so many levels

95
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,519
but of course as many of the previous

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
speakers today have also

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
said and underlined you know this is

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
really a war where we see

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
uh you know the hybrid dimension coming

100
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,799
into full play we see kinetic activities

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
on the ground but of course we also see

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
a massive cyber security

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
attack being played out in

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
in the virtual world and

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
although there has been many examples of

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
that in the past i think we haven't seen

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
it at the scale that we have seen in in

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
ukraine and if i fast forward to some of

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
the difficult questions i'm sure you're

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
going to be asking this is

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
what what does that mean for companies

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
like microsoft or other players in the

113
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
cyber security domain or technology

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,000
companies in a bigger scale and i think

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
the answer is

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,400
it's a difficult situation to handle it

117
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
was difficult before the 24th of

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
february it's been difficult since the

119
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
24th of february but i think it's also

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,879
fair to say there is sort of a

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,280
pre-ukraine and a post-ukraine

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
in the necessity of the private sector

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
to be on the right side of history to

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
fundamentally protect democracy human

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,759
rights

126
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
institutions critical infrastructure and

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
that's certainly the approach that we've

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
been taking in microsoft as well

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
perhaps before diving a little bit more

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
into green just a couple of words again

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
previous speakers have mentioned this

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
already

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
i think it is incredibly important to

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
focus on the lessons that we can draw

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,479
from ukraine

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
but i think it is also important as many

137
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
of you in the audience will know better

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
than i that of course ukraine is one

139
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,479
example um out of many and what we are

140
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,479
seeing in a global scale is of course an

141
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,680
unprecedented level of cyber security

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
attacks being launched i think we are

143
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
seeing an increased

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
degree of sophistication in those

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
attacks and as we've definitely also

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
seen ukraine

147
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
a lot of focus on destructive activities

148
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
not only ransomware malware with the

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
intent of trying to extract financial

150
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
opportunities we're really seeing an

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,680
increased focus on hitting critical

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,199
infrastructure we're seeing an increased

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
focus on crippling

154
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,759
institutional setups or in this case

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,440
governments

156
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,280
what it did for us at an early stage was

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
you know years ago a decision taken to

158
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
become quite transparent and quite open

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
about the threat picture that we see

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,440
globally so we've published

161
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,199
numerous reports over the years where we

162
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
actually call out

163
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,400
you know the kind of attacks we're

164
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
seeing but also the geographic

165
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
places that these attacks are

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
originating from

167
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,759
and it's difficult to be

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
super positive when you look at data

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
sets that indicates an increase in

170
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
number of attacks and also an increase

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
in the degree of sophistication and i

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
think this is where ukraine is hopefully

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,479
um a game changer in bringing the

174
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,080
private and the public sector closer

175
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
together so government and and the

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
private sector and acknowledging that we

177
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
have to work much closer together

178
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
whether we like it or not a company like

179
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,479
microsoft like many other companies are

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,919
front line

181
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
operators in trying to mitigate those

182
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,560
attacks protecting our customers whether

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
they're private or public protecting

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
critical infrastructure

185
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
we have i think both a business

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,039
responsibility but also a moral and

187
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,000
ethical responsibility to doing so

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
but i think there is also an

189
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
acknowledgement that this cannot happen

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
without a closer collaboration with the

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
public sector and in many ways i think

192
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,039
that's where we are finding ourselves

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
now the last point before i'm shutting

194
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,720
up lisa at least to begin with is i know

195
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
um

196
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,919
david from david van beale from from

197
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,680
nato i'm not sure whether david is still

198
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
in the room um but a good friend

199
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
the asg for foundation he spoke earlier

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
today also about the kind of

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,199
work that is happening inside nato under

202
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,479
his leadership

203
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
work that we find incredibly important

204
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
also in microsoft in an area where we've

205
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,160
been trying to support

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,199
nato

207
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
the best we can

208
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,199
and i'm not sure whether we spoke a lot

209
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
about the upcoming

210
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
summit in in madrid but if i may just

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
put in a little bit of a provocative

212
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
statement here in in the introduction is

213
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,280
to say that i'm really hoping that we

214
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
will see at the nato summit in madrid

215
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
and also in the new strategic concept

216
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,880
a an opportunity for nato to work closer

217
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
together with a private sector

218
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,240
i think whether we look at cyber

219
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
security attacks or emerging and

220
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
disruptive technologies ai quantum etc

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
i think if nothing else then the current

222
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
situation towards the east has shown the

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520
need for us to work closer together but

224
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
frankly speaking also the need for the

225
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
private sector to acknowledge that we

226
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
have an incredibly important role to

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
play in supporting the alliance in

228
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,199
making sure that we are defending

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
democracy defending human rights

230
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
including with the technology that we

231
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,319
develop and deploy so fingers crossed

232
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
we'll see a couple of um of sentences

233
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,440
both in the summit the conclusions but

234
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
also in the new strategy concept about

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
what we can do to work together we're

236
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
ready to do that

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
thank you and and so much to pick up on

238
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,440
here so we'll keep this

239
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,199
we'll kick this conversation off and as

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
i said if you can indicate from the

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,919
audience

242
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
if you have questions

243
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
i think the last time

244
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
we all met as five to seven hundred

245
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
people in tallinn for cycan

246
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,958
none of us would have imagined that

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,159
almost all of the opening keynotes talk

248
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
about transparency

249
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,958
we lived in a world where the

250
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,710
belief in

251
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,800
[Music]

252
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
it's it was sort of the world of

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
mutually assured doubt in cyber security

254
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
and now almost every single keynote has

255
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
highlighted and emphasized the need for

256
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,279
transparency and and i think you are now

257
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
we were in particular mentioned that

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
that's a pragmatic choice to be made it

259
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
makes sense to talk about what you're

260
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
doing

261
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
so

262
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
microsoft similarly spoke very openly of

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
wipers that you were seeing

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
both leading up to february 24th and

265
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
then the week after

266
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,959
with

267
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
quite precise technical detail

268
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
some would argue more that never never

269
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,760
been seen before

270
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
so

271
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
what do you

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
where do you see that

273
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,399
element of our conversations going

274
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
and partially know what's your

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
hard sell to make sure that we keep

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
going

277
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
in the direction of transparency

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,519
yeah listen i think it's it's a great

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
question and again i know everybody in

280
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
the audience is is very much

281
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
knowledgeable in this area but

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
if if i may

283
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
just tell a small anecdote that goes

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
back um

285
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
five years

286
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
on the 27th of june 2017

287
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
as many will remember we had the not

288
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,079
patchy attack

289
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
and i was actually working for for the

290
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
government um the danish government in

291
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
in jakarta indonesia when this attack

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
hit one of the biggest danish companies

293
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,240
uh no secrets here it was mersk the

294
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
shipping company

295
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
and and i still remember how we were

296
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
working to try and help maersk in

297
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
jakarta because it basically wiped out

298
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
their their their infrastructure and

299
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
they were they were unable to

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
identify what kind of containers were

301
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,519
coming in and out of of harper but i

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
also remember very clearly

303
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
the concerns about going public in this

304
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
case for for this company but i think

305
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
the same applies for many companies that

306
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
are being attacked you know do you

307
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
actually acknowledge that you've been

308
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
under attack you share the lessons

309
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
learned or the kind of damage that have

310
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,519
been done

311
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,040
with those attacks so i think if we

312
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
begin with the transparency discussion

313
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,079
in this area

314
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,600
i don't think we can find any cyber

315
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
security strategies whether it's in the

316
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
european union or in nato that doesn't

317
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
recognize that this is a challenging

318
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,519
area but we do need more information

319
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,000
sharing and we do need to create formats

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
where that information can be shared in

321
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,920
a way that will make all parties

322
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
comfortable with it i think that's one

323
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
part of the transparency discussion the

324
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,399
other one

325
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
if we just reflect a little bit on on

326
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
our own situation

327
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
i said in the beginning i think these

328
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
are difficult and very hard choices also

329
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
for a company like microsoft

330
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
um you know do we call out publicly

331
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
that we see a number of attacks

332
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,519
originating from russia from china north

333
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
korea iran etc

334
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
is that always fantastic for for the

335
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,519
business relationship in those areas no

336
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
it's not but i think there was a very

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
deliberate decision taken in saying we

338
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
have again a moral obligation but i

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
think also a business and a customer

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,079
obligation to try and be transparent and

341
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
to share that data with the hope that

342
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
this becomes

343
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
part of the discussion so that we can

344
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
build up better resilience big

345
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,040
bigger kind of collaboration between all

346
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,639
parties that we can fight these kind of

347
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,680
attacks

348
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,079
and having worked on the government side

349
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
um i know how difficult the attribution

350
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,399
discussions are whether it's in national

351
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,160
governments or whether it's in in

352
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
international organizations but to some

353
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
extent i think what we've been doing

354
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
with the reports we put out

355
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,639
including the special report we put out

356
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
on ukraine a couple weeks ago

357
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,959
is getting very close to attribution if

358
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
you haven't read the report

359
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
i can recommend it not only because it's

360
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
a microsoft report because

361
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
but because i actually think it goes

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
very far

363
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
in also identifying the kind of links

364
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,399
also with specific services in russia

365
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
what we saw in in the in the attack

366
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,680
patterns

367
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
etc and i think that's an indication

368
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,480
that

369
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
you know the attribution discussion is

370
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,440
moving ahead

371
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
both on the private side and also on the

372
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
public side and i think that is what is

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
needed if we are going to be successful

374
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
in mitigating those attacks

375
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
i think information add one thing on on

376
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,680
ukraine

377
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
we've also been very public in saying

378
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
we've been working with ukrainian

379
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
authorities both in the lead up to the

380
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,839
24th of february but also after the 24th

381
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,480
of february we've even

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,279
you know

383
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
come public by saying we've helped

384
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,959
migrate 16 out of 17 ministries to the

385
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
cloud uh you know a service that

386
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
if you if you put a price tag on it is

387
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
probably in the vicinity of 100 million

388
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
us dollars worth of services being

389
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
provided conor moore to the ukrainian

390
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
authorities i think those kind of

391
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
examples

392
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
we think have been necessary but again

393
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,720
those are difficult things to go public

394
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,959
with but i think there is a

395
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
new situation where more more companies

396
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,160
will will

397
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
feel that that's the right thing to do

398
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
and and again a lot to pick up here but

399
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,440
you know

400
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
to speak short i'm really failing on

401
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,800
that i'm sorry we have a b clock staring

402
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
so in transition to the cloud

403
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
it's such an obvious

404
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,800
more

405
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
likely legal than technical challenge

406
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
frankly

407
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
and there's clearly the competing trends

408
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,639
or completing interests on the one hand

409
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,639
understanding that that's where

410
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,480
technology is going

411
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
and that's where the world's moving and

412
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,040
we're in the 21st century and cloud is

413
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
inevitable on the other hand

414
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
there is also

415
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
the tendency

416
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
in government

417
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
and in regulation

418
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,240
and in how we both create and and read

419
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
norms

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
to

421
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,279
believe that as long as data is inside

422
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
our perimeter

423
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,839
it's also

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,160
better protected because no it's ours

425
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,120
uh how do you see us overcoming that

426
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
sense of a false dichotomy and be

427
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
the underlying assumptions in there that

428
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
might no longer be true yeah i mean

429
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,720
first of all i think you really point to

430
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
one of the the challenges we have uh

431
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
hopefully collectively which is to

432
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
um get the message across that in in in

433
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
the virtual world putting something in

434
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
the basement in a vault is actually not

435
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,959
protecting it in in the best possible

436
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,959
way um

437
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,720
my own colleagues will will get nauseous

438
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,399
now because i will use my mother as an

439
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
example but it's extremely difficult for

440
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
me to explain to to my mother and it's

441
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
probably because of my own shortfalls

442
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
that if you want to protect data you

443
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
actually needed to to put it into the

444
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
cloud because that enables companies

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
like microsoft and and others to to

446
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,800
issue our latest cyber security suite

447
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
and the best protection we have around

448
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
one of the challenges in ukraine

449
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
as many of you know here was actually

450
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,240
that most

451
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
data was on premise you had service in

452
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
the basement extremely vulnerable to to

453
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
attacks

454
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
whether physical attacks or or cyber

455
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,560
attacks so one of the clear lessons

456
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,079
learned not only from ukraine but also

457
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,880
from previous cyber security taxes

458
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,839
you need a cloud adaptation strategy and

459
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,759
then lisa i'm sure you're going to to be

460
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
tough with me and saying do you have

461
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
commercial interest in actually

462
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,440
promoting the cloud and the answer is

463
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
yes absolutely we do have commercial

464
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,000
interest in in in promoting the cloud

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
but i will also be very honest and

466
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,880
saying and

467
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,639
if david and other colleagues for nato

468
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,240
will be in the room he will he will be

469
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
able to testify that is the truth that

470
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
we don't really care well we care a

471
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
little bit but you can take your cloud

472
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
business wherever you want but take it

473
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
somewhere

474
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
take it to a competitor

475
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,399
take it somewhere because we need to

476
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,920
make sure that as we

477
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
work together in protecting our

478
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
societies our institutions

479
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
again our

480
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
you know in this case our european uh

481
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,279
countries

482
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,720
cloud adaptation is an absolute

483
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
essential thing and i think this is

484
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
where i see the discussions changing

485
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,480
ever so gently because of what we're

486
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
seeing in ukraine both in in the

487
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,720
european union uh you know when we have

488
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,199
discussions with counterparts i see

489
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,000
a

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
slightly different approach where there

491
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
is an acknowledgement that cloud is the

492
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
foundation

493
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,839
for

494
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,679
protecting in the best possible way i

495
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
see the same happening in nato so i

496
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
think cyber security is absolutely

497
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,640
essential but if you allow me just to

498
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,359
put

499
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,359
two other reasons why cloud adaptation

500
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
is going to be essential i would also

501
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,119
point to the fact

502
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
that from a

503
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,959
sustainability point of view from an

504
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,359
energy dependency point of view

505
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,319
moving to the cloud is vastly superior

506
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
to keeping

507
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
you know on-premise service

508
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
numbers are difficult in this area but

509
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
our own estimations is that you can save

510
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
somewhere between 80 and 90 of your

511
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
energy consumption by going to the cloud

512
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
and i don't think i have to explain

513
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
anybody sitting here in in thailand and

514
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
estonia that the dependency on energy is

515
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
definitely also one of the challenges in

516
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
europe as well but then if you allow me

517
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,160
just the last point which i think is

518
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
critically important for those of us

519
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,360
that are europeans um i don't think i've

520
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,679
met any european decision maker who's

521
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,400
not deeply concerned about europe not

522
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
making it in the digital economy we're

523
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
not perhaps creating the uh

524
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
the companies uh the big unicorns or

525
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
tomorrow in the same scale as you would

526
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,240
see in north america or in asia

527
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
but i actually think that one of the

528
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
best possible ways of making sure that

529
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
europe will cut it in the digital age is

530
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
also to have a pretty aggressive

531
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
cloud adaptation strategy and the funny

532
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,799
thing is

533
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
who are who are the companies that will

534
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
benefit most from from a cloud

535
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
adaptation

536
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
you know quite often you will have it's

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
the big companies but in fact small and

538
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,760
medium-sized enterprises have a huge

539
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
return on investments because you get

540
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,679
access to state-of-the-art technology ai

541
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,960
systems

542
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
at an affordable price at a in a model

543
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
where you can scale up and scale down

544
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,200
much easier than if you have to buy

545
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
equipment for the basement but then when

546
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
outside of

547
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
you know

548
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
a wall yeah which often motivates action

549
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
i absolutely agree

550
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
if you look at the conversations there's

551
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
now many red lines drawn ranging from

552
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
cryptographic key management now will

553
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
happily and and then many national

554
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,039
regulations say we'll happily trust

555
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,760
cloud providers as long as we are both

556
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
the private and public key which then

557
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
function

558
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
seriously limits cloud functionality

559
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
since you can't do anything with what's

560
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
in the cloud it's effectively a data

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
dump

562
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
there's the conversations about

563
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
geolocation of data

564
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,200
there's conversations about

565
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,360
what you can do with data and then what

566
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
you can do with

567
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
this the information systems around your

568
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
data and the granularity of that

569
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
so

570
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
you know outside of

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
a major crisis that will propel all of

572
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
us

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
fast in one direction or another

574
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,679
where do you

575
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
see both governments and

576
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
cloud service providers

577
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
taking the next steps to to meet in the

578
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,919
middle to find the middle ground where

579
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,600
we no longer hitting each other on the

580
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,799
head with

581
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,880
key management or chair location or

582
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
whatever the you know stick to jour

583
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
happens to be

584
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,799
well i think the starting point and

585
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
that's certainly the approach we've been

586
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
trying to take in microsoft is to

587
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,360
acknowledge that those concerns are

588
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
valid that there are reasons why

589
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,080
governments have some hesitations in

590
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,919
moving to the cloud you know data

591
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,600
protection data sovereignty if you want

592
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,080
to use that word is i think top of mind

593
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
not least here in in europe

594
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
and and i think for us that actually

595
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
means

596
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
also adapting our technology to the

597
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
specific uh situation on the ground and

598
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,640
here in europe um we spoke a little bit

599
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
about it before going on stage these are

600
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
the digital sovereignty discussions of

601
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,600
course a big discussion and i think a

602
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
legitimate discussion where there are

603
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
concerns about you know will you be able

604
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,799
to protect your data whether it's

605
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
personal or industrial data if you put

606
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
it into the cloud will it be accessible

607
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
by others and i think that requires us

608
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
to work closely but frankly speaking

609
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,000
also to listen very carefully to the

610
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
concerns and make sure that the

611
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
technology we develop has the kind of

612
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,559
safety features that customers are

613
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,000
interested in again whether they are

614
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
private or public so i think that's one

615
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
thing the other thing is of course that

616
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
we have this

617
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
let's call it a regulatory freight train

618
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
coming out of brussels these days uh

619
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
perhaps less so on the nato side and and

620
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,440
very much so on on the eu side and i

621
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
think that collection of different

622
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,280
regulations

623
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
will deal very clearly of course with

624
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,240
cyber security issues privacy issues

625
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
you will have in that clear provisions

626
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
on what the technology industry will

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
need to do to be compliant and i think

628
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
not all of it will be easy for us to

629
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,200
comply with not all of it will be areas

630
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
that we will enjoy um significantly but

631
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
but those are the realities and i think

632
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,559
it will enable us fundamentally to

633
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
deliver what customers are interested in

634
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
i think we have one big advantage in in

635
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
europe and that is we've made

636
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
significant investments over the years

637
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
in building up

638
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
um you know a lot of data centers which

639
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,559
is of course the the backbone the the

640
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,480
the infrastructure backbone for the

641
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
cloud etc and that has actually also

642
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,080
enabled us to do something we call the

643
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
eu data boundary where we offer our

644
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,120
customers the possibility to store data

645
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,720
in europe but actually also to process

646
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
data in europe not something we would

647
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
not have been able to do a couple of

648
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,919
years ago and again it's because of the

649
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,679
20 billion us dollar investment we've

650
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
been making in data centers in europe

651
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
that it actually enables us to do

652
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
safety features or provisions in europe

653
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
that

654
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
i think comes a long way in addressing

655
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
some of the concerns that we're seeing

656
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
and before i push you further than that

657
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,080
then they could happily do that until

658
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
their cows come home or go home

659
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
depending on where you're sitting i see

660
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
a question in the middle there and

661
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,159
another few here so

662
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
let's see how fast the microphones

663
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
travel and just go in there right up

664
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
here i'm impressed that you can see

665
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
anything because i only see some of the

666
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,879
heavy lights here

667
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,559
hi er berenike from a ba systems digital

668
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
intelligence thank you so much for your

669
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,320
speech mr klinger it's really a pleasure

670
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
to meet you again

671
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
and this was a great talk though so

672
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
thank you i do have two questions

673
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,559
um and the first one being directed

674
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
really yet well public private

675
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
partnerships you all can't hear this

676
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,039
word anymore and transparency um

677
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,799
so we heard right now three talks in a

678
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,520
row focusing on that topic

679
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,440
and from what i perceive integrating

680
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
private sector companies

681
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
into governmental systems and

682
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,000
integrating the data from private sector

683
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
companies into governmental systems

684
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,760
comes really with two major issues so

685
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,720
private sector companies obviously

686
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,679
oftentimes use commercial off-the-shelf

687
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
components

688
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
which go along a long supply chain

689
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
and as we

690
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
all i am sure aware

691
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,279
it's well not too difficult to implement

692
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
backdoors and vulnerabilities along this

693
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
largely uncontrolled supply chain so

694
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,440
this is uh the one question or the one

695
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
issue probably so the u.s introduced the

696
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,279
cyber security majority model right but

697
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,039
uh most of the governments and

698
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
especially in europe do not have such a

699
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,240
system yet to control supply chains this

700
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
is the one hand or the one thing

701
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
and then especially if you talk about

702
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
nato and governments collaborating uh we

703
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,520
have to think about adjusting

704
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,240
classification levels right so probably

705
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
governments will have to downgrade

706
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,240
classification levels while the private

707
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
sector will have to upgrade and classify

708
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
its information a bit more

709
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,880
so

710
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,640
from both sides we will have to see a

711
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
compromise

712
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,880
and my question to you here is from from

713
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
your wide experience and the insights

714
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
you just shared

715
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,799
uh

716
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,760
what would be the technical solutions

717
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,799
and the best practices you saw to even

718
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
allow for

719
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
those compromises to happen

720
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,679
and

721
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,760
yeah to incentivize both sides

722
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
to do this compromise

723
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
and then the second question which is

724
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
also directed at mart a little bit

725
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
is

726
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,039
if we if we think about

727
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
the supply chain and if we think about

728
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
sharing cyber threat intelligence right

729
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
um

730
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
and we think about standardizing this

731
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
like from your experience again and from

732
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
your insights into the field

733
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,559
how can governments uh

734
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,279
well engage in standardizing without

735
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
restricting the private sector too much

736
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
and restricting too much the private

737
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,000
sector's ability to be agile and to be

738
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
innovative

739
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
well as this is the key point of cyber

740
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,159
security and cyber development at all

741
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,279
thank you

742
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,440
a lot you pondered there for you yeah

743
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,000
sorry and we have a seven minutes and 47

744
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
seconds and two other persons no

745
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
i i think you know

746
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
a short answer to to a lot of relevant

747
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
questions i think you're pointing to

748
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
areas where we need to listen and i was

749
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,520
trying to say that early on um i think

750
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
compromise is yes to some extent

751
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
compromise it will be necessary but i

752
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,720
think it's also about us delivering and

753
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
developing technology that will actually

754
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,679
give the kind of of certification or the

755
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
classification requirements

756
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,039
that will be stipulated by by

757
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
governments and i think we are seeing

758
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
that being developed on the european

759
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
union side as you know there are a lot

760
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
of of standard certification standards

761
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
now being developed that we will have to

762
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,480
comply with that we will comply with i

763
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,799
think the the compromise that you talk

764
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,559
about is actually also happening through

765
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,240
the dialogue and i think this is where

766
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
we can share expertise

767
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
from the inside you know what are we

768
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
seeing what is working with other

769
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
customers and then at the same time

770
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,679
listen very very carefully to the

771
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
concerns that that we're hearing and

772
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,760
adapting our technology to to that

773
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,559
situation and i think on on um

774
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,840
i think you're right in calling out that

775
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
there's a lot of focus on public private

776
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
partnerships and

777
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
you know all of us

778
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
are using those words quite a lot

779
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,000
i had the pleasure of serving on um a

780
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
globe's sake council on future and and

781
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
security

782
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
and defense issues chaired by by general

783
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,679
john allen and we came out with a report

784
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,799
a few weeks ago and one of the

785
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,320
recommendations in that report was

786
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,120
actually to create a high level um

787
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
dialogue between businesses and nato

788
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,159
around economic security and i think

789
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,919
what we are seeing now and

790
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
again it's not for me to to determine

791
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
that but at least for my chair what

792
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
we're seeing is an increased focus on a

793
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
slightly more formalized dialogue

794
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
between the industry and nato and

795
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
certainly also with the european union

796
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
and i think that's a welcoming step

797
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
forward i think it also holds the

798
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,600
private sector to account it's not only

799
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
about us sharing information with nato

800
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,919
with the european union it's also us

801
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,840
listening to the concerns or listening

802
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
to specific requirements of nato or the

803
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,760
european union so i hope that we will

804
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,600
see this and again a small hope that

805
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
we'll we'll have some sex coming out of

806
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,159
of the summit in madrid as well here

807
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,159
there was a question right in the sort

808
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,279
of middle back there somewhere

809
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
and and not to be funny but please make

810
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,039
sure that your question focuses on

811
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
having a question

812
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,799
was that a remark to me

813
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,840
he

814
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,679
decided not to ask questions all right

815
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
there was another one in this on the

816
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,320
side here and then

817
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
either

818
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,440
let's take two in one you and the net

819
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,799
curse

820
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,080
uh just wondering what do you think of

821
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
the concern of uh moving to cloud

822
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
infrastructure creating like a single

823
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,120
point of failure where one compromise

824
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,039
can impact a lot more because it's so

825
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,880
centralized thank you

826
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,799
and it goes let's take you as well just

827
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,760
to yeah

828
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
my question is a bit different uh uh you

829
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,039
talked about data sovereignty uh and and

830
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,919
uh one of the uh key issues

831
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
that that is one of the key issues many

832
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
of the governments don't adapt uh clouds

833
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,600
technologies quickly

834
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,039
uh as we know that uh applications have

835
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
moved from mainframes to microservices

836
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,799
from an architectural perspective

837
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,360
do you see that that could be also a

838
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,720
trend in the future for cloud

839
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,399
points or presences

840
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,799
for cloud dc's where

841
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,799
a cloud presence

842
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,880
of microsoft for instance could come to

843
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
smaller countries like estonia as well

844
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
so so two slightly uh different

845
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
questions i've understood the first one

846
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
was sort of a single point of failure i

847
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,760
mean are you more vulnerable if you go

848
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
to the cloud was that more or less you

849
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,360
it's difficult to hear up here

850
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,200
yeah okay

851
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
again again i i think that's that's a

852
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
concern that we hear uh every single day

853
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,799
with our customers and certainly

854
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,240
something i hear every single time i

855
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
meet with the european union decision

856
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,039
maker or nato decision maker um and uh

857
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,960
and and i think i understand where it's

858
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,039
coming from i understand also understand

859
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
that we have a particular responsibility

860
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
to put people in the comfort zone by

861
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
being super transparent by you know

862
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
developing technology that that

863
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,880
addresses those issues but i do think

864
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
that an important point here is just to

865
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
recognize that in in the world we're

866
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,360
living in now you know cloud solutions

867
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
will be a better way of protecting your

868
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
dates at the end of the day is it

869
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
without risk no it's not but is it

870
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,080
significantly more secure than having on

871
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,559
on-site the servers absolutely and i

872
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,840
think that's definitely where the

873
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,399
discussion is is going um but i do think

874
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,000
we have an obligation also to make sure

875
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,320
that we work in addressing the concerns

876
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,159
about the the single point of failure as

877
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,960
well

878
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,399
and i think your point about data

879
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,360
centers

880
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
and i'll be very transparent here and

881
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
probably uh step outside my my sort of

882
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
formal speaking notes and saying that i

883
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,799
think one of the problems with the

884
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,720
investments we've been making in europe

885
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,640
or around the world in data centers is

886
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,840
that it becomes

887
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,799
a commodity that everybody wants

888
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,320
and what i mean by that is that i don't

889
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,559
think we can find any country in europe

890
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,720
who wouldn't like an investment in a

891
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,000
data center

892
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
and and i think you know that's the

893
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
development that that is only natural

894
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
it's also about sort of investing in in

895
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
digital infrastructure i do think it's

896
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,480
also important to say that there will be

897
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
places where the volume the market

898
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,640
volume doesn't necessarily justify a

899
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
massive investment and data center and i

900
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
think that's where we are now developing

901
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,440
different models partnerships with local

902
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,000
companies to find a way of also making

903
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
sure that we invest in in the digital

904
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,080
transformation as well um so i think you

905
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,519
will see a

906
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,240
a

907
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,559
a a model moving forward where it's not

908
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,960
sort of a one-size-fits-all but rather

909
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,240
more diverse uh set of investments in in

910
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
europe around the world will we see more

911
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,840
investments in data centers absolutely

912
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
it's going to be critically important

913
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
for for everybody that we do

914
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,559
and and i know there's other questions

915
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,720
and i'll invite you to chase casper down

916
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,159
later in the day

917
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
since we also are the last thing between

918
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,880
you and your lunches

919
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,559
which is sacred

920
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,640
so to sum up

921
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,720
let's cycle back quickly to the

922
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
strategic outlook

923
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,919
what will you see keeping nato busy in

924
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,720
terms of both cyber security and

925
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,159
technology

926
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,799
in general and what's your expectation

927
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,039
for madrid

928
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,279
i think i've been alluding to what

929
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,320
i wouldn't say necessarily the

930
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,799
expectations are but but the hope is i

931
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,159
think we will see the word cyber

932
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,840
security feature quite heavily in the

933
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
new strategy concept although this is

934
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,440
just me guessing

935
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
and i do think and hope that the the

936
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
summit conclusions will also point to

937
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
the fact that

938
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,039
you know ukraine has demonstrated the

939
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,360
absolute necessity of nato to adapting

940
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,480
to a new world a new reality where what

941
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
began at the london summit with a focus

942
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
on emerging and disruptive technologies

943
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,559
that has sort of you know

944
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,240
created that's been momentum around it

945
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,399
and now we see a new situation where i

946
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,720
think madrid will

947
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
solidify the need for nato also to adapt

948
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
internally to respond to a new set of

949
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,240
threats and and challenges and i do

950
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,200
think that new world or that new reality

951
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
will require nato to work closer

952
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,799
together with the private sector there

953
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,320
are many interesting things happening i

954
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,840
just want to point out the work around

955
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,399
diana i think is enormously interesting

956
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,000
but also having a slightly more formal

957
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,519
formalized dialogue as i've said many

958
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,919
times before i think is going to be

959
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,240
important for nato but in fact also for

960
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
the private sector i think it is so

961
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,360
important that the private sector also

962
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,640
feels responsible for supporting nato at

963
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,399
a moment in time where we've seen the

964
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,120
geopolitical tectonic plates move at a

965
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
pace that none of us hoped but that's

966
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
where we are and i think we need to

967
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,559
respond to that

968
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,159
thank you and do you have any

969
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,080
housekeeping before you let us go

970
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,450
we do

971
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,840
[Laughter]

972
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,960
so um first of all thank you so much uh

973
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,200
casper klinger these are past for most

974
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,519
interesting discussion thank you all to

975
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
the audience for your uh questions

976
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,800
to you we have a small gift as an

977
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,119
appreciation of our well as a token of

978
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,879
