commitment of our world-class speakers

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
we do not have a budget to pay speaker

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
fees so all the outstanding experts that

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,840
you will see as our keynotes and

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
panelists

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
they do it for economy class tickets to

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,560
the audience don't

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
to prove that we're not completely

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,199
stingy

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
i would like to now reveal this year's

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,560
speaker gift

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,319
as a tradition it is an estonian

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
handcrafted item

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
and it this time it is a wooden case for

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,879
your

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,080
eyeglasses

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
most cyber people are equipped with them

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
and those that are not i'm sure you own

71

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
both of those sunny days that we have in

73

we will have a very special panel 11

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,080
o'clock main stage here

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
one year ago when we picked the theme

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
keep moving for this year's conference

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
we really could not have possibly known

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
how different the world would be

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
we first saw the world changing in the

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,238
post-pandemic world uh so we we thought

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
you know you better keep moving in a

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
changing world

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
but we did not foresee the cataclysmic

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,280
paradigm shift in the global security

125
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
environment brought by

126
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
russia acting on this 21st century

127
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,240
just like the soviet union did back in

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
1939 launching a brutal war of expansion

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
against the european neighbor

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
so when i visited kiev in january this

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
year i asked the military members who i

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,720
met there on their opinion of the

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
threat of war

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
and i was overwhelmed by the bravery in

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,720
their response they they said that

136
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
we the ukrainian soldiers we have been

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
fighting a war against russia for the

138
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
last eight years with one hand tied

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
behind our backs if you now get to have

140
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
a fair fight bring it on

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
if we

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
and and as we know

143
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
ukraine's heroic defense of their

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
country has been anything short of

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
amazing both in physical space and in

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
cyberspace

147
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,919

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,440
and we're proud to host a panel on the

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
cyber dimension of the war in ukraine

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
