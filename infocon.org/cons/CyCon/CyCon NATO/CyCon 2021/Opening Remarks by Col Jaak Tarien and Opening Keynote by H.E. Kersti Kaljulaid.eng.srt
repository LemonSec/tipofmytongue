growing both by size and importance

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
over years last year due to covert 19

cycan was replaced by a virtual book

dear faithful fans of cycon it is an

honor and privilege to welcome you to

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,399
the 13th annual

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
cycon conference and the first cycon

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
held in online format

49
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,280
we have a very nice studio set up here

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,799
in thailand and we are excited

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,758
and ready to go but i want to assure you

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,840
that we miss you

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,040
we want you to be here with us

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
online conferences are different and we

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
have adjusted to it

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
in the old days once we had you lured

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
here to the northern corner of europe we

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
had you boxed in

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
and we knew we could pump eight or more

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
hours

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
of latest type of research and high

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
policy trends into you

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
we know that today we are competing for

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
your attention

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
against lots of other content coming

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
from the parallel windows

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
of the same screen that we are on

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
i am painfully aware that the moment i

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
say a boring sentence

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
i have lost you to your fifth grader

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
math homework problem

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
thus our online cycles days are shorter

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
and more condensed

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
as always we do not feature cybertainers

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
on our virtual stage

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,319
people who present in the sitecom panels

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
have written scholarly research papers

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
that have been heavily scrutinized by

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
our selection board

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
the steamed keynote speakers have proven

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
their value with actions

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
and successes in their professional

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
careers

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
in various fields of government military

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,319
academia

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
and industry as always

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
it is nearly impossible for me to choose

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
some things from the agenda without

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,159
being completely

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
unfair to those that i failed to mention

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
but life is hardly ever fair and i'm

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,159
still going to make my subjective

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
highlights

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
we had a very busy workshop day

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
yesterday and i felt that the topics

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
were more practical and actionable

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
than ever before we were talking about

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
autonomy and automation in cyber defense

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,760
about building resilience

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
through the use of cyber ranges and

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
exercise about developing nato cyber

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
exercises to be

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
even more realistic and relevant

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,799
as for today's opening day the fireworks

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
of keynote speakers is a tradition and

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
shortly i will have the honor

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
to introduce them tomorrow after an

108
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
intense day of keynotes and exciting

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
panels stay tuned

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
and to the very end as keir giles will

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
interview with mithril perovich

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
in a fireside chat mithri is a member of

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
our center's advisory board

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,280
you might most likely know him as a

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
founder of crowdstrike currently dmitry

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
has devoted his efforts to advancing

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
american prosperity

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880

stage of our cycon conference

followers

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
welcome to cycon as already noted

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
the online cyclone is naturally

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
different in many aspects from this icon

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,039
that you and

139
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
us are used to there is noticeably one

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
item missing

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
from the agenda there is no women in

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
cyber breakfast this year

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
obviously there aren't any breakfast in

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
an online format

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,880
but there is more to it i felt at the

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
last icon in 2019 that the breakfast

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,240
format

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
is outdated that it is time to bring

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
this event to the prime light of the

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
main stage

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
and i intended to have a women in cyber

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
panel

153
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
and i failed miserably in air force

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,919
language

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,880
i crashed and burned but i learned a

156
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
very valuable lesson

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
that i would like to share in my best

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
intentions

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
i approached two very successful women

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
in a cyber business

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
one a startup entrepreneur often listed

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
in uh

163
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
top most influential women in tech list

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
by various publications

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
the other as a cyber security executive

166
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
and a large global bank and both

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
conversations while separate

168
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,160
went in a very similar pattern me

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
would you like to be would you be able

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,319
would you be available to participate

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
in the cycon conference them i would

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
love to

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
me great we're making a women-only panel

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,479
and talk about women in cyber them

175
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,318
no forget about it i'm not doing this

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
after the first conversation i was

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
confused when i noticed the pattern

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
after the second conversation i thought

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,400
i saw the light

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,080
i had been thinking that in order to

181
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
promote equality

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
we should promote women for being women

183
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
this kind of faulty thinking takes away

184
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
the most important

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,599
component of success the achievements

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
no one likes to be robbed from something

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
that they have worked so long and hard

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
for

189
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
only to be recognized for their gender

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
we do not practice gender quotas here at

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
cycon we never have we could not

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
our panelists are selected in a

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
double-blind review process

194
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,039
we invite our keynote speakers based on

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
merit and merit only

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
not based on gender race or any other

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
characteristic that a person

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
is born with and cannot affect

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
let me be clear the fact that women

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
represent only about 20 percent of

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
global

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
cybersecurity workforce is unacceptable

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
but the only viable long-term solution

204
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,280
is full

205
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,720
and transparent fairness not artificial

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
quotas

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
i'm calling for more women to submit

208
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
their papers to the next year's cycon

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
and i promise that you will have neither

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
an advantage

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,240
nor a disadvantage in our double-blind

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
selection process

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,758
as it has always been the case

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,599
i can assure you that those women on

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,199
site on stage this week

216
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
are here because of their achievements

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
and achievements only and there is no

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
better proof of this

219
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
than our first keynote speaker madam

220
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
president

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,620
saikon is yours

222
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,240
[Music]

223
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
thank you jack for the introduction and

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
thank you also for sharing your first

225
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
lesson in feminism indeed in 21st

226
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,800
century

227
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
women don't do any more things because

228
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
they are women

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
we work in a society equally

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,279
and i'm very grateful for people close

231
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,320
to

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
psychotropics who taught you this lesson

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
it's valuable

234
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
thank you all cyclone participants for

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
being virtually here

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,880
today with us let's be honest

237
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
i think that by now we're all

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
tired of all these virtual events and

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,399
video meetings

240
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,880
but the fact that there are more

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
registered participants in this year's

242
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
cycle

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
than ever before this also shows

244
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,360
just how important cyber conflict topics

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
still long

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,360
maybe more important than ever before

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
and it also shows

248
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
that you know where to come for

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
solutions and discussions

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
cycle of course looking back at the past

251
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,880
year

252
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
it's not surprising that cyclone's theme

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,240
is

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
going viral the global pandemic

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
changed a lot of things in our lives and

256
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
activities

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
hopefully most of these changes are

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
temporary

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
but when it comes to cyber i'd say

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
that the pandemic has really not changed

261
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
anything fundamentally

262
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
this statement may sound a bit

263
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
surprising to you

264
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
especially if we look back at some of

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
the gloomy warnings and predictions that

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
were made when the pandemic broke out in

267
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
early 2020

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
but in retrospect we can see

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
that both the pandemic and other

270
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,160
interesting incidents over the past year

271
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
only confirmed what we knew beforehand

272
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
about the trends threats and

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
vulnerabilities

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,959
a couple of examples the much talked

275
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
about cyber attacks against hospitals in

276
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
the czech republic

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,839
against vaccine laboratories in the uk

278
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
or against general practitioner centers

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
in finland

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
were not totally new in themselves

281
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
it was generally known beforehand that

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
healthcare organizations don't tend to

283
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,680
have that good cyber security practices

284
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
so it was logical that malicious actors

285
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
both state and non-state

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
tend to capitalize whatever walks of

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,839
life are currently on people's

288
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,079
minds or take the solarwinds attack

289
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
discovered last december that was

290
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
probably one of the biggest cyber

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
espionage cases so far

292
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
in us history we shouldn't

293
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
play of course the blame the victim game

294
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,480
but

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
i can't have been the only one who was

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,600
surprised

297
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
to find out that the company providing

298
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
network software to the us federal

299
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
government

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
didn't have a chief information security

301
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
officer

302
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
nor a director for cyber security on its

303
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
payroll

304
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
or that they were still using passwords

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
like solarwinds123

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
to access their service elementary

307
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,519
omissions

308
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
and the lack of basic cyber hygiene that

309
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
should have been long

310
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,160
dealt with what the pandemic did do

311
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
was that it widened the so-called

312
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
surface of attack

313
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
people moved large chunks of their

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
business government activities

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,639
learning and private life online

316
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,360
for cyber criminals and hackers this

317
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
just meant

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
the number of potential targets

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
increased immensely

320
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
and so over the past year we have

321
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,360
witnessed a general surge in the number

322
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
of attacks

323
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,360
and incidents the market for malicious

324
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
activities has opened up

325
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,920
and anybody with elementary programming

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
skills can do harm

327
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,079
and sell these skills to criminals

328
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
as we know the line between cyber crime

329
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
and spinach between state and non-state

330
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
actors

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
is thin but having said that

332
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
this trend of wider surfaces of attacks

333
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
was probably

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
anyway inevitable the pandemic

335
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,760
just accelerated this trend

336
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
the good news is that we know the core

337
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
and we have the vaccines for preemption

338
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
we've had them for a long time

339
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
and at least here in estonia and in the

340
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
nato cyber defense coe

341
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,800
we have been been talking about them for

342
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
years

343
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,079
we all still need very basic very

344
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,600
effective things

345
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,399
security by design synergy between state

346
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
and private actors

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
cyber hygiene for everybody

348
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,720
mainstreaming cyber defense

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,680
and the application of international law

350
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,079
on

351
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,279
cyber the pandemic didn't really change

352
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,000
anything here

353
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
it's understandable why politicians and

354
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
private citizens alike

355
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
are sometimes still slow to adhere to

356
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
these practices

357
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,760
often the news about cyber attacks don't

358
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
touch upon

359
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
a wide number of regular people however

360
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
the warning signs about large-scale

361
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
cyber disruptions

362
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
have been there all along

363
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,600
i believe that this is also starting to

364
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
change

365
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
as we are seeing more high-profile

366
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
events

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,079
just two weeks ago millions of americans

368
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,040
across the u.s east coast were standing

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
in queue

370
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,880
for hours for a tank of castle line

371
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
due to the very heavy ransomware attacks

372
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
against

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
the fuel supplier colonial pipeline

374
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,320
the risks and consequences of cyber

375
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
attacks

376
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,079
probably do not get any clearer than

377
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,639
that

378
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,800
for any man on the bus or in the car

379
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
ladies and gentlemen i would now like to

380
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,079
put

381
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,560
some things into a bit wider perspective

382
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
to talk about not only the risks and

383
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
threats that come with cyber and digital

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
but also about some of the possibilities

385
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,959
that the past year has highlighted for

386
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,079
me

387
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
and where trust and security plays a

388
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
vital part

389
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,920
last year we saw how interdependent

390
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
we actually are from each other how

391
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,399
intertwined

392
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,480
and fragile global supply chains are

393
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
we're also witnessing a resurgence of a

394
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,399
global competition

395
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
between democratic and authoritarian

396
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,040
powers

397
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,120
that will probably become one of the key

398
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,399
words of the 21st century

399
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,360
the outcome of this competition depends

400
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
on who controls the infrastructure

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,680
that the economies rely on

402
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,560
this includes the ways we move goods and

403
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,839
people

404
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
how we produce and transport energy

405
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
how we create transfer and store digital

406
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
data

407
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,480
by infrastructure we don't mean merely

408
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
roads or power lines

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
but also the information technology

410
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,240
capabilities of regions

411
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
and organizations like data management

412
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,120
mobile telecommunications and network

413
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
infrastructure

414
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
this is something where like-minded

415
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
democratic countries

416
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,920
with market economies could really take

417
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
the next step forward

418
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,199
in using the possibilities that their

419
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
economies and close

420
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
ties offer so what we would need

421
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,079
is a way or a model if you like

422
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
to promote quality investments

423
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
investments that are inclusive

424
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
transparent

425
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
economically viable financially

426
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,440
environmentally and socially sustainable

427
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
and compliant with international

428
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,720
standards and regulation

429
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,959
by agreeing on common standards and

430
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,000
guaranteeing the free flow of data

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
we could create the necessary

432
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,119
transparency most of all

433
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,559
we need a stamp of trust to make these

434
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,280
projects

435
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
and investments trustworthy

436
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,480
that would make large-scale cross-border

437
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
infrastructure investments

438
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,240
attractive for the private sector

439
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,799
i would call this initiative trust-based

440
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
connectivity

441
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
it's strongly related to smart

442
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
connectivity as it was titled that the

443
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
three seas virtual summit held in

444
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
estonia last october

445
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
but trust based really coins the essence

446
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
much better and as you of all people

447
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
know very well

448
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,240
trust is very much about security we are

449
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
currently discussing and brainstorming

450
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,039
on how to implement this initiative

451
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,200
for all of you who are interested in

452
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
this topic

453
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,799
i recommend you sign up for the telling

454
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,919
digital summit

455
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,880
in september dear listeners

456
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
last but not least i would like to touch

457
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
upon the developments

458
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,000
on how international law applies in

459
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,559
cyberspace

460
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
this is the focal point of estonian

461
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
cyber diplomacy

462
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,240
and also the nato coe italian

463
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,880
two years ago when we last met in person

464
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
at cycon

465
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,799
i officially introduced the estonian

466
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,320
official position

467
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,520
on this topic we compiled

468
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,120
and we openly declared our position

469
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
not only to give our cyber specialists

470
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
diplomats and law experts further

471
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,919
guidance for their everyday activities

472
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,480
but also statements like these

473
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,360
are the things that actually create

474
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,080
define

475
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
develop international law which by

476
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,280
definition

477
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,880
is a case law we did it

478
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
and we encouraged other countries to

479
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
follow suit

480
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
some had also gone before us

481
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,640
two years ago only a couple of states

482
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
had done something similar

483
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,840
uk and france but the number of official

484
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,720
statements

485
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
is increasing constantly for example

486
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
germany

487
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
netherlands finland all have joined this

488
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
club

489
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
in the meantime furthermore there are

490
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
now enough official statements on the

491
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
application of international law in

492
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,039
cyberspace

493
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,160
that the nato cyber defense coe is

494
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
compiling a new

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,799
third version of the italian manual to

496
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,080
start codifying these positions

497
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
we ourselves have been elaborating our

498
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,840
five

499
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,919
basic positions our supplemented

500
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
official position has now increased from

501
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
a couple of pages to nine i hope no more

502
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,000
added bureaucracy

503
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
is necessary and it will be introduced

504
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,320
in a couple of weeks

505
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,480
at the un group of governmental experts

506
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
also as i promised when running for the

507
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
non-permanent seat of the un security

508
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
council

509
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
we have started to mainstream this topic

510
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
in the u.n

511
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
last spring estonia together with us and

512
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,919
uk

513
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,840
condemned the 2019 cyber attacks against

514
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,320
georgia

515
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
thus discussing the issue for the first

516
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,840
time

517
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
ever in the security council

518
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
unconceivable but indeed this was true

519
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
it had never been discussed in

520
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,919
sc this june during our second

521
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,400
presidency of the security council

522
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
will hold a high level open debate on

523
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
cyber security

524
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
which will be the first time that the

525
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,960
u.n security council members officially

526
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,840
discuss

527
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
this among themselves

528
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
yes we all know that consensus for

529
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,240
change

530
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
takes a lot on the a lot of time on the

531
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
international sea

532
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,080
especially in the u.n but even these

533
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
relatively small steps are still steps

534
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
forward

535
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
the other option would be to do nothing

536
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
and watch as a bystander as malicious

537
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
activities go viral

538
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,320
because some still doubt that

539
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
international law

540
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,039
should also apply in cyberspace

541
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
but we do not accept it we continue to

542
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,039
work

543
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
for the everybody to understand

544
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
thank you for listening and i wish you

545
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,080
all

546
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
a really interesting conference see you

547
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,919
hopefully

548
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
next year maybe more in person but i

549
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,400
also welcome that the highest ever

550
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
number of participants

551
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,640
has been achieved via this hybrid method

552
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
it is also something to celebrate

553
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,399
not only to come commiserate thank you
