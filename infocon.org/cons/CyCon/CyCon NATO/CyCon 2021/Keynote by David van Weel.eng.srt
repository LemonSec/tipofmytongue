your thoughts and ideas

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
also on social media by using the

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
hashtag psychon2021

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
i hardly think that nato assistant

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
secretary general for emerging security

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,199
challenges

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
mr davenport real needs much

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
introduction so without further ado

[Music]

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
thank you hendrik and ladies and

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
gentlemen good afternoon it's a pleasure

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,799
joining you today

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,159
and i'm very happy to be able to

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,720
continue the legacy of representing nato

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
cyber at this prestigious event

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
my thanks go to the center of excellence

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
as ever for organizing this event and

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
for the diligence in keeping this

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
important platform going

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
over all these years 2021 is a watershed

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
year for cyber and in more ways than one

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
first we witness a growing diversity of

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
risks and incidents

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,759
second we can observe a growing

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
diversity in the strategic context of

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,280
cyber

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
and third as a consequence we are seeing

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,119
a growing diversity

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
of nato's responses to cyber challenges

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
let me address each of these

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
developments in turn

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,080
first the risks and incidents here we

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
can observe that threat actors are

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
consistently broadening the range of

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,080
tools

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
for challenging the alliance in

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
cyberspace i offer three examples

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
one example is ransomware ransomware

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,760
used to be

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
associated with seeking economic

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
benefits and it was never seen as a

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
major political factor

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
however ransomware attacks have now

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
become so severe

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
that the uk and csc and others have

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
started to issue regular warnings

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
about this formal threat the attack by

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
the dark side group against colonial

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
pipeline in the u.s

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
was a very recent reminder of the

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
growing significance

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
of ransomware attacks and since colonial

78
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
pipelines supplied almost half

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
of the fuel for the us east coast the

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
attacks disrupted that supply and led to

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
considerable increase

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
in gas prices as a result airlines had

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,080
to reschedule their flights to bunker

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
and the biden administration relax some

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
regulatory conditions

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
regarding the quality of patrol to

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
ensure

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
continuity of supply to the pumps

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
what is interesting from our perspective

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
is a statement put out by dark side

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
ransomware

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
group the group that was designated by

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
the us as being responsible

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
perhaps feeling some kind of retaliation

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,000
or consequences

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
they issued a statement saying that they

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
were not they were only in it for the

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,319
money

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
and not politically motivated whether

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
this is any consolation i leave for you

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
to judge

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
another example of the broadening of the

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
toolbox of hybrid aggressors

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,440
is influence operations these two are on

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,159
the rise

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,080
and we witness more and more cases of

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
information being corrupted

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
or modified in order to influence

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
populations or decision makers

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
often with the helpful social media

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
one recent example was the targeting of

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
polish government websites

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
and official social media accounts the

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
aim of attackers was to spread false

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
information

116
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
most likely in order to stir up unrest

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,080
about plans

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
for poland's nuclear power program

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
finally we see an uptick in

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,519
cyber-enabled espionage

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,000
as exemplified by the solarwinds case at

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
the turn of the year

123
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,519
that case was interesting because it

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
compromised a company which represented

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
a highly lucrative target

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
as a jumping-off point for the

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,280
perpetrators to then access a wealth of

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
downstream users

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,199
some liken this attack to a kind of

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
cyber intelligence preparation of the

131
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
battlefield

132
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
there's a saying that one should never

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
let a good crisis go to waste

134
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
and that's why we need to ask ourselves

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
the question but that these incidents

136
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
are leading us to adapt our defenses

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
accordingly

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
in fact we are seeing this play out in

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
real time as the bind administration and

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
u.s congress

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
are determined to rapidly review the

142
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
lessons of solar winds

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
and colonial pipeline clearly the us is

144
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
regarding these attacks as a wake-up

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
call

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
it should be for all of us we need to be

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,639
even more vigilant than before

148
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
the second major change is the growing

149
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
dynamism of the strategic context in

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
which these threats occur

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
many nations are becoming more muscular

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
and overt about their approaches and

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
tolerance to cyber risks

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
there's also a growing perception that

155
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
cyber deterrence may not be the best way

156
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
to look at the issue

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
for example the 2018 u.s cyber defense

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,199
strategy

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
tones down the deterrence notion and

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
instead uses terminology like

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
persistent engagement for a long time

162
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
the dominant narrative was that

163
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
cyberspace should be treated

164
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
just like any other domains like air

165
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
land and sea

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
not anymore the pendulum is beginning to

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
swing

168
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,039
cyberspace is unique and hence we need

169
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,680
to find

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
a better conceptualization using

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
insufficient analogies from nuclear

172
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
deterrence theory or special operations

173
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
will not help decision makers rather it

174
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
will mislead them

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
the notion of cyber deterrence may sound

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
reassuring yet the more we learn about

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,039
cyberspace

178
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
the less compelling it appears to draw

179
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
parallels between the cyber and nuclear

180
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,880
domains

181
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
and in a similar vein we need to revisit

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,280
the notion of thresholds

183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
a good example of cyber attribution

184
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
for quite some time we have put our

185
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
hopes in the belief that aggressors

186
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
don't want to be called out

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,560
hence the mere risk of being named and

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
shamed would deter them

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
from committing certain malign actions

190
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
it doesn't appear

191
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,080
so we see an increasing number of

192
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
statements which call out unacceptable

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
behavior in cyberspace

194
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
yet this drawing of new red lines

195
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,919
doesn't seem to have much of a deterrent

196
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,960
effect

197
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
on the contrary we see old thresholds

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
being crossed

199
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,199
now the good news is that many stricken

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,880
nations seem increasingly willing to

201
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,759
strike back

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
with a set of tools that's broader than

203
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
merely attribution

204
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
but the fact of the matter is that the

205
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
goal posts are moving

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,280
the rubicon that you just wouldn't cross

207
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
is no more

208
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
clearly the role of cyber on the

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
geopolitical stage

210
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
continues to grow one indication is the

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
discussion on supply chain risk

212
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
be it through solar winds late last year

213
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,759
or the ongoing discussion about trust

214
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,280
and third party vendors

215
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
that surfaced during the debate over the

216
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
transition to 5g

217
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
we also see the private sector flexing

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,360
its muscles acting in some respects with

219
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,599
quasi-state-like power

220
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
is social media companies silencing

221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
elected officials a good thing

222
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
is it ethical is it even a role of the

223
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,080
private company to de-platform somebody

224
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
finally there's also an increasing

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
recognition of the nature of the

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,199
persistent struggle

227
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
between offense and defense simply put

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
the assumption that in cyberspace the

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
defense is always one step behind

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,840
might not hold forever shifting to a

231
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,879
proactive approach

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
as some allies have done may be

233
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
indication of this change

234
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
in any case there is no law of nature

235
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
that would condemn the defensive

236
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,840
to always lose out my third and final

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,400
point

238
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
is the need to have a broad range of

239
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,919
responses

240
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
just as the threat landscape is

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
diversifying

242
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
so must our cyber toolbox as many of you

243
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,599
will be aware

244
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,759
allies are presently in the midst of

245
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,799
negotiating

246
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
a new nato cyber defense policy due to

247
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
be agreed later this summer

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
it represents a major update of our

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
previous policy which was agreed in 2014

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
at the will summit

251
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
the 2014 policy was in itself quite

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,959
significant

253
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
it brought cyber defense under the

254
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
umbrella of collective defense

255
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
the famous article 5 and has affirmed

256
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,839
the applicability of

257
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
international humanitarian law to

258
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
cyberspace

259
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
since then we've consistently broadened

260
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
our cyber toolbox

261
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,600
in 2016 at the warsaw summit allies

262
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,000
committed

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
to the cyber defense pledge to

264
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
strengthen the cyber defenses

265
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
of national infrastructures and networks

266
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,440
and to do so as a matter of priority

267
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
allies also agreed to recognize

268
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,519
cyberspace as a domain of operations

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
just as air land and sea associated with

270
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,519
this

271
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,120
we also adopted the nato command

272
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
structure to bring online

273
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,120
a new cyberspace operations center the

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
syog and we created a unique platform

275
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
the so-called kapha the mouthful of

276
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
sovereign cyber effects provided

277
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,959
voluntarily by allies which allows

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
allies to volunteer their national

279
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
offensive cyber capabilities

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
into alliance operations and missions

281
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
looking at the question of critical

282
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
infrastructure so-called nato's baseline

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
requirements for national resilience

284
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
were updated in 2019 and 2020

285
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,839
to take into account the challenge from

286
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
5g foreign direct investments

287
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
and the implications of the covert

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
pandemic

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,079
these non-binding guidelines represent

290
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,519
the canon

291
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
of good practice for allies to help them

292
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,600
build national resilience

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
because we understand that nato's

294
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
collective performance as a defence

295
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
alliance

296
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
ultimately depends upon the national

297
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,880
resilience of each

298
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,959
ally a similar logic applies to nato's

299
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
dependence on national supply chains

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
nato's own infrastructure is relatively

301
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,839
small which makes it crucially important

302
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,480
for us

303
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
to review our own measures for

304
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
addressing supply chain risks

305
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,279
this particularly true for those

306
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,160
technologies

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,360
that underpin nato's own ict footprint

308
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
and our operations and missions

309
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
finally let me return to the bigger

310
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
pitch

311
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
in 2019 allies agreed a nato guide for

312
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,959
strategic response options

313
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
to malicious cyber activities this guide

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
or toolbox

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
sets out a range of measures that allies

316
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
and nato can take to respond to cyber

317
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,560
threats

318
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
below the threshold of an armed attack

319
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
amongst the elements it lists diplomatic

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
or political statements

321
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
economic sanctions that allies may wish

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
to agree and implement

323
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
within the sovereign right the explosion

324
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
of officials

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
the sharing of information and of course

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
attribution

327
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
the guide reinforces the importance of

328
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,399
nato as an important venue for exchange

329
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,600
of information

330
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
and as a means to signal unity and

331
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
solidarity for example in the case of

332
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,320
collective

333
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
attribution in sum our cyber toolbox is

334
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
broadening

335
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
in line with the diversifying threat

336
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
landscape and we must do everything to

337
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
maintain the momentum

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,240
in our cyber agenda so what's next

339
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
a few pointers first the upcoming summit

340
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,839
will place an understandable emphasis

341
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,120
upon resilience

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
as part of the nato 2030 agenda

343
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
as has become obvious during the

344
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
pandemic there is something of a perfect

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
storm

346
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
approaching with regards to cyber supply

347
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,639
chain issues

348
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
our societies are more and more reliant

349
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
upon resilient infrastructures

350
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,480
frequently underpinned by cyber

351
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
technologies

352
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
but these infrastructures are subject to

353
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
risk stemming from a complex economic

354
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
and industrial landscape

355
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
these risks force us to adopt and to

356
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,959
implement

357
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,040
more sophisticated approaches to

358
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
resilience

359
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,519
in keeping our society safe and secure

360
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
there are no easy fixes

361
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,959
second we need to better align strategy

362
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
with the strategic environment

363
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
given the diversifying threat landscape

364
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,880
i described earlier

365
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
this should be a no-brainer yet all too

366
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
often i find that there's too little

367
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
thought given to this

368
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
in particular we will need to fully

369
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,880
acknowledge

370
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
that the real security implications of

371
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,200
the expectation of cyberspace

372
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
do not come from a single big bang but

373
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
for the accumulating effect

374
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
of risk salami slicing away at our

375
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,680
defense

376
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,000
in other words those who want to harm us

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
can achieve the same strategic gains

378
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
below the threshold of our response

379
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
and this means that allies will need to

380
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,360
be ready and comfortable with using all

381
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
the all the tools in the toolbox

382
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
to manage escalation risk

383
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
clearly rolling with the punches seems

384
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
to no longer be an effective way of

385
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,320
dealing with aggression in cyberspace

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
third we must make an even greater

387
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
effort to use nato as a unifying

388
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
platform

389
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
this pertains in particular to the

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
discussion on tech standards

391
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
where innovation has implications for

392
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
cyber

393
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
the current debate on artificial

394
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
intelligence is such a case

395
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
but nato's unifying role can also be

396
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
extended to the ongoing debate

397
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,279
on cyber norms and the application of

398
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,920
international humanitarian law

399
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
in all of these areas we should use nato

400
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,079
to help us devise

401
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
a collective response to our challenges

402
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
in the international system

403
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,639
we must not allow those revisionist

404
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
powers to destroy this system

405
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,920
then finally in responding to new

406
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,279
security challenges

407
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,680
we are also rapidly progressing on our

408
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
work on emerging and disruptive

409
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
technologies

410
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
our artificial intelligence strategy

411
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
will be published shortly

412
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
and we are also working on a policy to

413
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
help nato make the most of the vast

414
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
volumes of data

415
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
while data and ai are inextricably

416
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,519
linked

417
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,360
cyber defense is no doubt going to be

418
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,880
one of the key areas

419
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,160
in which they will apply ladies and

420
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,720
gentlemen

421
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,279
let me close by noting that cyberspace

422
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,560
doesn't stand still

423
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
and similarly if we are to keep our

424
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
promise of protecting our populations

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
neither can nato we have to be able to

426
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,320
adapt

427
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
to the changing trends of disruption and

428
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
expectation of cyberspace

429
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
to the changing thinking and

430
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
conceptualization of responses

431
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,040
and to our evolved understanding of the

432
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
tasks and priorities for nato

433
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
in defending cyberspace looking at the

434
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
evolution of nato cyber defence policy

435
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,720
and toolbox

436
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
i can confidently say that this

437
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
adaptation will succeed

438
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
thank you for attention and i wish you a

439
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
great conference
