5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,400
fortnet

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,799
before joining fortnite mr quaid has

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,400
amongst other things served as

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
the nsa director's special assistant for

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,439
cyber

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,400
and as chief of the nsa cyber task force

[Music]

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,140
so

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:01:10,840
[Music]

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
so

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:55,120
[Music]

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
hi everybody uh my name is phil quade

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
and i appreciate the opportunity to have

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,000
some time to spend with you today talk

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,880
about uh

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
to talk about nato uh the world's

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
changed quite a bit

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
in the 70 plus years since nato has been

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
established and one thing is

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
we can be certain of is that 20 the

27
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
decade of 2020 will be no exception

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
uh in the in the 30 plus years or so i

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,879
worked at the national security agency

30
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,160
the white house and

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
uh with nato and many other uh important

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
allies

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
and now as five years as c cells one of

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
the largest and most integrated cyber

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
security companies

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
one of the things i've learned is that

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
some things haven't changed

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
and that's the importance of strategy

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,959
planning

40
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
capabilities and people so what i'd like

41
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,120
to do

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
is share some of the challenges and

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
opportunities ahead of us

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
as nato plans cyber policy for the

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
decade ahead

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
and importantly as nato plans itm i.t

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
modernization for the decade ahead

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,959
because policy that's disconnected from

49
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
strategy and capabilities in people

50
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
uh just won't be realized so uh if i

51
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
could i'd like to share some

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
visuals to complement some of the words

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
that i plan to use

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
and let's go ahead and start stepping

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
through some of those things

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
so i start with a lofty title of the

57
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,200
capitalism

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,959
of cyber security and the message behind

59
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
these words on the chart is that the

60
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,480
private sector has come a

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
long way towards um providing some of

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
the high-end capabilities

63
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
that our countries need to do collect to

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,560
defend

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,040
support collective offense in in support

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,000
of our our

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
our democratic mission and um we're

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
going to jump to that

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
a little bit later on specifically what

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,200
i mean about the

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
the capitalism aspect but what i'd first

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,480
like to do is uh

73
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
take a look at some of the technology

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
aspect of things and look at

75
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
future architectures

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
so today or historically

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
we had cyber security architectures of

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
consists of

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,519
computers and servers and things like

80
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
that and i call that the core

81
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
and we quickly realized that we could

82
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,760
become more efficient in how we use

83
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
those computers

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
if we virtualize some of those

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
capabilities so they could be used by

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,040
many people

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,640
and the the the percentage use would be

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
greatly increased a much more efficient

89
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
process but throughout we always had

90
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
the uh um the issue of well how do you

91
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
get people to be able to connect to

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,519
those

93
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
uh assets whether they are in your core

94
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
or in your cloud and we call that

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,479
endpoint

96
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,240
now the end point has changed quite a

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
bit over the years right it was

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,560
uh first the end point was uh

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
uh desktops and and it evolved later on

100
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,919
we're going to talk a little bit more

101
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
about the importance of that

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,560
but the uh the important thing from a

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
strategy perspective is not whether you

104
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,720
had good endpoint security or good cloud

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,759
security or good

106
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
uh core security it's the best strategy

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
and the best capabilities are the ones

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
that integrated your defense across all

109
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
three of those aspects of your

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
architecture because

111
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
you don't want your adversary to pick

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
the time and place of their choosing

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
to exploit your network by having an

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
integrated defense across the endpoint

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
the core in the cloud

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
you could defend at the time and place

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
of your strength and weakness and of

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
your choosing

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
ideally so the best architectures

120
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
had integrated defense across all

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
aspects of the architecture

122
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,120
and it had threat intelligence right uh

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
substantial research informing each of

124
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
those capabilities no matter where they

125
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,440
exist on what the threat is at any given

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,160
moment

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
in sending out proposed mitigations to

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
those threats so this is pretty good

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
stuff this type of architecture

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,479
integrated defense

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,680
informed by uh informed by threat

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
intelligence

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
now what's changed though is uh the end

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,880
point

135
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
the the endpoint used to be

136
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
characterized solely as desktop

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
computers

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
and laptop computers maybe tablets and

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,160
of course uh

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
smartphones but what's about to change

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
drastically is

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
as uh the endpoint's going to explode

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
now i call this

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
um this phenomenon sci-fi it's the

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
the integration of the cyber environment

146
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
what you traditionally see on the

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,400
right-hand side of these charts

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
with the physical environment and so

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
let's take a little bit closer look what

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,360
that physical environment is going to

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
look like

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
so historically the the instrumentation

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
of the physical domain

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
is mostly characterized by something we

155
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
all call operational technology right

156
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
our critical infrastructures

157
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
for many many decades have used sensors

158
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
and actuators and other in

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
other analytic tools to ensure that

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,400
these physical oriented devices whether

161
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
they be in our

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,840
uh moving electricity or in our smart

163
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
factories

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
are doing the right thing for the

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
purposes of safety and reliability

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,960
but i think as we all know the the

167
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
physical domain is going to get a whole

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
lot more interesting

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
primarily with the explosion of the use

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,600
of the internet of things devices right

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
iot devices are going to rapidly

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
instrument our

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
physical domain and that could be our

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
offices our cars

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
our cities and even our bodies

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,319
there'll be sensors everywhere and as

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,599
we'll talk about later on

178
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
they'll be both great opportunities and

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
great challenges as we instrument that

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,319
physical domain

181
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
and lastly as i've alluded to it all our

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,160
buildings whether they're

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
our simple old office buildings or our

184
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,599
highest tech

185
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,400
um smart factories are are going to be

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
heavily instrumented

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
so i call that the uh the

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
instrumentation of the physical domain

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,319
and a lot of data is going to be

190
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
generated in that domain

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,199
and that's going to be greatly enabled

192
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
by fast ubiquitous communications out

193
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
there in that physical domain

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
so you can move information back and

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
forth in that physical domain and

196
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
that information might not ever traverse

197
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
the traditional cyber domain that we

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
have illustrated on the right

199
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,919
the story doesn't quite end there

200
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
because here's the real opportunity

201
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
um why don't we take data that's

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,319
generated in that physical domain

203
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
and richly intermingle it responsibly

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
with data and insights we generate in

205
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
the cyber domain so that's the true

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
sci-fi vision taking advantage of the

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
insights we can get from the the uh

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
i'll call the tactical insights we could

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,759
get from the physical domain

210
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
and combine it with the more contextual

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
or maybe strategic insights we can

212
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,919
generate

213
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,160
in the cyber domain where we have high

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
performance computing in the cloud

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
big data analytics the cloud it's a

216
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,919
great opportunity

217
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,039
to take advantage of the sci-fi

218
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
sci-fi um convergence

219
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
um now of course with great opportunity

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
comes great responsibility we need to

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
make sure that we collectively do this

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,479
uh with the right privacy involved so

223
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,200
after all

224
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,919
we humans are elements of the physical

225
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,958
domain so

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,839
information about uh where we're driving

227
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
what we're doing inside or even how fast

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,680
our heart might be beating

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
is you know absolutely deserves the

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
highest privacy protections

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
similarly a data integrity becomes very

232
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
important some of our previous speakers

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
correctly talked about information

234
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
poisoning and information in

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
integrity attacks so data coming from

236
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
the physical domain

237
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
has to have the right type of data

238
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
integrity now

239
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
what i've tried to do is just give a

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
quick glimpse of what i think the future

241
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,800
uh

242
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
domain's going to look like in the

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
future architectures look like

244
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
but the the heart of my time with you

245
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,279
today um

246
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
is not so much on those hard high-tech

247
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
things don't get me wrong i'd love to

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
talk more about architecture

249
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
and technology capabilities and i'm

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
passionate about that

251
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,880
strategy i talked about earlier of

252
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
linking your endpoint

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
your core and your cloud with integrated

254
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
fast cyber defenses

255
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
but there's one part of the equation in

256
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
addition to that that's uh

257
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
too often is overlooked and that's the

258
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
people side of the problem

259
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
and uh as you might know

260
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,600
uh in our field the cyber security field

261
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
there's a huge skills gap right you can

262
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
see some of the numbers up on your

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
screen

264
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
basically the the demand is

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
far far outstripping the supply and

266
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
that's affecting all this whether it's

267
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
small organizations big organizations

268
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
government private sector and it's

269
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
resulting in

270
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,360
uh unfo un unfilled positions it's

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
making us spend a lot of money searching

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
for people

273
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,079
and ultimately it's not an aimless to

274
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,279
accomplish the mission

275
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
or business objectives at the pace that

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,560
we'd like to do

277
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,320
now we my my view on this is that

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
we can't just imagine we're going to

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,920
suddenly churn out

280
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
four million new computer science degree

281
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
people to cover this gap

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,440
we need to do indeed uh

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
invest more in stem education but it's

284
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
not practical think we're going to

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
uh churn out that many more computer

286
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
science computer scientists to fill this

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,959
gap

288
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
so what we need to do i think is come up

289
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
with a

290
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,040
strategy that a little bit more aligned

291
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
with what i would call capitalism so

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
um you know quick reminder

293
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
how we all got here sorry nato of course

294
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
is fundamentally a

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
a collect a collection of like-minded

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
nations that um believe in some core

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,800
things

298
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,279
like democracy right um like capitalism

299
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
and that's what that's what make our

300
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
economic and our government our social

301
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
engines roar

302
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
for many decades behind us and many

303
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
decades ahead

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
but there's also a third part of this

305
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
which i'd call social responsibility

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
it's not quite written in our

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
constitutions and other

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
other official documentation but i think

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
we all recognize that it's there that

310
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
um unfettered uh capitalism without some

311
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
type of social responsibility

312
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
um has a lot of speed bumps that we need

313
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,680
to address so what i'd like to do is

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
talk today a little bit about

315
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,560
some strategies that that that

316
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
you know stay well in tune with our um

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
our core beliefs of democracy and

318
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
capitalism while we go about

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
solving the cyber security problem and

320
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
more specifically

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
i think we can come up with some idea we

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
can come up with some strategies and

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,079
approaches

324
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,839
to not only solve the cyber security

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
problem but create opportunities for

326
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
people

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
that they just don't that too many young

328
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,079
people and others don't see that they

329
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,200
have today

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
so let's talk about some more specifics

331
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,639
so fundamentally what i'm talking about

332
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,600
is applying

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
the tentative capitalism of balancing

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,959
supply and demand

335
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,519
and i have about uh four or five uh

336
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
specific ideas i want to talk about

337
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,800
uh the first one is going to be no

338
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,519
surprise right from a again i'm from a

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,000
um

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
a very high well-integrated cyber

341
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,839
security company

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
and one of the things that we focus on

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
quite a bit at fortinet

344
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
is the integration of our capabilities

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,959
and the automation of our capabilities

346
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
right if you have capabilities at the

347
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,320
end point up in the cloud

348
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
in your core you can't afford to have um

349
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
the complexity you can't afford for the

350
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
complexity burden of operating

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
those capabilities to be so high that

352
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,839
ultimately start making mistakes

353
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,800
so you really need to rely on the uh

354
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,839
techniques of

355
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
automation to decrease the volume that

356
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,279
people have to

357
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
that have to personally process and of

358
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,399
course

359
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,800
integration to reduce that complexity so

360
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,079
there's lots of different ways to do

361
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,040
that

362
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
you know you see some of the techniques

363
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
you have in my on my screen here

364
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,519
xero trust is indeed it's not just a

365
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,160
buzzword

366
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
it is indeed a strategy with

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
capabilities behind it i highly

368
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
encourage you to pursue

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
zero trust strategies you see the other

370
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,560
very

371
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
valuable viable things on the screen as

372
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,600
well

373
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
but again i'm not here today to give you

374
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
a fortinet capabilities brief hopefully

375
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
you'll you know spend some more time on

376
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
this in another time

377
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
but my point here is saying that one of

378
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
the five core things we need to do

379
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
is decrease the demand on our people by

380
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,920
better leveraging

381
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,839
and automation integration in our cyber

382
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
security strategies

383
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,360
um the next point i have i'd like to

384
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
spend a little bit more time on

385
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
which is uh diversity of perspective now

386
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,040
some of the when you're trying to create

387
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
a a

388
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,399
a good team of people you you

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
you assemble people with some core

390
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
competencies right you want to have some

391
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
hardcore technologists you want to have

392
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,920
some

393
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
soft skilled people who are really good

394
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
at getting others to work together

395
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,160
you want to have people who are

396
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,000
experienced and of course she needs this

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,560
all

398
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
i believe informed by strategy driven by

399
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,600
strategy

400
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
but along the way you know as you as you

401
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,519
manage larger and larger organizations

402
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
and more and more complex operations as

403
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,920
you go

404
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
over the years what you learn though is

405
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
that um

406
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
diversity is really really important um

407
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
i throw a couple examples up here

408
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
um in my my days in the national

409
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,360
security community

410
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
probably one of the best cyber threat

411
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
analysts i ever met wasn't a computer

412
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,079
science degree people

413
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,040
he was an anthropologist and he might

414
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
look at me funny for saying that but

415
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
but he brought in perspectives that the

416
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,160
rest of us just couldn't imagine he

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,040
understood

418
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,519
human evolution he he understood our

419
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,160
instincts

420
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,959
and it helped help he helped us

421
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,160
understand

422
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
why certain foreign adversaries or bad

423
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
actors might be acting the way they did

424
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,279
another person who absolutely drove me

425
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
crazy at the time

426
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
at the beginning until i learned i got

427
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
wiser he was from the cia so

428
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,199
um i was in charge of

429
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,519
some computer network attack operations

430
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
and my approach was always

431
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
if you want to go from a to b you draw a

432
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
state line and go from a to b

433
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
well he had different training he was a

434
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
history major and he was trained by the

435
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,720
cia when before he came to work for me

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
instead of going from a to b he would go

437
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
from a to c to d to f

438
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
to z and x he'd finally get to b he'd

439
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,680
always get to b

440
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
and quite honestly the solution he had

441
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
uh was much better than

442
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,720
the one i would have come up with from

443
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
with my straight line approach

444
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,440
my point being is that um it's not about

445
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,079
having

446
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,959
a bunch of uh computer scientists or

447
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
electrical engineers all trained in the

448
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,120
same way

449
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
the right background we really need to

450
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
have education diversity

451
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,600
and to be clear i'm not a computer

452
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,199
science hater i'm a computer scientist

453
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,519
myself by education and training

454
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,720
but i've learned that diversity is

455
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
really really important and the highest

456
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,160
performing teams

457
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
i ever worked on had all three of these

458
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
attributes

459
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
we had some core competencies we had

460
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
some education diversity

461
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
but importantly we had a diversity of

462
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,279
background

463
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
and um it included uh

464
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,440
both minorities and non-minorities and

465
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,399
my point being

466
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,920
is that when you have different

467
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,759
perspectives it makes your your team

468
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,320
stronger i even threw a couple cartoons

469
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,079
in here just to drive the point home

470
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,600
you know if you quickly look at this

471
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
diagram you know which person is correct

472
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,079
are there

473
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,800
four or the three items on on on the on

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
the right hand side

475
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,759
and similarly with diversity of

476
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
perspective you know it gives you

477
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
better feel for what you're looking at

478
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,639
are you looking at the broadest most

479
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
distance and biggest things you can

480
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,720
imagine

481
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
or are you looking about the most

482
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
smallest and important things you can

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,720
imagine

484
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
diversity of perspective will help you

485
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,079
get to the truth

486
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,199
and so that's why i believe that

487
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
diversity is a really really important

488
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,519
part

489
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
of solving our cybersecurity skills gap

490
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,279
problem

491
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
it'll make us better better operators

492
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
and better planners

493
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,880
the third principle i'd like to talk

494
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
about to better balance supply and

495
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,760
demand

496
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
is uh quite honestly is looking back

497
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
hundreds of years it's borrowing

498
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,000
um an idea from the the european middle

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,559
ages

500
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,799
and it's the cyber security guild model

501
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,880
um i believe what we need to do

502
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,319
is to greatly increase the

503
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
the entry level uh opportunities for

504
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,000
people into our

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
our workforce let's bring them in as

506
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
apprentices in large numbers

507
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,600
let's teach them up through training and

508
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
education and experiences

509
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,320
and coach them up and to become

510
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,559
journeymen and some subset of them will

511
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
indeed become masters

512
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,960
um i like this model not only does it

513
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
work for it but it works for the ot

514
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
environment right operational technology

515
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,039
in our critical infrastructures but

516
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,360
importantly it's a it's an enduring

517
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,919
model

518
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
right if you if you get this model going

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
by getting the right number of people in

520
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,559
his apprentices

521
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,400
and you give them opportunities you

522
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
indeed are going to have a sustainable

523
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,559
model for the

524
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,520
uh for many many decades to come so a

525
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
guild model

526
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
that creates a pipeline of people ought

527
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
to be a big part of our collective

528
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,120
strategy

529
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
this next part is something that um

530
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
is i'll call it a call to action

531
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
too many of us when we sit down to

532
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,919
uh describe a a new job that's opening

533
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,640
up

534
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
uh one of the first things first things

535
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
we write down in the cyber security

536
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
community is

537
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
uh requires a four-year degree

538
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
um well i'd like to challenge that the

539
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,960
next time

540
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
you i write a job description let's

541
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
think that through do i really need a

542
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
four-year degree computer science or

543
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
even a four-year degree to do this job

544
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,480
so

545
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
i can think of just very quickly several

546
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
walls that don't require such degrees

547
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,559
right

548
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,120
a role such as a cyber hygienist to keep

549
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
our systems passed

550
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
with the right frequency folks that work

551
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
in operation center

552
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
to look for evidence of potential

553
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
incidents and even first responders you

554
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
can quickly get to the

555
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
scene to help us uh triage what's going

556
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,960
on

557
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
there's you know i just briefly wrote

558
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
these down my point being is that

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
we need to stop uh correct our instincts

560
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,280
and not just start every single job

561
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
description with

562
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
four-year degree required let's give

563
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
more people opportunity to open our

564
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,799
field

565
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,799
by being more careful for how we write

566
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
our job descriptions

567
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
and bring them in and create that

568
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
pipeline that guild model pipeline

569
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,719
i talked about a little bit earlier

570
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
and the fifth area that i wanted to talk

571
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,799
about is of course the importance of

572
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,440
training right it's you can't just

573
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,080
simply

574
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,760
bring in people from different fields

575
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
and expect them to flourish

576
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,799
we need to have some type of um robust

577
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
and escalating training regime to get

578
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
people to better spots to create these

579
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
experts and these masters

580
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,400
of our domain that we talked about

581
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
earlier earlier today

582
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,559
my company fortinet has a a

583
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,400
very robust training program it was

584
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
initially developed for fort netters all

585
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
right so fourtness at this point is a

586
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,640
9 000 person company a very large

587
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
innovative cyber security company

588
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
um but what we realized is that this

589
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,559
training we had it was a gold mine

590
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
and i don't mean in terms of revenue and

591
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,679
i meant in terms of

592
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
getting people to a better spot and

593
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
getting more people in our field

594
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,679
so in the early days of the the coburg

595
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,799
pandemic

596
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
um fortinet opened up its uh nse

597
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,600
training program

598
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
uh for free uh at least for the first

599
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
three levels of it

600
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
and hundreds of thousands of people

601
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
signed up for this training

602
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,720
and what that told us that there's a

603
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
great hunger for people to

604
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
improve themselves try and create more

605
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
opportunities to better their situations

606
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
and they need to do it at their own time

607
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
and pace and so

608
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
making training available at the at

609
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,799
people's uh

610
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
own time and place at higher and higher

611
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,000
levels of sophistication

612
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
needs to be a part of our strategy so

613
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
you know so there you have it

614
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,760
it those would be my five things to

615
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
better balance cyber security

616
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
cyber security skills gap supply and

617
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,480
demand

618
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
let's come up with a different

619
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
definition of diversity and bring in

620
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
more people into our field

621
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
let's better leverage automation

622
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
integration to

623
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
make our jobs less complex and better

624
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,000
use people for the things that they're

625
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
good at and machines for what they're

626
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
good at let's create an enduring

627
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
pipeline model

628
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
um so this isn't just a flash in the pan

629
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
solution

630
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,280
and let's take some personal

631
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
responsibility in defining our job

632
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
descriptions

633
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
so we can bring more people into our

634
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,919
field and train them up

635
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,240
with the right type of uh online

636
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
training

637
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,360
and these are these types of things we

638
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
can do to better uh increase our supply

639
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
and demand

640
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,120
so the pitch is let's address this

641
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
skills gap problem like economics right

642
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,000
it not only solves our cyber security

643
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
skills gap problem and our operations

644
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,400
problem there

645
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280
but it's socially responsible as well um

646
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
it's going to provide people with

647
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,440
opportunity

648
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
that they just don't recognize that they

649
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
have today and that

650
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,799
that's part of our many many of our

651
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,080
nations are having some internal

652
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,440
conflicts right now where

653
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
too many people don't recognize the

654
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,360
opportunities that are out there

655
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,600
um or even that aren't out there so we

656
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
have both an opportunity to

657
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
simultaneously address the skills got

658
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
problem in cyber security

659
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,919
while giving people more hope for the

660
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
future in providing them with such

661
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
opportunities

662
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,480
i've covered the uh you know the five

663
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
big uh

664
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
the five big things of how we can

665
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,400
achieve this

666
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
better balancing supply and demand and

667
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,679
what i'd like to do though is

668
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,080
is end with a perhaps um maybe more

669
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
less methodical a little bit more

670
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,799
inspirational way of looking at the

671
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,840
problem

672
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,159
today we're using cyber security

673
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,200
to enable i.t and ot and even physical

674
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,080
security

675
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
to do really important things that are

676
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
serving as the

677
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
engines of our economies the engines of

678
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
our democracies

679
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
in enabling our uh you know the pursuit

680
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
of happiness by our citizens

681
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
whether it be smart factories safe and

682
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
reliable transportation

683
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
or even better accessible

684
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
health care enabled by technology and we

685
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
ought to feel really really good about

686
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,799
that

687
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,000
um but if we get even better with the

688
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,440
right workforce

689
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
um we can do even more important things

690
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,960
if we integrate

691
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,600
the it domain with the cyber domain and

692
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,799
the physical domain

693
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,200
we can uh help solve some really

694
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
important problems whether they be

695
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
mental problems or physical problems we

696
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,760
can

697
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
uh continue to address the you know

698
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,120
thousand years

699
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
thousand years old scourge of world

700
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,559
hunger by better instrumenting our

701
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
environment or maybe the transportation

702
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
systems for distribution food

703
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,159
and we can address the important issue

704
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
of climate change

705
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,880
by having the right instrumentation of

706
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
the environment and having the right

707
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,240
types of technologies out there

708
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,960
that can help reduce us all we do uh do

709
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
our part to contribute to the solution

710
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,760
this problem

711
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
we can do some really really important

712
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,799
things

713
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
if we master the cyber physical

714
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,919
integration

715
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
opportunity and put in the right

716
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,279
safeguards and

717
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,360
if we create a workforce that's better

718
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,480
postured

719
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,559
both in numbers in training and

720
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,600
diversity

721
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
to work in this environment

722
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
so i thank you for your time today

723
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,000
giving me giving me the opportunity to

724
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,039
talk a little bit about

725
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
uh strategy a little bit about

726
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,240
capabilities

727
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
and hopefully target your heart strings

728
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,000
a little bit to say uh not only do we

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,279
have an important mission problem to

730
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,080
solve right

731
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,279
getting the right um policy and i t i t

732
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
modernization in place for nato to

733
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
better do its operational mission

734
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
but we also have an opportunity and i'll

735
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
say responsibility

736
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
to help address some of the social needs

737
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
that our nations collectively have

738
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,279
uh thank you for your time and if there

739
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,000
are any questions

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
we can we can talk about we can take

741
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,158
them now

742
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:12,320
[Music]

743
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,039
thank you mr quaid for sharing your i

744
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,720
dare say visionary and and rather a

745
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,919
holistic approach to

746
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,279
do all this modernization and

747
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,600
democratization of cyber security

748
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
and indeed there are some questions from

749
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
the audience so let's uh let's take a

750
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
couple of them

751
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
yeah i think the first one that we have

752
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
from the audience is uh when you look

753
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
uh from a cyber security trust

754
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,840
perspective

755
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,600
do you think that cloud computing is

756
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
applicable to government

757
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
institutions and agencies what are the

758
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
risks and advantages of cloud computing

759
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,559
in terms of cyber security

760
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
yeah thank you for the question the uh

761
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,360
the good news is that cloud security is

762
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,720
a great opportunity for

763
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
the government of course the private

764
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,159
sector as well right when

765
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
uh during the past year we all learned

766
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,679
that uh

767
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,039
agility became the foremost principle

768
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,679
of the past year that is where we're

769
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,640
told to be do

770
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
more with less or be told to do more

771
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,320
with different

772
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,679
i mean you know or uh excuse me do

773
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
do more with less do different with the

774
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,120
same right do different things for the

775
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,159
same amount of money

776
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,679
or on occasion we were given large

777
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,600
chunks of money and said i recognize

778
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
that cyber security is a business

779
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,240
enabler uh

780
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,720
spend this money wisely and so what we

781
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,919
learned to value is

782
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
agility right the ability to quickly

783
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
pivot whether it be operations or other

784
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,120
capabilities

785
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,039
and cloud computing allows you to do

786
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
that if you have some core capabilities

787
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,640
that reside physically in your data

788
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,960
center you can quickly instrument and

789
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,600
augment

790
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,440
um augment those things with cloud

791
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,799
computers

792
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
but with capabilities in the cloud the

793
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
company my company that i work for

794
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,320
fortnite

795
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,559
doesn't make governments or users choose

796
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,760
between

797
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
um on-prem versus cloud that that

798
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
shouldn't that's a false choice as

799
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
obama used to say right um it's both

800
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,880
it's not one or the other it's both

801
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,279
so uh the good news is that commercial

802
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,480
capabilities

803
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
uh fortnets allows you to

804
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,279
have a hybrid environment where you have

805
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,799
some on-prem

806
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,880
some in the cloud without increasing

807
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,080
complexity so

808
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
when it comes to cloud computing i'd say

809
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,720
go for it

810
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
it's it it's an important part not the

811
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,240
entire

812
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
solution set but it's an important part

813
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
of your solution set and it doesn't have

814
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
to increase your complexity if you do it

815
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,399
right

816
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,600
the second part of the question had to

817
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,520
do with zero trust zero trust

818
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
is another one of those words that has

819
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,440
um

820
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,240
has sustained the hype cycle what i mean

821
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,520
it's not a hype

822
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,279
there's actually some there there uh the

823
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
changing edge which i talked about

824
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
earlier where people want to connect

825
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,559
any device from anywhere at any time

826
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,240
to any asset that requires a zero trust

827
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
strategy

828
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
that is you want to ingest or allow a

829
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,960
device to connect

830
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,520
but at every point upstream as it moves

831
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
to different parts your network whether

832
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
it be your core or your cloud

833
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,840
you want to be able to verify the

834
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
device's authenticity

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,320
intent and permissions that's what zero

836
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,600
trust is all about

837
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,960
and it's not just a concept it's a very

838
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
very practical thing and the good news

839
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
is that you're probably already doing

840
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,320
you know

841
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,559
two or three of the five required steps

842
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,640
to get to a zero trust environment

843
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
and if you talk to the right people uh

844
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,240
we can help you

845
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
get to the fifth step of xero trust and

846
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
allow you to

847
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
connect all those devices and people

848
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
from anywhere you'd like and do so

849
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
responsibly

850
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,200
thank you and and actually the next

851
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,120
question uh carries on pretty much with

852
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,600
uh

853
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,919
with a similar thought and it asks that

854
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,799
would you agree that the same zero trust

855
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,919
is is not to say no trust but rather it

856
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,760
is layered and aligned with the with the

857
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
critical assets and

858
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
and process to reduce real business

859
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
risks

860
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,480
yep it's it's like i say it does indeed

861
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,799
it's a responsible thing to do

862
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,240
as as we appropriately take more risk

863
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,279
in allowing people on devices to connect

864
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,399
from different places

865
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,559
we have to shift our risk taking

866
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,240
from the edge inside our network that is

867
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
since some of these devices like iot

868
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,960
devices are inherently untrustworthy

869
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,559
because they they didn't have security

870
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,200
built in or for whatever reason

871
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
we don't want to just blindly ingest

872
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,039
them into our network allow them connect

873
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,360
you want to shift your security to other

874
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,799
parts of your network

875
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,240
and that's where you have more robust

876
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,919
security mechanisms built in

877
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,600
that's what xero trust allows you to do

878
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
and importantly that's why that's why i

879
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,039
led my talk off by talking about

880
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,760
the importance of integrated security

881
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,120
unless you have security that

882
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,399
collaborates across

883
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,559
the edge the core and the cloud you

884
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,000
don't have a chance at implementing a

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,279
zero trust strategy

886
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,360
because you can't shift risk and risk

887
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
management to the places of your

888
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,840
strength

889
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,039
you're forced to deal with it

890
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
individually it's a bad strategy so

891
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
yes you can it's important to implement

892
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,159
zero trust for the reasons we've talked

893
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:10,960
about

894
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
but your fundamental strategy is you

895
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
have to have an architecture

896
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
that's based on that is fully integrated

897
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
in order to shift and manage that trust

898
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,840
and integrated more holistic

899
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,279
thank you i think we have time for one

900
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,960
more question and we have one from the

901
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
audience here

902
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,120
uh is the usage of ai just a new

903
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,399
technology that is used in cyber

904
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,200
security

905
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
or do you see it as a big milestone and

906
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,640
if yes why thanks i'm sure that

907
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,840
question's been asked before and i hope

908
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
you're not repeating

909
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,320
anyone um ai is both uh evolutionary and

910
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,600
revolutionary

911
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,440
and um it's it's evolutionary in

912
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
in the fact that machine learning is

913
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,039
here today my company's been

914
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,840
using machine learning for at least five

915
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,399
years

916
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
to look at billions and billions of

917
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,519
pieces of information

918
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,960
that we characterize into threat

919
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,880
intelligence so machine learning the

920
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,039
machine learning aspect of ai is here

921
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,240
today

922
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,159
um full ai of course is not here today

923
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,080
excuse me i i don't want lightning bolt

924
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
to hit me for saying that

925
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,840
um there's lots of different definitions

926
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,039
of ai

927
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,159
um the fullest vision of ai

928
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,840
won't be realized until we have

929
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,279
connected architectures

930
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,440
that allow you to do compute some

931
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
context perhaps in your cloud in your

932
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
core

933
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
move that context out to the edge where

934
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
your physical devices out there in your

935
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
physical domain

936
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,399
could then put it to good use right so

937
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,960
the cyber domain can create context

938
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,360
the physical domain uh where we drive

939
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
cars or work in buildings or

940
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
or whatever is where you could actually

941
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,679
actuate

942
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,440
that information at that point i think

943
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,799
we have something very very close to

944
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,799
most people's definition of ai

945
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,440
that is machines and devices starting to

946
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
look like human behaviors

947
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,919
which which can be enabled by this cyber

948
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,360
physical integration

949
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,720
fast communications like 5g in a fast

950
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,000
and integrated cyber security

951
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
architecture so

952
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,200
it's revolutionary once we get there

953
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,120
and we're collectively as a world

954
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
working our way up into that point

955
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,440
by using machine learning and automation

956
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
but we're rapidly approaching the point

957
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,360
where

958
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,880
we just about any of us would call it ai

959
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,000
thank you mr quaid uh once again for

960
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
for your answers to these questions and

961
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
and also for your presentation

962
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,320
which included rather many novel

963
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
thoughts at the essay

964
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
and certainly when enhancing cyber

965
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
security we need to have a comprehensive

966
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,640
approach

967
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
and and engage a broad scope of

968
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,440
specialists as you highlighted very well

969
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,320
so thank you once again

970
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,019

971
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,519
since perspective sink in and allow you

972
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,880
to get a cup of coffee or stretch your

973
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,519
legs

974
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,679
we'll have a 10 minute break after the

975
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,600
break we will have three parallel

976
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,559
sessions

977
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,679
on stage one the session will be on

978
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
civilian sector vulnerabilities to cyber

979
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:06,960
attacks

head of the strategy branch

982
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,840
of the ccdcoe and on stage two we'll

983
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
have what should be a very interesting

984
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,240
discussion on

985
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,399
ihl principles in the era of new

986
