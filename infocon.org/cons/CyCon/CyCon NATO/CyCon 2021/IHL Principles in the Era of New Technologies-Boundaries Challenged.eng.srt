00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,760
roberts

20

dr adrian venables and joining from

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,320
remote

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
dr monica kamiska

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
and colonel gary corn so welcome to

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
cycon and thank you all to be

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
with us today this session will look

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,560
both at an international humanitarian

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,439
law

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
framework applicable uh to cyber

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
operations

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
to analyze how uh seed in human control

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,159
to artificial intelligence-enabled

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,280
capabilities

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
may affect the existing in

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
framework of the law of armor conflict

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
and it will this will be the topic of

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
the first

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
of the first paper but we look also and

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
this we go to the second paper

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
a peace time regime of cyborg activities

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
to explore with our panelists

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,119
the possibility to draw inspiration

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,520
from international humanitarian law

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
principle of distinction

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
and discrimination to transpose their

45
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
protection

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
into a non-binding norm of responsible

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
state behavior

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
so it will be a sort of the lex ferrand

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
exercise if i can call it this way

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,440
and i can already anticipate that in the

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
panel someone

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
will recommend caution in this sort of

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
exercise

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
so this promise is to be indeed a very

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
interesting panel

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,319
and with an in-depth academic discussion

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
but before we start very briefly a few

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
online house rules uh speakers will tour

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280

via the chat during during the talk

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,160
we'll collect them and

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
give the speakers a few minutes uh to

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,000
answer

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
after each talk um at the end of the

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
session then we will open the floor to a

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,879
more general discussion and you will be

68

also to ask questions to each other

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,840
right

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
without adding anything anything further

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:00,879
i will now

76

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,599
would say

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
feared injects

so anna and adrian your paper provides

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
an excellent i would say overview on

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
of arguments in favor and against

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,080
the military uses of for artificial

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,280
intelligence

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,400
in kinetic targeting and suggesting some

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
original ways of moving the debate

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,600
forward

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
so i will say that the floor is yours

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,199
pleased to hear you thanks max

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
uh good afternoon first of all we'd like

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
to say that we're really really thrilled

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
to be here thank you very much for

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
having us max

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
so first of all i thought it might be

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
helpful we thought it might be helpful

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
to explain why

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,160
exactly we wrote this paper and this

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
is because in our reading in watching

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
media coverage of this issue

131
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
we were really struck that there seemed

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
to be an over emphasis

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
and over focus on lethal autonomous

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,800
weapon systems

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
or laws and this excessive focus on laws

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
was detracting from broader arguments

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
or broader discussion i should say about

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,039
the use of

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
autonomous ai capability by the military

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
in armed conflict and moreover these

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
arguments about laws and ihl compliance

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,039
were often very emotional um talking

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,440
about

144
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
killer robots terminator style machines

145
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
and sometimes quite one-sided so

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
our purpose in writing this paper is

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
actually just to advocate

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
a more balanced approach to this really

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,120
important issue

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
by bringing together all of the

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,479
different arguments

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
and looking at them from both sides

153
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
thank you

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
so for those of you who aren't so

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,080
familiar with the ihl framework or the

156
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
law of armed conflict as we we call it

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
in the military

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
i thought that i would just really

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
briefly set out the ihl framework for

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
targeting

161
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
to help our conversation the framework

162
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
is underpinned by the four fundamental

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,039
principles that you see

164
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,520
on the slide out of these the two most

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
important

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
principles for the purposes of this

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,199
discussion

168
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
are humanity and distinction ah rather

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
sorry distinction and proportionality

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
distinction distinction means that we

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
must be able to

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
draw a very clear difference between

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
civilians and civilian objects

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
and military targets and this is of

175
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,639
course because civilians and civilian

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
objects must not be attacked

177
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
they are protected under ihl accordingly

178
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,280
when planning an attack

179
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,759
a military commander must do everything

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
possible to confirm that a target

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,039
is military and not in fact civilian

182
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
the military commander must also take

183
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
all feasible precautions when planning

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,160
an attack

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
to make sure that there are no

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
incidental civilian

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,639
losses however as we know this is

188
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
sometimes unavoidable

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
and this is where the principle of

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
proportionality comes into play

191
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,560
proportionality says dictates

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
that civilian losses incidental civilian

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
losses

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
must not be excessive in relation to the

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
expected military advantage

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
and so on this basis the military

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
commander is is conducting a weighing

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
exercise between the competing

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,720
humanitarian and military interests

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,120
but what is key to to draw from

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
what we've just talked about is that it

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,319
is the military commander's own judgment

203
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,680
and experience that count the military

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
commander makes the decisions about

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
distinction and proportionality

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
drawing on his his own judgment his

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
experience

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
and this is a key point in this

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,919
discussion and we'll talk about it

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
further the military commander is of

211
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
course i should say advised

212
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
at all times by his legal officer his

213
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
intelligence officer

214
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
uh the targeteers but ultimately is the

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,160
military

216
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,720
commander's decision on these issues and

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,199
the military commander is accountable

218
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,960
and on that basis it's also important to

219
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,639
note that attack

220
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,120
must be kept under constant review so if

221
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
the distinction and proportionality

222
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
assessment changes

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
then the attack must be suspended or

224
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,000
cancelled

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
and finally on this slide i want to

226
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,559
mention article 36 of additional

227
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,519
protocol 1

228
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
to the geneva conventions and this

229
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
mandates that there must be a legal

230
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
review of all new weapons

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
means and methods of warfare now there

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,279
is

233
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,080
debate on the scope of this provision

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,839
and who it applies to but the key

235
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,480
takeaway

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,440
is that ihl already has an inbuilt

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
mechanism

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
to deal with new technology

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
so we looked at three particular aspects

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
um looking at

241
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
the use of autonomous artificial

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,480
intelligence

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,440
the first is is laws and there is no

244
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,519
official definition for the laws is

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,680
so what you see on the slide is our

246
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
definition for the purposes of the paper

247
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
and this is essentially a weapon system

248
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
which independently selects

249
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
and use force against the target based

250
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,480
upon

251
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
its own algorithms machine learning

252
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
taking inputs from the environment

253
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
making a decision

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
and targeting without a human in the

255
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,279
loop

256
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,200
the second element we looked at was

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
intelligent surveillance

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
and and reconnaissance and this would

259
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,240
have

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,640
an autonomous system being able to

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
assimilate

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
more information than a human would be

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
able to do we'll be able to assess it

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
against its machine learning algorithms

265
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,320
and come up

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
with solutions which would assist

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
a targeting process the final element we

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,160
looked at

269
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
was information operations and that is

270
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,279
where we look

271
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,000
at information as the weapon and as the

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
tool

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
and this is where we would look at

274
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
mostly perhaps online information

275
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
and looking at um social media looking

276
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
at some of the sentiment analysis

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,320
and this is where the information is

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
interpreted

279
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
and using that we can then identify or

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
the machine can identify

281
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
the best way to affect the will

282
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
understanding and capability of a target

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
again without a human in the loop

284
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,720
so moving on to the arguments about the

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
use of autonomous ai capability

286
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
looking first of all from the

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
perspective of the law

288
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,839
and the key legal concern expressed

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,920
about autonomous ai capability in the

290
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
military context

291
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
is that such capability simply can't

292
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,720
comply

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
with ihl and particularly the principles

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
of proportionality and distinction

295
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
and this is because ihl relies upon

296
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
that human judgment experience and

297
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
control

298
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,120
that we talked about earlier and there

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,920
is no doubt

300
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,040
that the issue of distinction is is a

301
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
challenging one

302
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,959
even for humans

303
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,519
in the types of conflicts we see now the

304
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,640
adversary

305
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
is very often indistinguishable from the

306
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
civilian population

307
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
and will habitually alternate between

308
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
targetable status

309
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
when taking a direct part in hostilities

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
and non-targetable status

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
when assessing whether someone is taking

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
a direct part in hostilities

313
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
we have to look not just at the activity

314
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
that person is carrying out

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,079
but also at the broader operational

316
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,440
context

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,079
so for example how will a machine be

318
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,240
able to distinguish between

319
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
celebratory weapons fire and hostile

320
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,839
weapons fire

321
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
how will a machine be able to

322
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,880
distinguish between

323
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,360
somebody carrying a weapon for hostile

324
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
purposes

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,399
or somebody taking a weapon to a police

326
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,600
station as part

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
of a weapons amnesty and the point is

328
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,279
that commentators say that to be able to

329
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,000
do this

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
you need to apply human intelligence

331
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
to be able to understand somebody's

332
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,920
state of mind

333
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
and there is some strength in that

334
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
argument

335
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,720
and similarly in relation to

336
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
proportionality issues how is a machine

337
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
going to be able to assess

338
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,800
the value of human life against a

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
military target

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
noting that the value of a military

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
target target

342
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
is going to be context dependent and and

343
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
will change according to the operational

344
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
circumstances

345
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,560
to respond to that within ihl targeting

346
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
rules

347
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
it is not actually specifically stated

348
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
that there has to be a human in the loop

349
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
and so the key point is can a capability

350
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
comply with the rules if so

351
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
it is legal and to assist with that and

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
article 36

353
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
legal review could be conducted and if

354
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
compliant

355
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
then it may be used we can argue

356
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
that actually autonomous systems can

357
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,639
enhance

358
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
the legal compliance for example

359
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
in isr we could have improved target

360
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
identification

361
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
using sophisticated algorithms and

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
machine learning

363
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
it could be able to differentiate

364
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
between

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
a pipe bomb and just someone laying a

366
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
pipe

367
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
by the side of the road within

368
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
information operations

369
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
by using highly complex machine learning

370
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
it may be possible in a very timely

371
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
manner to identify

372
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
the best way to

373
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
affect the capability will and

374
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
understanding of a target audience

375
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
to enable them to behave in a certain

376
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,279
way such as moving

377
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,399
out of a target area or indeed affecting

378
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
the intended target to stay where he is

379
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,800
where he is safe to be targeted

380
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
and for laws the key point is that

381
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,480
if a system is constantly monitoring its

382
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
targeting process

383
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
it is able to abort or delay an attack

384
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
according to its algorithms and how it

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
chooses to uh

386
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,240
to respond to certain stimuli

387
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
but even if it can be demonstrated that

388
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
a capability

389
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
can comply with ihl and particularly

390
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,440
proportionality and distinction there is

391
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
still significant

392
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,440
opposition to the use of such capability

393
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,199
on ethical grounds

394
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,680
and this is because it is felt that

395
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,560
ceding

396
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,440
life and death decisions to a machine

397
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,279
will lead to the dehumanization of

398
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,079
warfare

399
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
with military decision-making stripped

400
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,880
of all emotion

401
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,959
it is also suggested by some

402
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,440
commentators the human conscience

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
often acts as a final barrier against

404
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
taking life

405
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
an example of this when i was in

406
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
afghanistan in 2009

407
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
the military commander there issued a

408
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
policy um

409
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
which directed military personnel to

410
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
exercise restraint

411
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
in their use of force even in situations

412
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,079
where

413
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
force could be legally applied and in

414
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,760
situations where

415
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
this would put yourself at risk or your

416
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,279
colleagues

417
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
and this was to spare the civilian

418
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,480
population

419
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
so this issue of conscience is important

420
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
how will a machine without a conscience

421
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,920
be able to determine

422
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
when it is appropriate to exercise

423
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,519
restraint

424
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,800
of course you could argue that in

425
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,519
response to that autonomous systems can

426
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,880
actually improve

427
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
international humanitarian law

428
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
compliance in that humans

429
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
are emotional and in the stress of

430
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:49,920
battle

431
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
they may perform and they may react

432
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,480
by fear anger exhaustion depending upon

433
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
what they've seen how they feel they may

434
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
be distracted

435
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
of course an autonomous system isn't

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
affected by that

437
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
it responds objectively in accordance

438
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
with its algorithms

439
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
in accordance with its machine learning

440
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,160
24 hours a day

441
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
seven days a week irrespective of what

442
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,759
is happening around it

443
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
and so you're going to get a more

444
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
consistent response

445
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,839
in any given environment

446
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
now moving on to to technical arguments

447
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,920
it has been shown

448
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
that um autonomous systems can be biased

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
and that depends upon the training data

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,880
they're given

451
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
if you're using training data that was

452
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
designed to be used in one theater

453
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
in another theater the system may not

454
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
respond

455
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
as you anticipate or as you would want

456
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,240
to be compliant the system may be

457
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
unreliable unpredictable because it's

458
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,399
not working to a set program

459
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,160
it's machine learning and it's

460
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
responding in accordance with algorithms

461
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,000
and stimuli it could be unpredictable

462
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
and because of that there is an issue

463
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,519
with accountability

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,760
in that if it responds in a certain way

465
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,720
it may be impossible to actually explain

466
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
how it came to a particular decision

467
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
because it's just not working through

468
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,280
lines of code

469
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
it's interpreting the situation and

470
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
coming to its own decisions

471
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,880
but of course my answer to this is that

472
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,799
ihl already has an inbuilt mechanism

473
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
to catch issues such as this if

474
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,600
an article 36 legal review is conducted

475
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
correctly there should be no question of

476
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
a capability

477
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
exhibiting characteristics such as

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,039
adrian has explained

479
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,799
ever coming into service because the

480
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,879
review is there to stop that

481
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
building on this i would also stress the

482
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,760
importance of involving military league

483
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
ads in the capability development

484
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
process

485
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
as early as possible and this is to

486
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,000
ensure that ihl

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
compliance is baked in to the design

488
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,280
process as opposed to an afterthought

489
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
and so finally in in conclusion

490
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
we totally agree that ai

491
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,120
in targeting the use of automate

492
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
autonomous ai capability

493
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,880
does raise issues about ihl compliance

494
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,679
however by the same token some

495
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,480
capability

496
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,919
could in fact improve ihl compliance

497
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
and this is too important an argument to

498
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,600
simply discard

499
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,960
or gloss over as some commentators do

500
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
the fact is that a capability

501
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
must be judged on its own merits we must

502
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
avoid

503
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
over-generalization and supposition

504
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
about what a capability

505
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
an autonomous ai capability may or may

506
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,960
not be able to do

507
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
as i've said ihl already has a mechanism

508
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
to address concerns about ihl

509
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
compliance and this is where in our view

510
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
international efforts should really

511
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,000
focus on strengthening that process

512
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
and of course as i've said lawyers

513
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
should be involved

514
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
early as early as possible in the

515
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
development

516
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
and and finally we would just like to to

517
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
reiterate that

518
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,039
polarized emotional debate is unhelpful

519
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,520
in this really important topic we need a

520
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,160
sensible

521
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
and balanced discussion thank you

522
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,960
thank you anastasia and adrian for this

523
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,320
wonderful presentation i have already

524
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,840
some questions aside for you for adrian

525
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
to start with

526
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
we've been speaking of

527
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,520
automatic and autonomous capabilities

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,640
could you clarify

529
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
what is the difference and pay up

530
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,159
between them and perhaps later we can

531
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,960
also

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
examine the possible implication in

533
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
terms of an operational and

534
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
legal implications but now the

535
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
difference on the difference between the

536
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,559
two

537
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,000
yes of course max automated systems are

538
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
commonly used in in servicenow a good

539
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,760
example

540
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,559
would be a closing weapon system so it's

541
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
a system where essentially you feed it

542
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,880
a power supply and chilled water you

543
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
turn it on

544
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,559
and it will defend the ship about the um

545
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,720
a sea wiz closing weapon system

546
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
but that system works through lines of

547
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,760
code

548
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,320
it will identify targets it will track

549
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,200
targets

550
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
and it will determine if it's a threat

551
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,840
in accordance with a set of parameters

552
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,919
which a human has coded based upon

553
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,440
whether it's a crossing target

554
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
whether it's in certain speed brackets

555
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
whether it's a coming straight straight

556
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
towards your your ship

557
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
at a certain height but these are highly

558
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,320
governed an autonomous system

559
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
essentially you are teaching it

560
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,559
how to learn you're providing it with a

561
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
number of algorithms in which

562
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
you say this is what you need to

563
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,799
interpret and then you feed it

564
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,919
training data and then the system then

565
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,760
looks at a different environment

566
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,159
uses that own training data and then

567
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
determines whether or not it can

568
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
it can engage or make the uh the kinetic

569
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,720
targeting

570
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,760
excellent thank you adrian one question

571
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,320
for

572
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
anna in your paper you address the issue

573
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
of the applicability um to artificial

574
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,080
intelligence

575
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
used in kinetic targeting of article

576
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
36 of the additional protocol one to the

577
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
geneva conventions

578
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
which required as we know and as you say

579
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
state parties to review new weapons

580
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
means or method of warfare

581
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,640
to ensure their compliance with ihl when

582
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,520
you examine

583
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,000
this issue uh you offer also an analysis

584
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,720
of three

585
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
different potential military use of

586
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,159
artificial

587
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
intelligence in the targeting process

588
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,600
and you emphasize also the relevance of

589
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
this differentiation

590
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
for the positive possible implication on

591
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,440
the applicability of article

592
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
36 so could you

593
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
summarize a bit the outcome of this

594
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
analysis with the particular

595
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
um reference to the implication of this

596
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,280
differentiation

597
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,200
i'll try and the key issue

598
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,080
with article 36 is as you know is that

599
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
ap1 itself does not contain a definition

600
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,679
of what

601
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,240
a weapon is what means what means are

602
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
and what methods are

603
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,520
it's quite easy to identify what a

604
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,159
weapon is

605
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,480
so laws would clearly be a weapon

606
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
because it has that ability

607
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,039
to to use force to take human life

608
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,480
but what isn't quite so clear is is what

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,960
a

610
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,559
method of warfare is

611
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,760
in ap1 it talks about methods of warfare

612
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
in relation to

613
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
how a weapon is used so it's all very

614
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
weapons focused

615
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,520
but the point is that what we've just

616
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
talked about with

617
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
um autonomous ai capability for use in

618
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
isr and io for use in the legal

619
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
targeting process

620
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
this brings those capabilities into the

621
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,159
mix as well

622
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,880
and currently i i don't think it's very

623
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,600
clear

624
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,960
whether or not those those capabilities

625
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
should be subject to an article 36

626
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,600
review

627
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
i mean i think they should be i think

628
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,200
they are going to be supporting the

629
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,039
targeting process

630
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,520
and therefore they should be reviewed

631
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
because although the concern

632
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
is voiced about laws it's equally

633
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,640
applicable

634
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
to isr and io for example

635
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,039
as adrian discussed isr capabilities

636
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
it could an isr capability could

637
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
identify the wrong person

638
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
it could identify a civilian as a target

639
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600
um an i o capability could

640
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,840
act perfidiously to entice um

641
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,159
a target into a particular area

642
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,240
so we need to make sure that these

643
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
capabilities

644
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
are as compliant with ihl as

645
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
weapons and this is where i think in as

646
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
i said international

647
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,320
focus should should really be does that

648
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,080
help does that answer

649
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,159
very interesting thank you thank you

650
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,600
anna thank you and while

651
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,159
we have the questions from the audience

652
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
should we consider

653
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,000
an artificial intelligence and machine

654
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
learning decision making independent

655
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,480
to the international humanitarian law

656
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
and therefore the enemy support use

657
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
of artificial intelligence and machine

658
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,840
learning

659
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
would you agree that ethical war

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,600
fighters may lose the war

661
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,720
i'll start with that i think having the

662
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
moral high ground and being

663
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,919
in the right is extremely important um

664
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,840
yes you can sink to the lowest common

665
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
denominator and fight dirty however

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
in nato we are fighting

667
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
legally we are following the law

668
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
and of course we do have a domestic

669
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
audience

670
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,520
at home that we have to influence and

671
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,080
keep on

672
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,919
site and so we need to demonstrate

673
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,960
globally that that nato is a

674
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,159
ethical law-abiding alliance

675
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,120
and that it is not afraid of using the

676
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
latest technology

677
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
machine learning autonomous systems

678
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,919
however it does so

679
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,000
in a responsible ethical and legal

680
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
manner

681
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,919
absolutely i i agree with that when we

682
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
were discussing the ethical arguments we

683
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
weren't suggesting

684
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,600
at any point that we shouldn't apply

685
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
ethics in the use of force as far as ihl

686
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,919
is concerned that

687
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,679
the legality and the ethics are are

688
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
intertwined as we know

689
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,400
um yeah i i don't think i can add

690
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
anything much more to

691
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,559
oh adrian said to be honest but but you

692
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,120
i think it would be wrong to suggest

693
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,240
that fighting ethically will lead to

694
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
losing the war fighting ethically could

695
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
never lead to losing a war

696
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,679
if you have the the moral

697
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,360
high ground and the support of the of

698
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
the people that you're fighting for

699
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
hopefully not thank you thank you anna

700
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
we have the last question for

701
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,279
this panel now could you comment on the

702
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,600
concerns of a cyber attack or other

703
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
interference with the artificial

704
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,159
intelligence

705
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,279
to intentionally create unpredictability

706
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,000
for example tape on a road sign

707
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
resulting in self-driving cars

708
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,440
misidentifying design so

709
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
again i think i think that is a a

710
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
perfect example

711
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,480
of what an article 36 legal review

712
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,760
should be looking at

713
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,520
not only whether um capability is

714
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,240
compliant

715
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
with ihl but also making sure that it is

716
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,159
protected

717
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,320
from outside interference so that its

718
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,919
use can be perverted

719
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,360
but you probably have a better technical

720
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,960
background than me yes i

721
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,520
um working work is being done to look at

722
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
how to uh to defeat

723
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,400
um autonomous self-driving self-driving

724
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,279
vehicles

725
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,919
and this is a very good example and this

726
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,720
is where

727
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,440
research development understanding but

728
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,840
also

729
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,960
looking at at the wider context so

730
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
a autonomous car shouldn't be just

731
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,240
looking

732
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,279
at a sign but it should also be able to

733
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,240
interpret

734
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
where it is perhaps by gps looking at

735
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
the road map and looking to be able

736
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,840
to understand that this is where it

737
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,200
needs to

738
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
stop and give way so it's not just

739
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,000
a a single um a single stimulus

740
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,159
in which it makes a decision and of

741
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,320
course this leads on to the point that

742
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,200
we don't have fully autonomous systems

743
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,840
yet

744
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
we have automated systems but not

745
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
autonomy autonomous systems

746
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
and so um the research development and

747
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
the ongoing understanding

748
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,600
is being done and these are just the

749
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
issues which need to be taken into

750
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,080
account

751
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
as part of the 30 article 36 review

752
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,480
wonderful thank you indeed uh

753
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,399
i think there's much more here to

754
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,640
discuss but in the interest of

755
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
our time i would suggest to move on

756
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,399
we have other questions for our

757
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,600
panelists

758
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,678
but now next up is dr monica kaminska

759
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,200
hello monica welcome to cycon

760
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,000
hi max nice nice to see you um hello to

761
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
everyone

762
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,120
are you able to hear me

763
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,279
yes we can hear you yes we can

764
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,320
okay perfect so um

765
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
hopefully you can also see my slides yes

766
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,039
now we left them up

767
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,440
first a little introduction for you

768
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
monica is a postdoctoral

769
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
researcher at the ago program for cyber

770
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
norms at leiden university

771
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
institute of security and global affairs

772
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,760
and a phd candidate in cyber security

773
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,559
at the university of oxford monica's

774
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,760
research focuses in

775
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
international cyber conflicts and state

776
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,679
responses to style cyber operations

777
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,880
monica your paper co-authored with fabio

778
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,799
cristiano and dennis breder

779
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,600
identify identifies an issue of concern

780
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,320
of states

781
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
namely automatic malware that

782
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,799
self-propagates to infect

783
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,760
cyber infrastructures and that provokes

784
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
undecidable widespread

785
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
damage and effects so the paper

786
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
advocates adopting a non-binding norm to

787
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,640
review

788
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,960
automated cyber operation in condition

789
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,240
short of armed conflict

790
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
on the lock based on the local law of

791
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,120
army conflict obligation to distinguish

792
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,600
between

793
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
military objectives and civilian

794
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,919
objectives

795
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,480
so it's uh i called it you see an

796
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
exercise of the lex ferenda

797
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,880
but now please the floor is yours we are

798
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,760
all here

799
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,559
thank you thank you so much

800
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,200
uh so yes i'll um this people's cool

801
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
thing with my colleagues fabio

802
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,120
christendom

803
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,679
and um venice brothers and i thought i'd

804
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,200
just start with

805
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,480
uh observations that really motivated us

806
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,360
to write about

807
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,080
regulating automated cyber operations

808
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,600
and i should just stress here

809
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,080
that we looked at automated so not

810
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,279
autonomous operations

811
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,000
um like uh and adrian we've talked about

812
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
before

813
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,840
so first of all we noticed that states

814
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,399
regard

815
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,360
automated cyber operations as a problem

816
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,039
so in the case of not petya

817
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,679
in 2017 which was perhaps the most

818
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,320
infamous

819
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,679
automated operation the us and the uk

820
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,760
both criticized the indiscriminate

821
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,600
design of the operation

822
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
and mentioned that in their attribution

823
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,880
statements

824
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
and then in the un open-ended working

825
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
group states like brazil

826
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
ecuador and the netherlands have also

827
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,559
voiced their concerns

828
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,519
about the uncontrolled spread of cyber

829
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,640
operations

830
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,919
and the international committee of the

831
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,159
red cross in addressing the open-ended

832
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,120
working group

833
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,039
already stated that during armed

834
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,440
conflict the employment of cyber tools

835
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,240
that spread

836
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,559
and cause damage indiscriminately is

837
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,399
prohibited

838
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
but the problem is of course that

839
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
existing international humanitarian law

840
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
does not regulate conduct below the

841
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,559
threshold of armed conflict

842
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
so we don't have this kind of clarity

843
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,240
for automated operations

844
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,799
like not petcha or also wannacry so

845
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,760
operations that

846
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,559
occurred below the threshold and since

847
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,760
we wrote the paper

848
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,960
the microsoft exchange hack happened so

849
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
discussing the regulation of automated

850
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,559
cyber operations

851
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,559
just seems all the more timely

852
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,399
so what's the main argument of the paper

853
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,240
well as max already said drawing

854
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,440
inspiration from

855
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,080
existing legal principles in ihl we

856
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,399
propose a new non-binding norm

857
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
to address automated cyber attacks below

858
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,399
the threshold of armed conflict

859
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,240
so essentially we propose that states

860
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
should design cyber operations

861
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,840
so as to prevent them from

862
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
indiscriminately inflicting damage

863
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,200
and as i said the norm draws inspiration

864
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
from international law

865
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,919
particularly the principle of

866
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,840
distinction or discrimination

867
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,559
but it also deviates from it in one

868
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,480
important respect so as

869
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
anna already mentioned the principle of

870
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,600
distinction

871
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
requires parties to armed conflicts to

872
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,679
distinguish at all times

873
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
between military objectives and civilian

874
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,600
objects

875
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,679
our proposed norm doesn't distinguish

876
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,799
between lawful and

877
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,399
unlawful objects as categories instead

878
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,960
any operation that does not seek to

879
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,440
target

880
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
a malware's payload at a particular

881
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
system

882
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
so that is an operation that lacks any

883
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
form of distinction or discrimination

884
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,440
would be considered a violation of the

885
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
norm so it's essentially a negative

886
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,399
north

887
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,159
and norms have been constructed in this

888
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,919
way before so for example

889
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,640
many of the norms in the 2015 ungg

890
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,399
report are reiterations of legal

891
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,159
principles such as the principle of due

892
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,919
diligence or respect for human rights

893
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,880
law

894
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,240
and it's important to note here that

895
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
we're not actually international lawyers

896
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,080
so

897
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,000
what we're not doing in the paper is

898
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,519
interpreting international law

899
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,200
we're instead proposing a new

900
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
non-binding norm merely drawing

901
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,240
inspiration from

902
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
ihl so how would compliance with this

903
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,519
norm look in practice and to this end we

904
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,279
propose a normative review

905
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,760
of automated cyber operations and once

906
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
again we draw here inspiration from the

907
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
legal review of weapons in ihl

908
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,159
and in coming up with this review we

909
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
actually came across an issue

910
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,000
in detaching indiscriminate use from

911
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
indiscriminate nature which is something

912
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
that is referred to in article 36 of the

913
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,720
additional protocol

914
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,399
and also in the talon manual in its

915
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,919
translation of existing

916
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,039
law into a cyber context we found

917
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,200
that the distinction between the nature

918
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,799
and the use of weapons

919
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,200
is actually empty for automated cyber

920
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,480
operations

921
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
and this is because automated cyber

922
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
attacks propagate and detect

923
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,639
unpatched vulnerabilities and discus

924
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,719
deliver their payload automatically

925
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
so therefore their intentionality

926
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,159
becomes a question of pure design so in

927
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
other words if we were to also consider

928
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,800
use

929
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,399
there is a risk that automation can

930
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,480
become a justification for states

931
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,839
to avoid responsibility so the normative

932
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,119
review that we propose

933
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,359
would therefore prioritize an assessment

934
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,239
of the design

935
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,440
or nature of cyber capabilities over

936
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,879
their use and to comply with this new

937
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,440
norm

938
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
states would undertake a review of each

939
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
operation to ascertain that the design

940
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,399
of the operation

941
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
reflects their intent to limit

942
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,239
uncontrolled harmful effects

943
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,000
including the destruction of data

944
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,400
so how could we hold norm violators

945
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,760
accountable

946
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,320
the paper argued that the post-incident

947
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,599
forensic analysis

948
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,079
of an operation can allow third parties

949
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,839
and victims to determine whether an

950
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,920
attacker conformed to the norm with

951
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
with regard to the operations design and

952
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,119
nature

953
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,040
and states can then use these forensic

954
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
analyses to call out

955
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,200
unacceptable behavior which then helps

956
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
set a normative benchmark

957
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,160
so what we did in the paper is we

958
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
compared the not patcher and stuxnet

959
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,880
operations

960
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,480
to illustrate just how this could be

961
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,000
done so

962
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
let's start with nopeta an analysis of

963
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
not petch's initial method of delivery

964
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,359
reveals that already at this stage it

965
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,240
was designed

966
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,119
not to discriminate between systems so

967
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,040
the attackers compromised the software

968
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,000
update system

969
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,880
for the me doc financial application and

970
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,520
me doc

971
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,359
is the most popular accounting software

972
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,680
in ukraine and is used widely by any

973
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,520
organization that files taxes

974
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,400
or conducts business in the country so

975
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,480
the attacker's choice of emidoc as the

976
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
attack vector

977
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,599
already gives us a clue that the

978
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,520
attackers might not have paid attention

979
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,079
to distinguishing between targets

980
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,079
but it isn't yet enough to determine

981
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,560
whether the operation was indiscriminate

982
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,640
because from analyzing just this stage

983
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,160
we don't actually yet know if the

984
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
attacker sought to exploit all the

985
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
organizations

986
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
that it accessed so let's consider two

987
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,440
subsequent stages of the operation

988
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
the lateral movement stage when the

989
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,280
adversary moves from one system to the

990
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
next within the network

991
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
and the impact stage where the malware's

992
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
payload interrupts systems

993
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,599
or destroys data so in order to

994
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,359
propagate across systems

995
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
not petite used two tools a modified

996
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
version of a tool called minicats

997
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,440
which was used to steal login

998
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
credentials from computer memory

999
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
and the eternal blue exploit which

1000
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,280
allowed the attackers to remotely infect

1001
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
all the systems on a given network

1002
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,400
within minutes

1003
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,240
and the malware also crucially had no

1004
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
mechanism to distinguish between targets

1005
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
prior to installing its payload so once

1006
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
it had spread to a new host it

1007
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,599
automatically scanned other systems for

1008
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,640
their vulnerability

1009
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,480
to eternal blue in order to

1010
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
automatically release

1011
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,800
its payload there as well so these two

1012
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,520
stages

1013
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,760
the lateral movement and impact stage

1014
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,040
taken together

1015
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
indicate that the designers of not petya

1016
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,800
did not seek to limit

1017
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,599
in any way the uncontrolled harmful

1018
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,640
effects of the malware

1019
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,359
let's now look at stuxnet which famously

1020
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,800
targeted iran's

1021
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,520
natanz nuclear enrichment plan and let's

1022
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,280
start again with the initial access

1023
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
stage

1024
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
so the attackers recruited a mole to

1025
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
physically infect

1026
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,920
a usb flash drive with the malware which

1027
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
was then plugged into the centrifuge

1028
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,520
systems at the plant

1029
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,760
and we know from investigative reporting

1030
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,599
that the mall had visited natanz a

1031
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,280
number of times in order to collect

1032
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,560
detailed information

1033
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
on the configuration of its systems

1034
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
prior to delivering the malware on the

1035
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
usb drive

1036
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,359
and this allowed the attackers to update

1037
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,720
the code several times

1038
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,440
before launching the operation an

1039
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
analysis of the intrusion vector for

1040
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
this first version of stuxset

1041
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
reveals that it was designed essentially

1042
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
as a precision attack so the malware was

1043
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,480
injected

1044
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,599
into only one target network in the

1045
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,160
second

1046
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
iteration of the operation rather than

1047
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,839
using a mole

1048
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,000
the attackers infected the systems of

1049
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,920
five unwitting external nutan's

1050
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,440
contractors

1051
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,280
and this is actually what caused the

1052
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,760
malware to spread outside natanz

1053
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
so now we're looking at the lateral

1054
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,880
movement stage

1055
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,720
although the malware was designed to

1056
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,640
only propagate automatically in

1057
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
so-called trusted networks

1058
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,000
the infection of the contractor's

1059
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
systems meant that the malware spread to

1060
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,280
the contractors

1061
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,000
other customers and ultimately ended up

1062
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,920
infecting over a hundred thousand

1063
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,960
computer systems globally but

1064
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
if we compare the lateral movement

1065
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,040
stages of the notpetya and stuxnet

1066
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,000
operation

1067
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,720
there is one crucial difference while

1068
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,440
the malware spread in both cases

1069
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
stuxnet did not destroy any systems that

1070
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,480
were not its intended target

1071
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,560
because it was designed to only deliver

1072
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,880
its payload to specific types of

1073
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,680
programmable

1074
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,119
logic controller devices so when stuxnet

1075
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,920
detected

1076
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,400
a series of specific configurations

1077
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
which verified its target system

1078
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,800
it released its payload causing the

1079
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
programmable logic controllers

1080
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
to run at different speeds when it did

1081
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,680
not

1082
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,720
it withheld the payload so even though

1083
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,320
stuxnet spread like a worm

1084
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
it did not have the uncontrolled harmful

1085
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,240
effects as the malware did not

1086
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
automatically release the payload

1087
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,520
in systems outside of nutans so on this

1088
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
basis we can conclude that because

1089
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
stuxnet withheld its payload outside

1090
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,400
natanz

1091
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
the avoidance of indiscriminate harmful

1092
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,680
effects was integral to its design

1093
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,160
so comparing not petra and stuxnet we

1094
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,359
can determine that the

1095
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,079
incorporation of propagation mechanisms

1096
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,680
into the malware in itself

1097
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,760
does not actually necessarily indicate

1098
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
the attacker's lack of intent

1099
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,839
to limit the operation instead it was

1100
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,359
the propagation coupled with the

1101
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,200
malware's automatic release of the

1102
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,920
payload

1103
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
that showed the attackers inattention to

1104
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,599
discrimination and would therefore

1105
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
constitute a violation

1106
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,560
of our proposed norm so with that

1107
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
um i'll leave the presentation there and

1108
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,359
welcome any questions

1109
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,720
thank you monica thank you my question

1110
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
if the assumption in your paper is that

1111
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,839
a payload capable of distinction

1112
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,119
um deployed in peacetime would not be

1113
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,359
a lawful because compliant with this

1114
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,960
non-binding norm

1115
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,280
wouldn't such a norm implicitly amid the

1116
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,680
possibility to conduct archaeological

1117
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
cyber operation but nonetheless

1118
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,960
destructive in peace time

1119
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,680
yeah so that's a really good question

1120
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,520
and it really gets to the issue of

1121
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,640
to what extent are destructive

1122
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,359
cyber operations cyber operations with

1123
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,079
destructive

1124
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,200
effects ever permissible in peacetime

1125
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,240
um so if we think about stuxnet i

1126
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,200
suspect that

1127
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,680
today states would refer to stuxnet

1128
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,480
quite differently

1129
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
than they did um back when it was

1130
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,920
discovered

1131
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,040
so i think that what our you know what

1132
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,760
our norms

1133
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,319
tries to do is to give states the tool

1134
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,920
that they seem to be needing so they're

1135
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,839
really concerned about these

1136
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,400
um indiscriminate cyber attacks so it

1137
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,079
gives them a tool to call out

1138
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,319
indiscriminate cyber attacks and say

1139
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,760
this is not okay because this

1140
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,680
contravenes this norm

1141
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,920
that doesn't mean that that these kinds

1142
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,319
of attacks destructive attacks are okay

1143
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,480
um it just means that states need other

1144
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,000
tools to address them and i think

1145
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
those tools many already exist right so

1146
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
so states already

1147
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,520
um apply sovereignty in the use of force

1148
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,040
in calling out destructive

1149
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
uh cyber attacks so um yeah i think that

1150
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,560
sort of kind of thing

1151
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,599
thank you indeed monica

1152
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,760

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,359
and besides this and let me say it with

1171

a pinch of pride

1172
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,680
gary is also together with professor

1173
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,480
sean watts the main instructor at the

ccdcoe

1177
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,079
so gary working with emerging

1178
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
technologies for several years you

1179
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,839
published many articles

1180
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,280
on the topics addressed by the two

1181
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,880
papers today

1182
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,200
um where under one perspective you

1183
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
maintain that this new reality of

1184
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
artificial intelligence should not be

1185
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,760
seen necessarily um solely viewed solely

1186
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,880
through a negative or alarmist lens uh

1187
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
while under another's perspective you

1188
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,480
often issued

1189
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,440
some sort of precautionary notes to

1190
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,119
apply to new technologies

1191
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,960
legal frameworks that are aware

1192
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,599
developed in different eras and contexts

1193
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,680
so i'm referring particular to one

1194
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,440
article of yours but there are many

1195
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,920
others

1196
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,040
on cyber operation in the imperfect art

1197
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,000
of translating

1198
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,920
the law of war to new technologies

1199
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
so gary please the virtual stage is

1200
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,480
yours

1201
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,480
again thanks max thanks to scicon for

1202
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,599
letting me participate today and more

1203
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,359
importantly

1204
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:59,599
congratulations to my fellow

1205
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,680
presenters panelists for their very

1206
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,720
thoughtful and

1207
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
thought-provoking papers and really

1208
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
excellent presentations

1209
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,920
a little slight note of clarification um

1210
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,440
to the introduction and thanks for the

1211
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,119
kind words max but

1212
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,240
uh my my writing has focused mostly

1213
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,920
on cyber operations hybrid capabilities

1214
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,359
as a new technology and emerging

1215
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,000
technology

1216
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,119
i have not delved into the

1217
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,040
really challenging and difficult area of

1218
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
artificial intelligence

1219
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,480
um and especially within the law of arm

1220
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,200
conflict framework

1221
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
so let me get that acknowledgment out

1222
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,240
there although i think some of what i'm

1223
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,839
going to talk about

1224
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,240
does have applicability and i and i know

1225
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,040
and i

1226
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,319
sort of um congratulate

1227
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,040
anastasia and adrian in their their

1228
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
cautionary note itself i think in

1229
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,720
in the tenor of the the article in the

1230
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,480
presentation that that

1231
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,079
there may be um positive uses to this

1232
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,280
capability

1233
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
we are not at a stage yet where we

1234
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,440
should be drawing hard-line conclusions

1235
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,160
about

1236
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,560
whether this artificial intelligence can

1237
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
be used in various ways

1238
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,040
as part of um armed conflict legally or

1239
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
unlawfully

1240
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,640
but there we need to develop this

1241
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,839
further um

1242
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,720
before we make these these calls so you

1243
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,400
know i would agree with that

1244
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
um in contrast to the great

1245
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,319
presentations

1246
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,040
um you know max we we've worked together

1247
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,240
for some years now

1248
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,160
uh i want to congratulate him for all

1249
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,520
his work at scicon

1250
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,680
and and in the international law of

1251
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,280
cyber operations course

1252
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,520
but he said he's he's a very balanced

1253
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,839
individual balance matters to him very

1254
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:38,240
much

1255
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,599
and so he said i need somebody

1256
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,079
to regress the overall quality of the

1257
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
presentation to the mean and so he

1258
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,440
invited me

1259
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,839
to come and speak in contrast to the

1260
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,240
great presentations you've seen so far

1261
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,440
um and so i i don't have a paper

1262
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,720
that i wrote for this this presentation

1263
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,839
nor and quite surprisingly as a us army

1264
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,480
officer

1265
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,000
recently retired i don't have a

1266
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,319
powerpoint presentation so

1267
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,520
i hope you'll forgive me for the

1268
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,160
transgression um as i talk

1269
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,920
take a few minutes and just kind of

1270
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,520
offer um

1271
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,280
i wouldn't say completely different i'd

1272
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,560
say slightly different on

1273
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,280
on certain levels um perspective on some

1274
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,400
of these things

1275
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,280
but but also i hear resonance in both

1276
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,480
presentation with

1277
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,160
with some of the thoughts that i've i've

1278
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,280
got about this um

1279
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,000
so you know it's great to be here i wish

1280
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,640
i was

1281
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,560
it was not virtual i wish i was in town

1282
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,079
instead i'm stuck with the

1283
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,880
very disconcerting and eerie hum of the

1284
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,280
17-year cicada invasion in the

1285
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,720
washington area right now

1286
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
if any of you are tracking that but here

1287
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,400
we are

1288
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,839
at scicon uh you know probably the most

1289
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,560
important forum for discussing

1290
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,520
the the aspects and implications of

1291
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,280
cyber conflict

1292
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,119
and the theme going viral you know is

1293
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,319
interesting i think if you were to go

1294
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,599
back and look

1295
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,720
at scicon from the beginning and i found

1296
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
this as i've tracked sort of certainly

1297
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,599
cyber

1298
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,440
operations um in in my career

1299
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,599
you'd see that it was far more a

1300
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,119
discussion of the

1301
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,319
the theoretical the hypothetical at the

1302
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,160
beginning

1303
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,720
whereas now cyber operations truly have

1304
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,680
gone viral

1305
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,599
right there's viral aspects to them but

1306
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,200
they've gone viral

1307
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
and just since december

1308
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,599
we're wrestling with solar winds we're

1309
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,359
wrestling with the microstate soft

1310
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,960
exchange server

1311
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,760
event we are you know attribution is

1312
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
still sort of out there right now but

1313
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,559
we just um you know i couldn't fill up

1314
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,599
my my gas tank for several

1315
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,800
days to a week because of the the hack

1316
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,040
into the colonial pipeline

1317
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,359
uh you know system in the united states

1318
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,720
and i saw at least one

1319
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,000
reporter statistic that no less than 10

1320
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
major cyber events in the first quarter

1321
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,760
of 2021 right it's just happening at a

1322
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,200
in a scale level

1323
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,640
um and and this is not abating it it's

1324
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,160
only getting

1325
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,599
worse at a certain level um

1326
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,280
and so with this accelerating problem

1327
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,839
and and not withstanding the

1328
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,960
increasingly

1329
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,960
robust dialogue that we've had over the

1330
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,040
years we've had two talent manuals we've

1331
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,839
had

1332
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,040
the gge process the open-ended working

1333
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,839
group we have an increasing number of

1334
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,000
states

1335
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,319
making official pronouncements um sort

1336
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,040
of

1337
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,400
bringing some greater clarity to the

1338
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,960
the ambiguous of space of international

1339
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,240
law and cyber

1340
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,880
um that that just hasn't slowed

1341
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,640
unfortunately

1342
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,079
what's been happening right so states

1343
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,680
have obviously figured out that cyber

1344
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,359
capabilities and operations

1345
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,079
are a lucrative tool in their state

1346
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,000
craft kit bag

1347
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,160
and some are using that tool far more

1348
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
aggressively than others

1349
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,520
and recklessly um but that's like i said

1350
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,960
unlikely to change

1351
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,359
anytime soon and so sort of with that is

1352
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,680
some background context

1353
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,480
what i'd like to offer as max said is a

1354
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,240
couple of cautionary notes

1355
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,160
along four maybe overlapping lines but

1356
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,520
um you know one is a note of caution on

1357
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,640
expecting too much from the law

1358
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
and the work it can do and should do

1359
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,240
when thinking about how to address the

1360
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,839
reality of cyber

1361
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,960
threats and conflict

1362
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,280
a second is a note of caution about the

1363
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,839
challenge and limits of applying law

1364
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,400
by analogy or translation right to the

1365
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,160
point of the article you referenced max

1366
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,040
a third is caution about the real risks

1367
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,200
at times of overextending specific

1368
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,720
bodies or rules

1369
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,240
of international law beyond their

1370
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,640
intended scope or application

1371
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,680
and as i'll talk about sometimes that

1372
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,160
brings in inherent risk itself at other

1373
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,040
times

1374
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,160
that uh might be overly constraining uh

1375
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,720
in the

1376
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,839
in the face of dealing with these

1377
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,160
threats

1378
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,680
and then over precipitous and broad

1379
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,800
regulation can come with opportunity

1380
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,640
cost i think this is part of

1381
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,440
the first presentation um right there

1382
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,160
there could be

1383
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,200
humanitarian benefits to ai

1384
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,599
as was brought out in that discussion

1385
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,480
there uh

1386
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,240
you know i wrote a piece for the icrc

1387
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,160
blog a few years ago there

1388
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,400
there are some very real humanitarian

1389
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,440
compliant

1390
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
uses of cyber operations and

1391
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,920
capabilities and so issuing them

1392
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,599
outright or over

1393
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,760
or overstating that um has an

1394
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,960
opportunity

1395
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,240
cost to as well um i'm going to try and

1396
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,839
preserve as much time for questions as

1397
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,680
possible because i know we're running

1398
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,520
toward the end of this but let me just

1399
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,760
say too that i'm not arguing against

1400
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,920
international law i'm a firm believer in

1401
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,520
the importance of international law

1402
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,640
i i've worked with it i've applied it i

1403
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
teach it

1404
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,040
i write about it i've made arguments for

1405
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,559
good faith extension of certain

1406
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,680
international law

1407
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,800
principles um sort of in for example in

1408
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,920
the area of

1409
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,040
regulating uh state strategic deception

1410
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,839
activities um you know a growing and

1411
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,079
acute problem that we see right now

1412
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,880
the rules-based international order is

1413
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
you know fundamental and has been for

1414
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,440
the last

1415
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,640
80 years but we also have to

1416
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,040
understand as i said that

1417
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,160
i also come at this and without opening

1418
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,880
the debate

1419
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
stage for the question of the role of

1420
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
sovereignty in cyberspace

1421
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,400
um a quintessential act of of sovereign

1422
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,200
prerogative

1423
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,880
is states lawmaking function

1424
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,720
right the question of international law

1425
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,559
is reserved to state states

1426
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,480
make it and it's up to states to evolve

1427
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,400
it um and

1428
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
uh you know it at risk of borrowing too

1429
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,079
much from a phrase often used in our own

1430
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,920
internal constitutional debates in the

1431
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,280
united states

1432
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
you know international law is not a

1433
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,640
suicide pact

1434
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,319
it has to be practical and functional

1435
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,200
um in responding to uh the the threats

1436
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,720
out there that we face

1437
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,680
so you know real quickly and we can take

1438
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,160
this

1439
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,480
on into questions but let's just take

1440
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,240
the first point of expecting too much

1441
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,920
from the law

1442
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,920
uh one i've seen at a macro level

1443
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,480
you know international law as a

1444
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
deterrent

1445
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,119
force there's some truth to that

1446
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,319
but i think that that gets overstated

1447
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,040
compliant states are compliant not

1448
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,880
because of fear of retribution but

1449
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,559
because they're generally law abiding

1450
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,760
states

1451
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,520
and the states that are non-compliant

1452
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,359
are non-compliant because

1453
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,640
they're not concerned about consequences

1454
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,960
of violating international law and so

1455
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,160
absent

1456
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,240
sort of cost mechanisms and compliance

1457
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,000
mechanisms

1458
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,160
international law is is certainly

1459
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,119
weakened

1460
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,960
and unfortunately the way the system has

1461
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,839
evolved since 1949

1462
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,720
it is very much dependent on sort of

1463
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,079
self-help remedies

1464
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,119
in the structure and a commitment so

1465
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,720
to sort of backing and implementing

1466
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,640
these rules so i take a look at for

1467
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,200
example

1468
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,319
russia one can argue as

1469
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,480
monica indicated most activity is

1470
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,440
happening below

1471
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,920
or outside of armed conflict below the

1472
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,440
threshold of a use of force in

1473
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,119
international law

1474
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,280
isn't that indication that it's having a

1475
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,119
deterrent effect

1476
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,440
um i i don't think so i think that

1477
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,559
that's uh you know

1478
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,040
states like russia who are the primary

1479
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,960
threat actors

1480
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,240
see that as the equivalent of a red line

1481
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,480
that they don't want to cross not that

1482
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,280
they're

1483
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,760
compliant with law or concern with the

1484
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,760
legal implications of what they're doing

1485
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,000
and the not-patchy operation is a is a

1486
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,640
prime example of that

1487
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,599
you can touch on that in a second so i

1488
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,440
do think it has a tempering effect but

1489
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,000
it has

1490
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,720
limitations at the micro level we can

1491
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,839
talk i i also

1492
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,040
take the article 36 discussion a lot but

1493
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,359
to unpack there but i don't know that it

1494
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,000
can do

1495
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
the full extent of work um that

1496
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,119
that was you know part of both

1497
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,880
presentations and in this

1498
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,960
circumstance i think it has a far more

1499
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
limited scope of what it is intended to

1500
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,599
do

1501
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,720
and we certainly know that um states

1502
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,599
observe it more there's a a small number

1503
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,799
of states that actually go through

1504
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,160
article 36

1505
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
review processes notwithstanding the

1506
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,760
number of states that are legally bought

1507
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,760
by bound to under article 36 itself

1508
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,440
um the translation point and the caution

1509
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,880
there

1510
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,440
yes i think uh that that international

1511
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,720
law is adaptable

1512
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,280
it's made to be adaptable certainly the

1513
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
law of armed conflict

1514
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,640
but there are times where there are

1515
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,319
limits to that um

1516
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,319
and then sort of over-extension of these

1517
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,480
principles

1518
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,799
can have constraining effect i've seen

1519
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,559
this for example

1520
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,079
in efforts to try and transport

1521
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,880
collateral damage estimate processes and

1522
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,799
methodologies

1523
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,599
from armed conflict sort of planning

1524
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,799
scenarios into non-armed conflict

1525
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,119
and it's just sort of inapt within armed

1526
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:27,839
conflict

1527
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,680
the proportionality rule is set and

1528
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,040
defined by law

1529
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,880
and that's the baseline of a collateral

1530
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,119
damage estimate process

1531
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,359
outside of armed conflict and even in

1532
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,720
armed conflict for

1533
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,720
a number of different operations with

1534
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,640
cyber effects that don't reach

1535
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,000
the article 49 threshold it's a matter

1536
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,880
of

1537
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,839
policy and command intent that drives

1538
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,599
what limitations should be in place

1539
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,200
um and so sometimes overextending

1540
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,880
can be a problem and then you know just

1541
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,680
for time's sake i'll say

1542
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,400
i i do have some concern the the dod law

1543
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,799
of

1544
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,359
war policy has tried to address the the

1545
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,119
sort of law void or gap

1546
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,119
question for years in a policy that

1547
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,480
extended

1548
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,799
um the law of war adherence to the law

1549
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,680
of war to

1550
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,040
all operations right any um

1551
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,520
conflicts however however characterized

1552
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,960
and beyond

1553
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,680
that also raises difficult concerns and

1554
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,799
questions about

1555
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,960
transporting the concepts of military

1556
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,480
necessity

1557
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,240
and the related uh rule of military

1558
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,040
objective

1559
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,920
into non-armed conflict scenarios where

1560
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,640
it has

1561
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,240
no place the extraordinary

1562
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,119
circumstance of being able to target for

1563
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,599
lethal effect or destructive effect

1564
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,799
certain things um is very much limited

1565
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:49,359
to the lex

1566
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,359
specialist circumstance of the law of

1567
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,359
armed conflict and should not be brought

1568
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,319
over

1569
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,520
too too quickly into into areas where

1570
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,599
it doesn't apply there's a lot more i

1571
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,880
could tease out there

1572
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,200
um on all of these times running short

1573
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,440
we have two minutes or so so i will stop

1574
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,000
there

1575
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,520
max and and leave it for questions

1576
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,799
wonderful thank you very much uh gary uh

1577
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,839
before we if you mean three minutes left

1578
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,359
for question about we received on the

1579
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,400
chat one question

1580
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,920
uh for monica uh or not peter

1581
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,839
or not petya there were some check

1582
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,119
against certain

1583
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,240
endpoint detection systems meaning it

1584
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:28,960
did not

1585
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,520
launch its payload in any environment so

1586
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,480
the question is

1587
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,440
there was was this a form of restraint

1588
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,040
i mean i don't think anyone could really

1589
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,880
claim that not petcha was in any way

1590
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,319
restrained right

1591
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,040
um it spread globally affected companies

1592
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,440
which

1593
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,240
surely were outside of its its target

1594
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,200
systems

1595
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,760
um so i think even if there were certain

1596
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,480
um

1597
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,319
additional measures put in place it

1598
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,839
definitely was you know

1599
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,160
it's widely regarded as one of the most

1600
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,000
indiscriminate cyber operations today

1601
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,359
