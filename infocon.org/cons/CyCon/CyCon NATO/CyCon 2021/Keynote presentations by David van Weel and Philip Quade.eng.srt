with two keynotes one from nato

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,800
assistant secretary general

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,600
for emerging security challenges david

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,719
vanvale

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960

philip great as yesterday please share

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,159
your thoughts and ideas

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,159
also on social media by using the

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,119
hashtag psychon2021

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
i hardly think that nato assistant

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
secretary general for emerging security

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,200
challenges

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
mr davenport real needs much

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
introduction so without further ado

[Music]

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
thank you hendrick and ladies and

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
gentlemen good afternoon it's a pleasure

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,799
joining you today

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,159
and i'm very happy to be able to

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,720
continue the legacy of representing nato

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,280
cyber at this prestigious event

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
my thanks go to the center of excellence

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,520
as ever for organizing this event and

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
for the diligence in keeping this

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
important platform going

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
over all these years 2021 is a watershed

46
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,680
year for cyber and in more ways than one

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
first we witness a growing diversity of

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
risks and incidents

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
second we can observe a growing

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,080
diversity in the strategic context of

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
cyber

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
and third as a consequence we are seeing

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
a growing diversity

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
of nato's responses to cyber challenges

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
let me address each of these

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
developments in turn

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
first the risks and incidents here we

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
can observe that threat actors are

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
consistently broadening the range of

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
tools

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
for challenging the alliance in

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
cyberspace i offer three examples

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
one example is ransomware ransomware

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
used to be

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
associated with seeking economic

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
benefits and it was never seen as a

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
major political factor

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
however ransomware attacks have now

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
become so severe

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
that the uk and csc and others have

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
started to issue regular warnings

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
about this formal threat the attack by

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
the dark side group against colonial

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
pipeline in the u.s

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
was a very recent reminder of the

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
growing significance

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
of ransomware attacks and since colonial

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
pipelines supplied almost half

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
of the fuel for the us east coast the

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
attacks disrupted that supply and led to

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,159
considerable increase

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,599
in gas prices as a result airlines had

83
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,080
to reschedule their flights to bunker

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
and the biden administration relaxed

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
some regulatory conditions

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
regarding the quality of patrol to

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
ensure

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
continuity of supply to the pumps

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
what is interesting from our perspective

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
is a statement put out by darkside

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
ransomware group

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
the group that was designated by the us

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
as being responsible

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
perhaps feeling some kind of retaliation

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,000
or consequences

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
they issued a statement saying that they

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
were not they were only in it for the

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,319
money

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
and not politically motivated whether

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,879
this is any consolation i leave for you

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
to judge

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
another example of the broadening of the

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
toolbox of hybrid aggressors

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,439
is influence operations these two are on

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,159
the rise

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,080
and we witness more and more cases of

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
information being corrupted

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
or modified in order to influence

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
populations or decision makers

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
often with the help of social media

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
one recent example was the targeting of

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
polish government websites and official

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599
social media accounts

114
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,760
the aim of attackers was to spread false

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
information

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,959
most likely in order to stir up unrest

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
about plans

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,759
for poland's nuclear power program

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
finally we see an uptick in

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
cyber-enabled espionage

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
as exemplified by the solarwinds case at

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,919
the turn of the year

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
that case was interesting because it

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
compromised the company which

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
represented a highly lucrative target

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
as a jumping off point for the

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
perpetrators to then access a wealth of

128
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
downstream users

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
some likened this attack to a kind of

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,880
cyber intelligence preparation of the

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
battlefield

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
there's a saying that one should never

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
let a good crisis go to waste

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
and that's why we need to ask ourselves

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
the question whether these incidents are

136
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
leading us to adapt our defenses

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
accordingly

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
in fact we are seeing this play out in

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
real time as the bind administration and

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
u.s congress

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
are determined to rapidly review the

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,560
lessons of solar winds

143
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,919
and colonial pipeline clearly the us is

144
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
regarding these attacks as a wake-up

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
call

146
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
it should be for all of us we need to be

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
even more vigilant than before

148
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
the second major change is the growing

149
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
dynamism of the strategic context in

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
which these threats occur

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
many nations are becoming more muscular

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
and overt about their approaches and

153
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
tolerance to cyber risks

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
there's also a growing perception that

155
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
cyber deterrence may not be the best way

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
to look at the issue

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
for example the 2018 u.s cyber defense

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,199
strategy

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
tones down the deterrence notion and

160
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
instead uses terminology like

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
persistent engagement for a long time

162
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,400
the dominant narrative was that

163
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
cyberspace should be treated

164
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,479
just like any other domains like air

165
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
land and sea

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
not anymore the pendulum is beginning to

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
swing

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,039
cyberspace is unique and hence we need

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,680
to find

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,960
a better conceptualization using

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,800
insufficient analogies from nuclear

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,520
deterrence theory or special operations

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
will not help decision makers rather it

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
will mislead them

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
the notion of cyber deterrence may sound

176
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
reassuring yet the more we learn about

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
cyberspace

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
the less compelling it appears to draw

179
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
parallels between the cyber and nuclear

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
domains

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
and in a similar vein we need to revisit

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
the notion of thresholds

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
a good example cyber attribution

184
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
for quite some time we have put our

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
hopes in the belief that aggressors

186
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
don't want to be called out

187
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,560
hence the mere risk of being named and

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
shamed would deter them from committing

189
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
certain malign actions

190
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,199
it doesn't appear so we see an

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
increasing number of statements which

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
call out unacceptable behavior in

193
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
cyberspace

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
yet this drawing of new red lines

195
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,919
doesn't seem to have much of a deterrent

196
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,960
effect

197
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
on the contrary we see old thresholds

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
being crossed

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
now the good news is that many stricken

200
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,880
nations seem increasingly willing to

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,759
strike back

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,599
with a set of tools that's broader than

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
merely attribution

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
but the fact of the matter is that the

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,199
goal posts are moving

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
the rubicon that you just won across is

207
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
no more

208
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,720
clearly the role of cyber on the

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
geopolitical stage

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
continues to grow one indication is a

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
discussion on supply chain risk

212
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
be it through solar winds late last year

213
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,759
or the ongoing discussion about trust

214
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,280
and third-party vendors

215
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
that surfaced during the debate over the

216
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
transition to 5g

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
we also see the private sector flexing

218
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
it

219
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,360
its muscles acting in some respects with

220
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,599
quasi-state-like power

221
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
is social media companies silencing

222
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
elected officials a good thing

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
is it ethical is it even a role of the

224
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,080
private company to de-platform somebody

225
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
finally there's also an increasing

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,919
recognition of the nature of the

227
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,199
persistent struggle

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,720
between offense and defense simply put

229
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
the assumption that in cyberspace the

230
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,879
defense is always one step behind

231
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
might not hold forever shifting to a

232
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,879
proactive approach

233
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
as some allies have done may be

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
indication of this change

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
in any case there is no law of nature

236
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
that would condemn the defensive

237
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
to always lose out my third and final

238
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,400
point

239
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
is the need to have a broad range of

240
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
responses

241
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
just as the threat landscape is

242
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
diversifying

243
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
so must our cyber toolbox as many of you

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,599
will be aware

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,760
allies are presently in the midst of

246
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
negotiating

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,440
a new nato cyber defense policy due to

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
be agreed later this summer

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
it represents a major update of our

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
previous policy which was agreed in 2014

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
at the will summit

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,360
the 2014 policy was in itself quite

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,959
significant

254
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,640
it brought cyber defense under the

255
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
umbrella of collective defense

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
the famous article 5 and it affirmed the

257
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
applicability of

258
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
international humanitarian law to

259
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
cyberspace

260
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
since then we've consistently broadened

261
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
our cyber toolbox

262
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
in 2016 at the warsaw summit allies

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
committed to the cyber defense pledge

264
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
to strengthen the cyber defenses of

265
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,160
national infrastructures and networks

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
and to do so as a matter of priority

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
allies also agreed to recognize

268
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,519
cyberspace as a domain of operations

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
just as air land and sea associated with

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
this we also

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
adopted the nato command structure to

272
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,480
bring online a new cyberspace operations

273
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,839
center the syog

274
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
and we created a unique platform the

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,519
so-called kepha

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
the mouthful of sovereign cyber effects

277
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,399
provided voluntarily by allies

278
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
which allows allies to volunteer their

279
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
national offensive cyber capabilities

280
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
into alliance operations and missions

281
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
looking at the question of critical

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
infrastructure so-called nato's baseline

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
requirements for national resilience

284
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,160
were updated in 2019 and 2020

285
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
to take into account the challenge from

286
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
5g foreign direct investments

287
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
and the implications of the covert

288
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
pandemic

289
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
these non-binding guidelines represent

290
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,519
the canon

291
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
of good practice for allies to help them

292
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
build national resilience

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
because we understand that nato's

294
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
collective performance as a defense

295
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,680
alliance

296
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
ultimately depends upon the national

297
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,880
resilience of each

298
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
ally a similar logic applies to nato's

299
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
dependence on national supply chains

300
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
nato's own infrastructure is relatively

301
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
small which makes it crucially important

302
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,480
for us

303
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
to review our own measures for

304
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
addressing supply chain risks

305
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
this particularly true for those

306
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,160
technologies

307
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,360
that underpin nato's own ict footprint

308
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
and our operations and missions

309
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,839
finally let me return to the bigger

310
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,160
pitch

311
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
in 2019 allies agreed a nato guide for

312
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,959
strategic response options

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,320
to malicious cyber activities this guide

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,360
or toolbox

315
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,839
sets out a range of measures that allies

316
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,839
and nato can take to respond to cyber

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,560
threats

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,600
below the threshold of an armed attack

319
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
amongst the elements it lists diplomatic

320
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
or political statements

321
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
economic sanctions that allies may wish

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,079
to agree and implement

323
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
within the sovereign right the explosion

324
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
of officials

325
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,519
the sharing of information and of course

326
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
attribution

327
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
the guide reinforces the importance of

328
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,399
nato as an important venue for exchange

329
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
of information

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
and as a means to signal unity and

331
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
solidarity for example in the case of

332
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,320
collector

333
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
attribution in sum our cyber toolbox is

334
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
broadening

335
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
in line with the diversifying threat

336
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
landscape and we must do everything to

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
maintain the momentum

338
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,240
in our cyber agenda so what's next

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
a few pointers first the upcoming summit

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,839
will place an understandable emphasis

341
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,120
upon resilience

342
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
as part of the nato 2030 agenda

343
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
as has become obvious during the

344
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,480
pandemic there is something of a perfect

345
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
storm

346
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
approaching with regards to cyber supply

347
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,639
chain issues

348
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
our societies are more and more reliant

349
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,959
upon resilient infrastructures

350
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,560
frequently underpinned by cyber

351
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
technologies

352
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,399
but these infrastructures are subject to

353
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,720
risk stemming from a complex economic

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
and industrial landscape

355
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
these risks force us to adopt and to

356
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,959
implement

357
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,040
more sophisticated approaches to

358
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
resilience

359
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
in keeping our society safe and secure

360
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,880
there are no easy fixes

361
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
second we need to better align strategy

362
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
with the strategic environment

363
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
given the diversifying threat landscape

364
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,880
i described earlier

365
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
this should be a no-brainer yet all too

366
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
often i find that there's too little

367
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
thought given to this

368
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,000
in particular we will need to fully

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
acknowledge

370
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
that the real security implications of

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
the expectation of cyberspace

372
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
do not come from a single big bang but

373
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
for the accumulating effect

374
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
of risk salami slicing away at our

375
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
defense

376
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
in other words those who want to harm us

377
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
can achieve the same strategic gains

378
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
below the threshold of of our response

379
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
and this means that allies will need to

380
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
be ready and comfortable with using all

381
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
the all the tools in the toolbox

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
to manage escalation risk

383
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,959
clearly rolling with the punches seems

384
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,560
to no longer be an effective way of

385
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,320
dealing with aggression in cyberspace

386
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
third we must make an even greater

387
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
effort to use nato as a unifying

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
platform

389
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
this pertains in particular to the

390
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
discussion on tech standards

391
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,639
where innovation has implications for

392
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
cyber

393
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,920
the current debate on artificial

394
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
intelligence is such a case

395
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
but nato's unifying role can also be

396
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
extended to the ongoing debate

397
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,279
on cyber norms and the application of

398
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
international humanitarian law

399
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,480
in all of these areas we should use nato

400
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
to help us devise

401
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
a collective response to our challenges

402
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,320
in the international system

403
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,639
we must not allow those revisionist

404
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
powers to destroy this system

405
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
then finally in responding to new

406
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,279
security challenges

407
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
we are also rapidly progressing on our

408
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
work on emerging and disruptive

409
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
technologies

410
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
our artificial intelligence strategy

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
will be published shortly

412
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
and we are also working on a policy to

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
help nato make the most of the vast

414
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,079
volumes of data

415
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
while data and ai are inextricably

416
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,519
linked

417
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
cyber defense is no doubt going to be

418
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
one of the key areas

419
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,160
in which they will apply ladies and

420
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,720
gentlemen

421
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
let me close by noting that cyberspace

422
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,560
doesn't stand still

423
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
and similarly if we are to keep our

424
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
promise of protecting our populations

425
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,519
neither can nato we have to be able to

426
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,320
adapt

427
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
to the changing trends of disruption and

428
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,480
expectation of cyberspace

429
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
to the changing thinking and

430
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
conceptualization of responses

431
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
and to our evolved understanding of the

432
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
tasks and priorities for nato

433
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,839
in defending cyberspace looking at the

434
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,839
evolution of nato cyber defence policy

435
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,720
and toolbox

436
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
i can confidently say that this

437
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
adaptation will succeed

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
thank you for attention and i wish you a

439
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,839
great conference

440
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,379
[Music]

441
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,199
thank you mr van vel for your insightful

442
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:49,759
speech

443
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
highlighting the emerging threats new

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,759
trends in state behavior

445
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,759
at the nato perspective and of course

446
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,800
for highlighting

447
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
the applicability of international law

448
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
to cyberspace

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,880
i am sure this was as eye-opening for

450
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,360
the audience as it was for us

451
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
this now brings us to our next keynote

452
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279

floor to you

462
00:16:41,690 --> 00:17:55,119
[Music]

463
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
hi everybody my name is phil quade and i

464
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
appreciate the opportunity to have some

465
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
time to spend

466
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
today talk about uh to talk about nato

467
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
uh the world's changed quite a bit

468
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
in the 70 plus years since nato has been

469
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
established and one thing is

470
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
we can be certain of is that 20 the

471
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
decade of 2020 will be no exception

472
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
uh in the in the 30 plus years or so i

473
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
worked at the national security agency

474
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
the white house and

475
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,559
uh with nato and many other uh important

476
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,600
allies

477
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,640
uh and now as five years as c cells one

478
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
of the largest and most integrated cyber

479
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
security companies

480
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,440
one of the things i've learned is that

481
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,120
some things haven't changed

482
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,080
and that's the importance of strategy

483
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,960
planning

484
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,240
capabilities and people so what i'd like

485
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
to do

486
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
is share some of the challenges and

487
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
opportunities ahead of us

488
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
as nato plans cyber policy for the

489
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,840
decade ahead

490
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
and importantly as nato plans itm i.t

491
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
modernization for the decade ahead

492
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
because policy that's disconnected from

493
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,840
strategy and capabilities in people

494
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,559
just won't be realized so uh if i could

495
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,679
i'd like to share some

496
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
visuals to complement some of the words

497
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
that i plan to use

498
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
and let's go ahead and start stepping

499
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,679
through some of those things

500
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,240
so i start with a lofty title of the

501
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,200
capitalism

502
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,960
of cyber security and the message behind

503
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
these words on the chart is that the

504
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
private sector has come a

505
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
long way towards um providing some of

506
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,520
the high-end capabilities

507
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
that our countries need to do collect to

508
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,559
defend

509
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
support collective offense in support of

510
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
our our

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
our democratic mission and um we're

512
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,000
going to jump to that

513
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
a little bit later on specifically what

514
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,200
i mean about the

515
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
the capitalism aspect but what i'd first

516
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
like to do is

517
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
take a look at some of the technology

518
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
aspect of things and look at

519
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
future architectures

520
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,760
so today or historically

521
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
we had cyber security architectures of

522
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
consists of

523
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
computers and servers and things like

524
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
that and i call that the core

525
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
and we quickly realized that we could

526
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
come more efficient in how we use those

527
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,039
computers

528
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,480
if we virtualize some of those

529
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,919
capabilities so they could be used by

530
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,039
many people

531
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
and the the the percentage use would be

532
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,919
greatly increased be a much more

533
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,320
efficient process but throughout we

534
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,200
always had

535
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,760
the uh the issue of how do you get

536
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
people to be able to connect to those

537
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,679
uh assets whether they are in your core

538
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
or in your cloud and we call that

539
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
endpoint

540
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
now the endpoint has changed quite a bit

541
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
over the years right it was

542
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,960
uh first the end point was uh

543
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
desktops and and evolve later on we're

544
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,159
going to talk a little bit more about

545
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,760
the importance of that

546
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,480
but the uh the the important thing from

547
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
a strategy perspective

548
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
is not whether you had good endpoint

549
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,760
security or good cloud security or good

550
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,520
uh core security it's the best strategy

551
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
and the best capabilities are the ones

552
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
that integrated your defense across all

553
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
three of those aspects of your

554
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
architecture because

555
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
you don't want your adversary to pick

556
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,840
the time and place of their choosing

557
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
to exploit your network by having an

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
integrated defense across the endpoint

559
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,280
the core in the cloud

560
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
you could defend at the time and place

561
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,559
of your strength and weakness and of

562
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,280
your choosing

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
ideally so the best architectures

564
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
had integrated defense across all

565
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
aspects of the architecture

566
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,120
and it had threat intelligence right uh

567
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
substantial research informing each of

568
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
those capabilities no matter where they

569
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,919
exist

570
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
on what the threat is at any given

571
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
moment and sending out proposed

572
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
mitigations to those threats so

573
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
this is pretty good stuff this type of

574
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
architecture integrated defense

575
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
informed by uh informed by threat

576
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
intelligence

577
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
now what's changed though is uh the end

578
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,880
point

579
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,159
the the endpoint used to be

580
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
characterized solely as desktop

581
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
computers and laptop computers maybe

582
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,159
tablets and of course uh

583
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,799
smartphones but what's about to change

584
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
drastically is

585
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,799
as uh the endpoints going to explode now

586
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,600
i call this

587
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
um this phenomenon sci-fi it's the

588
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
uh the integration of the cyber

589
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
environment what you traditionally see

590
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
on the right-hand side of these charts

591
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
with the physical environment and so

592
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
let's take a little bit closer look what

593
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,360
that physical environment is going to

594
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,000
look like

595
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,039
so historically the the instrumentation

596
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
of the physical domain

597
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
is mostly characterized by something we

598
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,559
all call operational technology right

599
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
our critical infrastructures

600
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
for many many decades have used sensors

601
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
and actuators and other in

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
other analytic tools to ensure that

603
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
these physical oriented devices whether

604
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
they be in our

605
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,480
uh moving electricity or in our smart

606
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,400
factories

607
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,520
are doing the right thing for the

608
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,760
purposes of safety and reliability

609
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,960
but i think as we all know the the

610
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
physical domain is going to get a whole

611
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,919
lot more interesting

612
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,520
primarily with the explosion of the use

613
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
of the internet of things devices right

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
iot devices are going to rapidly

615
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
instrument our

616
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
physical domain and that could be our

617
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,400
offices our cars

618
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,679
our cities and even our bodies

619
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
there'll be sensors everywhere and as

620
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
we'll talk about later on

621
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
they'll be both great opportunities and

622
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
great challenges as we instrument that

623
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
physical domain

624
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
and lastly as i've alluded to it all our

625
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,159
buildings whether they're

626
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,720
our simple old office buildings or our

627
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
highest tech

628
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
um smart factories are are going to be

629
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,440
heavily instrumented

630
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
so i call that the uh the the

631
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
instrumentation of the physical domain

632
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,320
and a lot of data is going to be

633
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
generated in that domain

634
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
and that's going to be greatly enabled

635
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
by fast ubiquitous communications out

636
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,799
there in that physical domain

637
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
so you can move information back and

638
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,120
forth in that physical domain any that

639
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
information

640
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,080
might not ever traverse the traditional

641
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
cyber domain that we

642
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
have illustrated on the right

643
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
the story doesn't quite end there

644
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
because here's the real opportunity

645
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,559
um why don't we take data that's

646
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
generated in that physical domain

647
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
and richly intermingle it responsibly

648
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
with data and insights we generate in

649
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
the cyber domain so that's the true

650
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
sci-fi vision taking advantage of the

651
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
insights we can get from the the i mean

652
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
i'll call the tactical insights we could

653
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,760
get from the physical domain

654
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,799
and combine it with the more contextual

655
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
or maybe strategic insights

656
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,960
we can generate in the cyber domain

657
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,919
where we have

658
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,919
high performance computing in the cloud

659
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,039
big data analytics

660
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
the cloud it's a great opportunity to

661
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,360
take advantage of the sci-fi sci-fi

662
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
convergence now of course with great

663
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,360
opportunity comes great responsibility

664
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
we need to make sure that we

665
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
collectively do this uh with the right

666
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,760
privacy involved

667
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,039
so after all we humans are uh

668
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
elements of the physical domain so

669
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,320
information about

670
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
uh where we're driving what we're doing

671
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
inside or even how fast our heart might

672
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,679
be beating

673
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,000
is you know absolutely deserves the

674
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
highest privacy protections

675
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
similarly data integrity becomes very

676
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
important some of our previous speakers

677
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
correctly talked about information

678
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
poisoning and information and

679
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,720
integrity attacks so data coming from

680
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,919
the physical domain

681
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
has to have the right type of data

682
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
integrity now

683
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
what i've tried to do is just give a

684
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,799
quick glimpse of what i think the future

685
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,000
domain is going to look like in the

686
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
future architectures look like

687
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
but the the heart of my time with you

688
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,279
today um

689
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,279
is not so much on those hard high-tech

690
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
things don't get me wrong i'd love to

691
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
talk more about architecture

692
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,600
and technology and capabilities and i'm

693
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,799
passionate about that

694
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,880
strategy i talked about earlier of

695
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
linking your endpoint

696
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,039
your core in your cloud with integrated

697
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
fast cyber defenses

698
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
but there's one part of the equation in

699
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,320
addition to that that's uh

700
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
too often is overlooked and that's the

701
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,799
people side of the problem

702
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,840
and uh as you might know

703
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
uh in our field the cyber security field

704
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,279
uh there's a huge skills gap right you

705
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,720
can see some of the numbers up on your

706
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,440
screen

707
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,799
uh basically uh the the demand is

708
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,679
far far outstripping the supply and

709
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,120
that's affecting all this whether it's

710
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
small organizations big organizations

711
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,039
government private sector and it's

712
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,240
resulting in

713
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,760
uh unfo unfilled positions it's making

714
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,279
us spend a lot of money searching for

715
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,919
people

716
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,000
and ultimately it's it's not a nameless

717
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,279
to accomplish the mission

718
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
or business objectives at the pace that

719
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,559
we'd like to do

720
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,320
now we my my view on this is that

721
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
we can't just imagine we're going to

722
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,919
suddenly turn out

723
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,240
four million new computer science degree

724
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
people to cover this gap

725
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,440
we need to do indeed uh

726
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,159
invest more in stem education but it's

727
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
not practical think we're going to

728
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
uh churn out that many more computer

729
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
science computer scientists to fill this

730
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,960
gap

731
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
so what we need to do i think is come up

732
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,320
with a

733
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,039
strategy that a little bit more aligned

734
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,279
with what i would call capitalism so

735
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
um you know quick reminder

736
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
how we all got here sorry nato of course

737
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,919
is fundamentally a

738
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,200
a collect a collection of like-minded

739
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
nations that um believe in some core

740
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,799
things

741
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,279
like democracy right like capitalism

742
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,279
and that's what that's what make our

743
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
economic and our government our social

744
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,320
engines roar

745
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,400
uh for many decades behind us and many

746
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
decades ahead

747
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
but there's also a third part of this

748
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
which i'd call social responsibility

749
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,559
it's not quite written in our

750
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,240
constitutions and other

751
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
other uh official documentation but i

752
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
think we all recognize that it's there

753
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,440
that

754
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
um unfettered uh capitalism without some

755
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,320
type of social responsibility

756
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,919
has a lot of speed bumps that we need to

757
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,000
address so what i'd like to do is talk

758
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
today a little bit about

759
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,559
some strategies that that that

760
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,919
you know stay well in tune with our um

761
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,440
our core beliefs of democracy and

762
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,360
capitalism while we go about

763
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,279
solving the cyber security problem and

764
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,480
more specifically

765
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,159
i think we can come up with some idea we

766
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,440
can come up with some strategies and

767
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,080
approaches

768
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
to not only solve the cyber security

769
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,760
problem but create opportunities for

770
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,880
people

771
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
that they just don't that too many young

772
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,080
people and others don't see that they

773
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,200
have today

774
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,880
so let's talk about some more specifics

775
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
so fundamentally what i'm talking about

776
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,679
is applying

777
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,679
the tentative capitalism of balancing

778
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,960
supply and demand

779
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
and i have about uh four or five uh

780
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,000
specific

781
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
ideas i want to talk about uh the first

782
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
one is going to be no surprise right

783
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
from a again i'm from a a very high tech

784
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
well integrated cyber security company

785
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,360
and one of the things that we focus on

786
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
quite a bit at fortinet

787
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
is the integration of our capabilities

788
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
and the automation of our capabilities

789
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
right if you have capabilities at the

790
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
end point up in the cloud

791
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,159
in your core you can't afford to have um

792
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,600
the complexity you can't afford for the

793
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,440
complexity burden of operating

794
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
those capabilities to be so high that

795
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
ultimately start making mistakes

796
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,799
so you really need to rely on the uh

797
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,840
techniques of

798
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,480
automation to decrease the volume that

799
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,279
people have to

800
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,080
that have to personally process and of

801
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,399
course

802
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,799
integration to reduce that complexity so

803
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,080
there's lots of different ways to do

804
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,039
that

805
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
you know you see some of the techniques

806
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,799
you have in my on my screen here

807
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,520
xero trust is indeed it's not just a

808
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,159
buzzword

809
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,000
it is indeed a strategy with

810
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
capabilities behind it i highly

811
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,440
encourage you to pursue

812
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,919
zero trust strategies you see the other

813
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,559
very

814
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,880
valuable viable things on the screen as

815
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,600
well

816
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
but again i'm not here today to give you

817
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,320
a fortinet capabilities brief hopefully

818
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,399
you'll you know spend some more time on

819
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,840
this in another time

820
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,559
but my point here is saying that one of

821
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,640
the five core things we need to do

822
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,960
is decrease the demand on our people by

823
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,159
better leveraging and

824
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,840
automation integration in our cyber

825
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
security strategies

826
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,360
um the next point i have i'd like to

827
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
spend a little bit more time on

828
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,960
which is uh diversity of perspective now

829
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
some of the when you're trying to create

830
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,640
a a

831
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,399
a good team of people you you

832
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,919
you assemble people with some core

833
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,760
competencies right you want to have some

834
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,440
hardcore technologists you want to have

835
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
some soft skill people who are really

836
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,039
good at getting others to work together

837
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,159
you want to have people who are

838
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,000
experienced and of course she needs this

839
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,320
all

840
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,279
um i believe uh informed by strategy

841
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,600
driven by strategy

842
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,919
but along the way you know as you as you

843
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,520
manage larger and larger organizations

844
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,120
and more and more complex operations as

845
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,880
you go over the years

846
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
what you learn though is that diversity

847
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,159
is really really important

848
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,200
i throw a couple examples up here in my

849
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
my days in the national security

850
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,360
community

851
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,039
probably one of the best cyber threat

852
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,799
analyst i ever met wasn't a computer

853
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,080
science degree people

854
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,039
he was an anthropologist and he might

855
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,720
look at me funny for saying that but

856
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,640
but he brought in perspectives that the

857
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,159
rest of us just couldn't imagine he

858
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,039
understood

859
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,520
human evolution he you understood our

860
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,159
instincts

861
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,960
and it helped help he helped us

862
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,159
understand

863
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,720
why certain foreign adversaries or bad

864
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
actors might be acting the way they did

865
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,279
another person who absolutely drove me

866
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,799
crazy at the time

867
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,559
at the beginning until i learned i got

868
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
wiser he was from the cia so

869
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
um i was in charge of um

870
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,519
some computer network attack operations

871
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,120
and my approach was always

872
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,799
if you want to go from a to b you draw a

873
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
state line and go from a to b

874
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,480
well he had different training he was a

875
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
history major and he was trained by the

876
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
cia when before he came to work for me

877
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,480
instead of going from a to b he would go

878
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
from a to c to d to f

879
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
to z and x he'd finally get to b he'd

880
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,559
always get to be and quite honestly the

881
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,919
solution he had

882
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,679
uh was much better than the one i would

883
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,279
have come up with from with my straight

884
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,240
line approach

885
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
my point being is that um it's not about

886
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,080
having

887
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,960
a bunch of uh computer scientists or

888
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
electrical engineers all

889
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
trained in the same way the right

890
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,039
background we really need to have

891
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,320
education diversity

892
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
and to be clear i'm not a computer

893
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
science hater i'm a computer scientist

894
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
myself by education and training

895
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,720
but i've learned that diversity is

896
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
really really important and the highest

897
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,159
performing teams

898
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,320
i ever worked on had all three of these

899
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,360
attributes

900
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,159
um we had some core competencies we had

901
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,679
some education diversity

902
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,159
but importantly we had a diversity of

903
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,279
background

904
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,320
and um uh it included uh

905
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,120
uh both minorities and non-minorities

906
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,440
and

907
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,679
my point being is that when you have

908
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
different perspectives it makes your

909
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,919
your team stronger i even threw a couple

910
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,440
cartoons in here just to drive the point

911
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,080
home

912
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,519
you know if you quickly look at this

913
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,600
diagram you know which person is correct

914
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,080
are there

915
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,799
four or the three items on on on the on

916
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,000
the right hand side

917
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
and similarly with diversity of

918
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
perspective you know it gives you

919
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
better feel for what you're looking at

920
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
are you looking at the broadest most

921
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,919
distance and biggest thing as you can

922
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,720
imagine

923
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
or are you looking about the most

924
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,000
smallest and important things you can

925
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,720
imagine

926
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,799
diversity of perspective will help you

927
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,080
get to the truth

928
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,200
and so that's why i believe that

929
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
diversity is a really really important

930
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,600
part

931
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,480
of solving our cybersecurity skills gap

932
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,279
problem

933
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,120
it'll make us better better operators

934
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,600
and better planners

935
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,880
the third principle i'd like to talk

936
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,720
about to better balance supply and

937
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
demand

938
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,679
is uh quite honestly is looking back

939
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,519
hundreds of years it's borrowing

940
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,679
um an idea from the uh the european

941
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,559
middle ages

942
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,799
and it's the cyber security guild model

943
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,880
um i believe what we need to do

944
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,320
is to uh greatly increase the

945
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
the entry level uh opportunities for

946
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
people into our

947
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,919
our workforce let's bring them in as

948
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,919
apprentices in large numbers

949
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
let's teach them up through training and

950
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,200
education and experiences

951
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
and coach them up and to become

952
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,559
journeymen and some subset of them will

953
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
indeed become masters

954
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
i like this model um not only does it

955
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,200
work for it but it works for the ot

956
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
environment right operational technology

957
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,039
in our critical infrastructures but

958
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,360
importantly it's a it's an enduring

959
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,919
model

960
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,000
right if you if you get this model going

961
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,519
by getting the right number of people

962
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,640
and as apprentices

963
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,399
and you give them opportunities you

964
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,840
indeed are going to have a sustainable

965
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,559
model for the

966
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,519
uh for many many decades to to come so a

967
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,399
guild model

968
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,360
that creates a pipeline of people ought

969
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
to be a big part of our collective

970
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
strategy

971
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,239
this next part is something that um

972
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,000
is i'll call a call to action

973
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,280
too many of us when we sit down to

974
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,639
uh describe a new job that's opening up

975
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
uh one of the first things first things

976
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,599
we write down in the cyber security

977
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,719
community is

978
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,918
uh requires a four-year degree

979
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,079
um well i'd like to challenge that the

980
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,960
next time

981
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,359
you i write a job description let's

982
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,399
think that through do i really need a

983
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,000
four-year degree computer science or

984
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,760
even a four-year degree to do this job

985
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,040
so i can think of just very quickly uh

986
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,119
several roles that don't require such

987
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,560
degrees right

988
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
a role such as a cyber hygienist to keep

989
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,199
our systems patched

990
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,359
with the right frequency folks that work

991
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,639
in operation center

992
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,240
to look for evidence of potential

993
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
incidents and even first responders you

994
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,440
can quickly get to the

995
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,960
scene to help us triage what's going on

996
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
there's you know i just briefly wrote

997
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
these down my point being is that

998
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,200
we need to stop uh correct our instincts

999
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
and not just start every single job

1000
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
description with

1001
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,480
four-year degree required let's give

1002
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
more people opportunity to open our

1003
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,800
field

1004
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
by being more careful for how we write

1005
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,160
our job descriptions

1006
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,760
and bring them in and create that

1007
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,599
pipeline that guild model pipeline

1008
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,839
i talked about a little bit earlier

1009
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,240
and the fifth area that i wanted to talk

1010
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,800
about is of course the importance of

1011
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,440
training right it's you can't just

1012
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,079
simply

1013
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,760
bring in people from different fields

1014
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
and expect them to flourish

1015
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,800
we need to have some type of robust

1016
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,280
and escalating training regime to get

1017
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,960
people to better spots to create these

1018
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
experts than these masters

1019
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
of our domain that we talked about

1020
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,440
earlier earlier today

1021
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,560
my company fortinet um has a uh a

1022
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
very robust training program it was

1023
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
um initially developed for fort netters

1024
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,680
right so four nodes at this point is a

1025
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,520
nine thousand person company a very

1026
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,720
large innovative cyber security company

1027
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,320
um but what we realized is that this

1028
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,560
training we had it was a gold mine

1029
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
and i don't mean in terms of revenue and

1030
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,680
i meant in terms of

1031
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
getting people to a better spot and

1032
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,040
getting more people in our field

1033
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,800
so in the early days of the pandemic

1034
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,400
um fortinet opened up its uh nse

1035
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,599
training program

1036
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,760
uh for free uh at least for the first

1037
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,599
three levels of it

1038
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,560
and um hundreds of thousands of people

1039
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,320
signed up for this training

1040
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,720
and what that told us that there's a

1041
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
great hunger for people to

1042
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
improve themselves try and create more

1043
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,839
opportunities to better their situations

1044
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,520
and they needed to do it at their own

1045
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,280
time and pace and so

1046
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,520
making training available at the at

1047
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
people's uh

1048
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
own time and place um at higher and

1049
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
higher levels of sophistication

1050
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
needs to be a part of our strategy so

1051
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,160
you know so there you have it

1052
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
it those would be my five things to

1053
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
better balance cyber security

1054
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
uh cyber security uh skills gap supply

1055
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,480
and demand

1056
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,520
let's come up with a different

1057
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
definition of diversity and bring in

1058
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
more people into our field

1059
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
let's better leverage automation

1060
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,400
integration to

1061
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
make our jobs less complex and better

1062
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
use people for the things that they're

1063
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,480
getting good at

1064
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
and machines for what they're good at

1065
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
let's create an enduring pipeline model

1066
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,880
so this isn't just a flash in the pan

1067
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,280
solution and let's take some personal

1068
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,400
responsibility

1069
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,640
in defining our job prescriptions so we

1070
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
can bring more people into our field

1071
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
and train them up with the right type of

1072
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,680
uh online training

1073
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,359
and these are these types of things we

1074
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,520
can do to better increase our supply and

1075
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,400
demand

1076
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
so the pitch is let's address this

1077
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,359
skills gap problem like economics right

1078
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,000
it not only solves our cyber security uh

1079
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,599
skills gap problem and our operations

1080
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,400
problem there

1081
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,280
but it's socially responsible as well

1082
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,640
it's going to provide people with

1083
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,440
opportunity

1084
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,880
that they just don't recognize that they

1085
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,720
have today and that

1086
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
that's part of our many many of our

1087
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,079
nations are having some internal

1088
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
conflicts right now where

1089
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,040
too many people don't recognize the

1090
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,440
opportunities that are out there

1091
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,599
um or even that aren't out there so we

1092
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,280
have both an opportunity to

1093
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
simultaneously address the skills got

1094
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
problem in cyber security

1095
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
while giving people more hope for the

1096
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,520
future in providing them with such

1097
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
opportunities

1098
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
i've covered the uh you know the five

1099
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
big uh

1100
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,760
the five big things of how we can

1101
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,400
achieve this

1102
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
better balancing supply and demand and

1103
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
what i'd like to do though is

1104
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,079
is end with a perhaps um maybe more

1105
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,440
less methodical a little bit more

1106
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,800
inspirational way of looking at the

1107
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
problem

1108
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
um today we're using

1109
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,560
cyber security to enable i.t and ot and

1110
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:58,880
even

1111
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,200
physical security to do really important

1112
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,320
things that are

1113
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,520
serving as the engines of our economies

1114
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,359
the engines of our democracies

1115
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,839
and enabling our uh you know the pursuit

1116
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,000
of happiness by our citizens

1117
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,880
whether it be smart factories safe and

1118
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,480
reliable transportation

1119
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
or even better accessible

1120
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,720
healthcare enabled by technology and we

1121
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,000
ought to feel really really good about

1122
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
that

1123
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,240
but if we get even better with the right

1124
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,440
workforce

1125
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,599
um we can do even more important things

1126
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,880
if we integrate

1127
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
the i.t domain with the the cyber domain

1128
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,800
and the physical domain

1129
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
we can uh help solve some really

1130
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,720
important problems whether they be

1131
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,119
mental problems or physical problems we

1132
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,000
can

1133
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,240
continue to address the you know

1134
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,119
thousand years

1135
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,880
thousand years old scourge of world

1136
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,560
hunger by better instrumenting our

1137
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
environment or maybe the transportation

1138
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
systems for distribution food

1139
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,160
and we can address the important issue

1140
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
of climate change

1141
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,880
by having the right instrumentation of

1142
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,560
the environment and having the right

1143
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,240
types of technologies out there

1144
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,960
that can help reduce us all we do um do

1145
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
our part to contribute to the solution

1146
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,760
this problem

1147
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,599
we can do some really really important

1148
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,800
things

1149
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,319
if we master the cyber physical

1150
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,920
integration

1151
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
opportunity and put in the right

1152
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,280
safeguards and

1153
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,359
if we create a workforce that's better

1154
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,560
postured

1155
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
both in numbers in training and

1156
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,599
diversity

1157
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,720
to work in this environment

1158
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,560
so i thank you for your time today uh

1159
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
giving me giving me the opportunity to

1160
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,040
talk a little bit about

1161
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
uh strategy a little bit about

1162
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,240
capabilities

1163
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,760
and hopefully target your heart strings

1164
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
a little bit to say uh not only do we

1165
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,280
have an important mission problem to

1166
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,079
solve right

1167
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,280
getting the right um policy and it it

1168
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
modernization in place for nato to

1169
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
better do its its operational mission

1170
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
but we also have an opportunity and i'll

1171
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,240
say responsibility

1172
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
to help address some of the social needs

1173
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,280
that our nations collectively have

1174
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,359
thank you for your time and if there are

1175
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,400
any questions we can

1176
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,160
we can talk about we can take them now

1177
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,319
[Music]

1178
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,880
thank you mr quaid for sharing your

1179
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,119
ideas a visionary and rather holistic

1180
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,920
approach to

1181
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,280
do all this modernization and

1182
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,599
democratization of cyber security

1183
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,359
and indeed there are some questions from

1184
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
the audience so let's uh let's take a

1185
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,040
couple of them

1186
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
yeah i think the first one that we have

1187
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
from the audience is when you look

1188
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,880
uh from a cyber security trust

1189
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
perspective do you think that cloud

1190
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
computing is applicable to government

1191
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,119
institutions and agencies what are the

1192
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,119
risks and advantages of cloud computing

1193
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:41,920
in terms of

1194
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,680
cyber security yeah

1195
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,400
thank you for the question the uh the

1196
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
good news is that

1197
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,319
cloud security is a great opportunity

1198
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,520
for the government

1199
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,359
of course the private sector as well

1200
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,560
right when uh

1201
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
during the past year we all learned that

1202
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,680
uh

1203
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,040
agility became the foremost principle

1204
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
of the past year that is where we're

1205
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,240
told to be

1206
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,119
do more with less or would be told to do

1207
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,319
more with different

1208
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,680
i mean you know well uh excuse me do

1209
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
do more with less do different with the

1210
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,119
same right do different things for the

1211
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,160
same amount of money

1212
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,680
or on occasion we were given large

1213
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,599
chunks of money and said i recognize

1214
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,960
that cyber security as a business

1215
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,920
enabler

1216
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,560
uh spend this money wisely and so what

1217
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,920
we learned to value is

1218
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
agility right the ability to quickly

1219
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
pivot whether it be operations or other

1220
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,200
capabilities

1221
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,040
and cloud computing allows you to do

1222
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
that if you have some core capabilities

1223
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
that reside physically in your data

1224
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,960
center you can quickly instrument and

1225
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,160
augment

1226
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,440
augment those things with cloud

1227
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,800
computers with capabilities in the cloud

1228
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,880
uh the company my company that i work

1229
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,000
for fortnite

1230
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,079
uh doesn't make governments or users

1231
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,760
choose between

1232
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,319
um on-prem versus cloud that that

1233
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
shouldn't that's a false choice as obama

1234
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,680
used to say right

1235
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,920
um it's both it's not one or the other

1236
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,880
it's both

1237
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,280
so uh the good news is that commercial

1238
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,480
capabilities

1239
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,520
uh fortnets uh allows you to

1240
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,280
have a hybrid environment where you have

1241
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,800
some on-prem

1242
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,880
some in the cloud without increasing

1243
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,079
complexity so

1244
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,800
when it comes to cloud computing i'd say

1245
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,839
go for it

1246
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,960
um it's it it's an important part

1247
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,200
not the entire solution set but it's an

1248
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,800
important part of your solution set

1249
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
and it doesn't have to increase your

1250
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,400
complexity if you do it right

1251
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,599
the second part of the question had to

1252
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,599
do with zero trust zero trust um

1253
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,680
is another one of those words that has

1254
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,839
um

1255
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,240
sustained the hype cycle what i mean

1256
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,520
it's not a hype

1257
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,880
there's actually some there there uh the

1258
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,960
the changing edge which i talked about

1259
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,200
earlier where people want to connect

1260
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,560
any device from anywhere at any time

1261
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,240
to any asset that requires a zero trust

1262
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,440
strategy

1263
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,760
that is you want to ingest or allow a

1264
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,960
device to connect

1265
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,200
but at every point upstream as as it

1266
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,640
moves to different parts your network

1267
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,599
whether it be your core

1268
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,200
or your cloud you want to be able to

1269
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,720
verify devices

1270
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,680
authenticity intent and permissions

1271
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,599
that's what zero trust is all about

1272
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,960
and it's not just a concept it's a very

1273
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,119
very practical thing and the good news

1274
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,920
is that you're probably already doing

1275
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,319
you know

1276
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,560
two or three of the five required steps

1277
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,640
to get to a zero trust environment

1278
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,280
and if you talk to the right people uh

1279
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,240
we can help you

1280
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
get to the fifth step of zero trust and

1281
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,119
allow you to connect all those devices

1282
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,560
and people from anywhere you'd like and

1283
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,359
do so responsibly

1284
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,200
thank you and and actually the next

1285
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,119
question uh carries on pretty much with

1286
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:45,599
uh

1287
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,920
with a similar thought and it asks that

1288
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,800
would you agree that the same zero trust

1289
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,920
is is not to say no trust but rather it

1290
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,760
is layered and aligned with the with the

1291
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,000
critical assets and and process to

1292
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,599
reduce real business risks

1293
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,920
yep it's it's like i say it it does

1294
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,800
indeed it's a responsible thing to do

1295
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,240
as as we appropriately take more risk

1296
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,280
in allowing people on devices to connect

1297
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,400
from different places

1298
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,560
we have to shift our risk taking

1299
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,240
from the edge inside our network that is

1300
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
since some of these devices like iot

1301
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,960
devices are inherently untrustworthy

1302
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
because they they didn't have security

1303
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,200
built in or for whatever reason

1304
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
we don't want to just blindly ingest

1305
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
them into our network allow them connect

1306
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,359
you want to shift your security to other

1307
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,800
parts of your network

1308
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,240
and that's where you have more robust

1309
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,920
security mechanisms built in

1310
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,760
that's what xero trust allows you to do

1311
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,359
importantly that's why that's why i led

1312
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
my talk off by talking about

1313
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,760
the importance of integrated security

1314
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,119
unless you have security that

1315
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,400
collaborates across

1316
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
the edge the core in the cloud you don't

1317
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,240
have a chance at implementing a zero

1318
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,280
trust strategy

1319
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,359
because you can't shift risk and risk

1320
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,200
management to the places of your

1321
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,839
strength

1322
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,040
you're forced to deal with it

1323
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,680
individually it's a bad strategy so

1324
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,079
um yes you can it's important to

1325
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,680
implement zero trust for the reasons

1326
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,960
we've talked about

1327
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,720
but your fundamental strategy is you

1328
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,240
have to have an architecture

1329
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
that's based on that is fully integrated

1330
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
in order to shift and manage that trust

1331
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,839
and integrated more holistic way

1332
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,280
thank you i think we have time for one

1333
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,880
more question um and we have one from

1334
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,480
the audience here

1335
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,599
is the usage of ai just a new technology

1336
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,200
that is used in cyber security

1337
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
or do you see it as a big milestone and

1338
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,920
if yes why

1339
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,119
thanks i'm sure that question's been

1340
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,079
asked before and i hope you're not

1341
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,960
repeating

1342
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,160
anyone um ai is both evolutionary

1343
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,200
and revolutionary and um it's it's

1344
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,440
evolutionary in

1345
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,200
in the fact that machine learning is

1346
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,040
here today my company's been

1347
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,839
using machine learning for at least five

1348
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,400
years

1349
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,079
to look at billions and billions of

1350
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,520
pieces of information

1351
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,960
that we characterize into threat

1352
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,880
intelligence so machine learning the

1353
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,040
machine learning aspect of ai's here

1354
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,240
today

1355
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,160
um full ai of course is not here today

1356
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
excuse me i don't want lightning bolt to

1357
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,359
hit me for saying that

1358
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,839
um there's lots of different definitions

1359
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,040
of ai

1360
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,160
um the fullest vision of ai

1361
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,839
won't be realized until we have

1362
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,280
connected architectures

1363
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,440
that allow you to do compute some

1364
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
context perhaps in your cloud in your

1365
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,480
core

1366
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,200
move that context out to the edge where

1367
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,880
your physical devices out there in your

1368
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,000
physical domain

1369
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
could then put it to good use right so

1370
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,960
the cyber domain can create context

1371
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,760
the physical domain where we drive cars

1372
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,200
or work in buildings or

1373
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,400
or whatever is where you could actually

1374
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,680
actuate

1375
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,440
that information at that point i think

1376
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,800
we have something very very close to

1377
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
most people's definition of ai

1378
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,440
that is machines and devices starting to

1379
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
look like human behaviors

1380
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,520
which are which can be enabled by this

1381
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,359
cyber physical integration

1382
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,720
fast communications like 5g in a fast

1383
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,000
and integrated cyber security

1384
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,280
architecture so

1385
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,720
um it's revolutionary once we get there

1386
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,119
um and we're collectively as a world

1387
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,880
working our way up into that point

1388
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,440
by using machine learning and automation

1389
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,960
but we're rapidly approaching the point

1390
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,359
where

1391
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,880
we just about any of us would call it ai

1392
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,000
thank you mr quaid uh once again for

1393
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
for your answers to these questions and

1394
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,839
and also for your presentation

1395
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,319
uh which included rather many novel

1396
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,599
thoughts ideas say

1397
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,599
and certainly when enhancing cyber

1398
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,079
security we need to have a comprehensive

1399
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,640
approach

1400
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,440
and engage a broad scope of specialists

1401
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
as you highlighted very well

1402
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:49,839
so thank you once again

1403
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,520
since perspectives sink in and allow you

1404
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,880
to get a cup of coffee or stretch your

1405
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,520
legs

1406
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,680
we'll have a 10 minute break after the

1407
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,599
break we will have three parallel

1408
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,559
sessions

1409
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,680
on stage one the session will be on

1410
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,400
civilian sector vulnerabilities to cyber

1411
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,960
attacks

1412
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,119
moderated by commander michael woodman

1413
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,720
head of the strategy branch

1414
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,839
of the ccdcoe and on stage two we'll

1415
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,280
have what should be a very interesting

1416
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,240
discussion on

1417
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,400
ihl principles in the era of new

1418
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,280
technologies

1419
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
moderated by the 10 colonel masmiano

law researcher at the ccdc and finally

1422
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,960
on stage 3 we will have a panel on cyber

1423
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,240
threat intelligence

1424
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,119
titled guest their thoughts moderated by

1427
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,599
in all the sessions use the chance to

1428
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,200
ask questions from the speakers via the

1429
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,400
chat function

1430
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,920
and enjoy your break and see you at the

1431
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:58,070
