00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,599
we hope that the first sessions were

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,960
thought provoking and that the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
discussions were interesting

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
we will now move on to the panel

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
focusing on the european union's

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,000
challenges and outlooks for cyber

it's my great pleasure to welcome you

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,840
all to this conversation

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,319
on eu cyber security policy and its

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,279
impacts globally

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,799
i would like to say first that this

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
discussion is not meant to be

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
only between me and the members of our

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
distinguished panel

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,520
so don't forget that you can submit your

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,680
questions in the chat function

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
on your screen and i will

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
get those questions i will post them to

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,960
our panelists

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
and i will do that towards the end of

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
this session

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
and we'll promise to try to cover as

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
many of them as possible

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
the eu member states have had to deal

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,000
with

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
an onslaught of adversarial cyber

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
activity for a number of years

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
and sadly it has far from subsided

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,399
during the last

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,040
year and a half while we've had also had

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
to deal with the global code 19 pandemic

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
there's been both criminal and

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,240
state-sponsored activities

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,759
and they have continued with a number of

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
substantial attacks against the health

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
care sector

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
and also against politicians and

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
parliaments

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
but at the same time the eu has also

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,840
been active in developing policies

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
regulations and defense defensive

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
frameworks

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
and in promoting norms for responsible

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
state behavior

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
last year we saw eu imposing its first

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
ever sanctions against cyber attacks

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
and in december eu's cyber security

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
strategy for the digital

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
decade was presented

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
i'm thrilled to have with me a panel

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
that i'm sure

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
will have interesting takes on these

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,419

security

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
is at the center of implementing some of

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,879
the policies that we're going to be

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
discussing today

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
welcome next we have paul youngson

committee on defence

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,480
so he's very much involved in the policy

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
making in one of the eu member states

86

security strategy for you

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
welcome and thank you

94
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,599
so i would like to start by taking

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
something from that strategy

96
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
as the starting point for our discussion

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
and then early on in that

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
in that strategy there's a headline uh

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
which talks about

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
um the idea of thinking global and

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
acting european

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
uh so i want to ask you all what that

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
means to you

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
and i'd like to start with you man and

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
since you have been involved in

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,478
actually writing this this strategy

107
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
and formulating it i hope you can also

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
say something on

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,680
how the this idea is reflected in the

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
strategy

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,840
so uh malone the floor is yours

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,479
thank you uh jan and thank you so much

113
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,160
for having me on

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
on this distinguished event it's really

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
an honor to speak here today and

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
unfortunately not

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,840
in person but uh from my study here i'm

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
happy to

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,199
exchange views with you and i hope that

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
some questions will be raised after

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
uh so we can really exchange on some of

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
these issues

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360
so first of all thinking global acting

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
european

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,919
as we all know the eu has a strategy of

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,199
advancing an open uh stable and secure

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
cyber speech which is global which is

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
interoperable

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,960
but at the same time there is also a

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,639
need for the eu

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
to protect itself and to really

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
strengthen in that sense its own

133
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
sovereignty and autonomy

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
and there has been a lot of discussion

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
about what this exactly means

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
and uh there's some different

137
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,759
interpretations there

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
but i think we it's very easy to uh

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,039
share this concept and see it as a way

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
of europeans to take charge in that

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
sense of themselves in an increasingly

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
harsh world and

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
this is something that we have been

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
doing for for years

145
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
and a concept that we have been

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
developing actually since

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,400
uh 216 already and and we're deepening

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
that concept in that sense

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
uh of the union as a political union and

150
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
as a global player and

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
that has also been announced by the

152
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,240
commission as

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
a geopolitical commission in that sense

154
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,639
uh it does not mean that we are

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
not fostering our traditional alliances

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
and our traditional partnerships

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,600
however we also acknowledge uh that

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
in the long term uh the eu has to

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
increasingly take charge of of its own

160
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
um uh protection and

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
our security to defend our interests and

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,240
values

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
in what is really uh becoming

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
a more harsher and complex environment

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
and the cyber security within that

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,840
structure

167
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,479
is really a key component both of the

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,039
europe's

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,680
digital future of its recovery plan as

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
well as of its security union strategy

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
and of course its global uh strategy

172
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
for that matter it's really there to

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,440
bolster

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
uh the eu's resilience against cyber

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
threats on one hand

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,000
but on the other hand also to advance

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
this global open stable and secure

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
cyberspace and to really

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
have this full spectrum whole of

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
government approach

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,440
when it comes to cyber security and the

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
cyber security strategy there

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
is also uh in three main pillars

184
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
one that is aimed at increasing our

185
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,800
resilience

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
and increasing our technological

187
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
sovereignty and our leadership

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
in cyberspace where the commission has

189
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
put forward several strands

190
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,720
as reform for instance rules on security

191
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
of network and information systems

192
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
under the nis directive as we all know

193
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
it as nis 2

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
but also to increase the level of

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
specifically critical public and private

196
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
sectors

197
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,720
as well as increase uh awareness and

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
capacities

199
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
of um of the workforce as well as of

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
small and medium businesses so

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
among the full spectrum from the user to

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
private sector to the critical

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,879
infrastructure

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,120
as well as governments really trying to

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,199
to boost this resilience as one of the

206
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
core elements of the eu cyber security

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
strategy

208
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
and also using insurance such as

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,840
security operation centers across the eu

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
using new technologies to really make

211
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
sure that we are

212
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
able to offer that protection to all

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
businesses citizens and governments in

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,919
in the eu we further build on that by

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
also building further operational

216
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,240
capacity

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
to prevent a deterrent respond to

218
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
malicious cyber activities

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
using all the instruments and all the

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
pillars and the communities that we have

221
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,599
within the eu

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,919
and first of all we have launched there

223
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,879
the commission and the high

224
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,000
representative

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
in the strategy uh a proposal to

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,479
establish a joint cyber unit which has

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,840
taken the lead

228
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
uh by the commission but certainly the

229
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
high representative is also contributing

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,719
to this as we see

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
merit and really having all those

232
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,799
communities work together

233
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,159
in making sure that we are able to

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
protect ourselves as europeans and at

235
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
the same time protect

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
also this global open stability secures

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
cyber space

238
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
and there we see also development with

239
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
each in of these communities and under

240
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
the high representative that means

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
the development of the cyber diplomacy

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,000
community

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
on one hand really promoting responsible

244
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
behavior promoting

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
this global and open cyber space as well

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
as protecting it by using diplomatic

247
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
means and you already have referred to

248
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
the first time that the european union

249
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
has imposed restrictive measures uh to

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
individuals and entities that were

251
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
responsible for or involved in

252
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
cyber attacks or attempted cyber attacks

253
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
against the union

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
and the same we have done also in

255
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,560
october uh when we

256
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,040
imposed further restrictive measures to

257
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
such actors

258
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
uh that said we we really see

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
the merit and really taking this

260
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,040
approach from

261
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,399
from from an international perspective

262
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
the need to really advance this global

263
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
and open cyber space to really prevent

264
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
such behavior in the first place by

265
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
having this resilience

266
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
by having the ability to use also these

267
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
diplomatic measures

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
to counter but foremost also by

269
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
promoting the eu's vision of cyberspace

270
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
and in that regard we have built this

271
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
third pillar of the cyber security

272
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,480
strategy

273
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
around the fact that we have a certain

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
vision of cyberspace of cyberspace being

275
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,760
global

276
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
thinking global but at the same time

277
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
also promoting these european union

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,040
values

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
of human rights fundamental freedoms

280
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
respect for the rule of law

281
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
and translating those in international

282
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
norms and standards really advancing

283
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
those to make sure that everyone can

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
reap the benefits of it

285
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
so we see that on the standardization

286
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
side on the fact of

287
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
how criminal behavior is countered how

288
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,959
we

289
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,720
promote responsible state behavior in

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,399
cyberspace and how we promote and

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,920
protect human rights and fundamental

292
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
freedoms

293
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,880
we have put forward the vision there

294
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
from the european uh perspective

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,560
which is universalized within numerous

296
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
united nations documents as well as on

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
which we cooperate with partners

298
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
and then to say okay we need to also

299
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
strengthen our partnerships

300
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,200
both with public entities with

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
other countries with international

302
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
organizations as well as with the

303
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
private sector in this regard

304
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,720
and also help other countries to

305
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
meaningfully participate

306
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
by not only helping them in capacity

307
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
building

308
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,200
to to counter cyber threats or to tackle

309
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,160
cyber crime

310
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
but also to see if we can support them

311
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,200
to really

312
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
participate in these global debates uh

313
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,399
on

314
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,959
uh on these issues such as responsible

315
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
safe behavior or

316
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
uh countering criminal behavior and for

317
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,959
that we really see the link between

318
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,399
the eu as a player as a strong global

319
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,200
player

320
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
in uh this global debate uh on cyber uh

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
security and cyber crime

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
so um i think from that from my side uh

323
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,120
that's

324
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
that's my initial contribution but again

325
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,959
i look very much forward to the further

326
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,680
exchange

327
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
that we will have today thank you so

328
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
much thank you thank you very much

329
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
it's really good to hear that you speak

330
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,760
about

331
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
protecting those european values

332
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,959
not making this just a technical

333
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,880
technical issue and

334
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
and also to hear

335
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
us do you describe eu as a global power

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,560
and i hope we'll use that to the best

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,959
effect

338
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,800
uh evangelist uh you're up next uh

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
what does thinking global acting

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,000
european mean to you

341
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
and can you say a little about how that

342
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
can be seen in in isis work

343
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
yes so first of all thank you for

344
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
inviting me it's a great pleasure to be

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
here with you today in this very nice

346
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,120
event

347
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,519
and as you know elisa is quite active in

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
the area of

349
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
cyber security policy development and

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
implementation and

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
in my opinion this eu sub security

352
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,880
strategy is probably one of the most

353
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,519
elaborated documents

354
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,160
outlining many many important actions

355
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
you know and

356
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
i think we all can be very proud of

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
of these initiatives and all these

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,079
proposals

359
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
i'll start with this so it's a great

360
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
piece of work which demonstrates in my

361
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
opinion as well the

362
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
maturity that we have reached as a

363
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
european

364
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
union as a member states

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,620
as eu organizations as well

366
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,839
[Music]

367
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,480
now when it comes to the phenomenon we

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
all know that cyber security is a global

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
phenomenon

370
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
we know very well that there are no

371
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
borders and attacks you know can be

372
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
launched for everywhere

373
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
and we have personal experience all of

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,560
us

375
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
from this and for that reason

376
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
our efforts should be global and it's

377
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
important you know to see all dimensions

378
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
also the international aspects

379
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
and to understand the phenomenon and the

380
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,720
characteristics of

381
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
it from a global perspective however to

382
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,639
see

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
very tangible results we have to focus

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
and we have to focus on our

385
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
characteristics on our specificities on

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
the things that

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
we have as europeans and there are a lot

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
of

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
things that we are very good at on cyber

390
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
security

391
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
so first of all we have an agency like

392
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,680
nissa who

393
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
operates for many years and there are

394
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
other sister

395
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,440
agencies organizations you know with

396
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
growing

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
knowledge and expertise on this

398
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
in this field so you know very well

399
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,839
ec3 and and other bodies

400
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,279
and in my opinion this knowledge and

401
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
this expertise you know can help

402
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
also we have seen the member states are

403
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,560
developing a lot of capabilities a lot

404
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,839
of expertise

405
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
a lot of knowledge they all have now a

406
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
cyber security strategy

407
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
and the ni's directive also paved the

408
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,839
way for a

409
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
common level playing field i can use the

410
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,880
term

411
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,639
not all countries are of the same level

412
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
of maturity but emapping

413
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
they are almost all above a certain

414
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
baseline

415
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
all the private sector as well in europe

416
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
was always very good on cyber security

417
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,279
we have

418
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
a few important cyber security players

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,519
you know in

420
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
european players and there are some

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
areas where we are still scoring quite

422
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
high

423
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
in terms of innovation products and so

424
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,399
on so

425
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
so this means that europe is a is a big

426
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,160
global player you know

427
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
cyber security and this strategy comes

428
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,600
actually on time

429
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
to reinforce exactly this and say we are

430
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,519
here

431
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,240
we are europeans we take ownership we

432
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,279
are accountable

433
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,800
for this and we are have our own

434
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
strategy and this strategy

435
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,079
basically covers all these aspects that

436
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,959
manon already outlined in my opinion

437
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,240
this is important you know

438
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,199
as europe as a continent to position

439
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,680
itself

440
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,639
vis-a-vis the other global players and

441
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
strike for a

442
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,199
certain understanding or even

443
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,600
collaboration cooperation in some cases

444
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,880
now when it comes to nissa the agency

445
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,399
is quite known for developing good

446
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,240
practices in several areas

447
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,560
my unit and myself are for many many

448
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
years you know helping the members in

449
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
implementing

450
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
policies so we have for example assisted

451
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
the commission and the member states in

452
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,560
implementing the nice directive

453
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,160
he is in the past telecom framework

454
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,519
the incident reporting notification but

455
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,160
also recently with a modernization let's

456
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
say of elisa with a new mandate the csa

457
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
we got responsibilities to deal with

458
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,560
certification

459
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
we are building up you know our

460
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,399
operational

461
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
capacity and we are assisting now

462
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
operational entities in europe

463
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
uh for example through the system

464
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
network

465
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
and we have a very important team that

466
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,639
deals with capacity building

467
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
for many many years we have delivered

468
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,199
you know exercises like cyber europe

469
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
we offer trainings to institutions like

470
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
scissors and so on

471
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,600
and of course there is some work done

472
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
already on awareness raising and other

473
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,480
related activities so the agencies

474
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,959
is becoming a reference you know in this

475
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
area and the strategy actually

476
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,160
highlights a lot the importance of nissa

477
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,199
and

478
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
highlights also areas where nissa can

479
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
play a role like for example 5g where we

480
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
have already contributed a lot

481
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
we have developed a toolkit together

482
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,959
with the member states

483
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
and the commission we have definitely

484
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
played an important role in the ns

485
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
directive

486
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,400
and we are somehow going to play an

487
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
important role as well you know in

488
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
these aspects in this areas in the

489
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,760
future um

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
the only way to improve cyber security

491
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,160
is to act

492
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
local you have to engage the players you

493
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
have to engage the stakeholders this is

494
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,440
where the trust is

495
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
this is where you know the capacities

496
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
and

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,679
as i said in europe we don't have one

498
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,240
let's say

499
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,679
level of maturity there are different

500
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
levels of maturity so that's why we have

501
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,720
to continue

502
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,799
working and this strategy is a very

503
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
important document but it's not the end

504
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
of this trip it's a it's an important

505
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,039
milestone we will definitely remember

506
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,400
this but

507
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
still a lot of things need to be done

508
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,320
and the strategy outlines them

509
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,039
operational cooperation the joint cyber

510
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,880
summary unit

511
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,640
further actions you know 5g you know the

512
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
a nice directive but also other cyber

513
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,799
security related actions like the

514
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,960
artificial intelligence regulation

515
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,520
the upcoming either so you know work

516
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,559
that has

517
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,200
some flavor on cyber security cr

518
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,679
also and dora and other related

519
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
activities which are

520
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
you know more secretorial next year

521
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
maybe electric

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,840
the electricity code network code for

523
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,039
the energy sector so these are all signs

524
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,559
that we as a society are

525
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,360
becoming better and we act together and

526
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,559
we

527
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,880
join forces you know to achieve better

528
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
security for europe

529
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,600
and in my opinion the document that the

530
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
cyber security strategy

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,400
is basically demonstrates this

532
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
highlights this understanding of this

533
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
maturity so

534
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
we can all be very proud you know of of

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
this work

536
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,559
thank you thank and you you mentioned

537
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,000
denise as uh

538

as a reference uh so i i hope you can be

539
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080

540
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
reference for others as well uh

541
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
paul uh get to you last

542
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120

543
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,919
and

544
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,320
maybe you can comment uh something also

545
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,039
on uh

546
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
how you combine acting european with

547
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,160
acting

548
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,400
nationally as as you have to do

549
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
absolutely john uh i'd be delighted to

550
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
let me also say

551
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
thank you very much to cycom for having

552
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
me on this terrific panel

553
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
as a politician as a defense generalist

554
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,760
i feel

555
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
terribly out gunned when it comes to

556
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,159
expertise into cyber security i just

557
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
want to have that disclaimer i just also

558
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,440
want to say that

559
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
since i belong to the opposition i don't

560
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,640
speak on behalf of the swedish

561
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
government

562
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
just a few reflections on john on the

563
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
question you post about thinking global

564
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
but acting european what does it really

565
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,039
mean

566
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,120
well in essence to my mind it should

567
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
mean that the eu will be a force for

568
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,480
good in the digital world

569
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
both for its own citizens and for others

570
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,799
and just as manon alluded to we are of

571
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,520
course

572
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
exposed now to a much more intensive

573
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
great power competition

574
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
i think there is a very strong

575
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
correlation between

576
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
stability in the cyber domain and

577
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600
stability in international politics

578
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
i also know there's a lot of talks these

579
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
days about enhancing and strengthening

580
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,679
eu strategic autonomy

581
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,760
i think it's reasonable that europe take

582
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,120
a more responsible or small possibility

583
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
also for its own security in the cyber

584
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
domain at the same time i would caution

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,039
against any kind of

586
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
protectionist more isolationist

587
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
tendencies

588
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,840
because when it comes to a cyber domain

589
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
i also think that we need to work much

590
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
more extensively

591
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
with other like-minded liberal

592
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,000
democracies

593
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,919
in general and i think also it's very

594
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,600
important that we actually strengthen

595
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
transatlantic cooperation

596
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
when it comes to cyber and

597
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
digitalization therefore i

598
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
strongly also welcome the initiative of

599
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
having this transatlantic

600
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
technology and trade council even though

601
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
i realize it's going to be a tall order

602
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,000
of

603
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
issues that such a council would have to

604
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
discuss and elaborate on

605
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,559
uh also john since you said i do not

606
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
represent any eu institution i thought i

607
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,000
could take a little bit of a

608
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
national perspective on eu cooperation

609
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,600
in cyber

610
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
and try to make three points for

611
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
stating the obvious of course eu

612
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
cooperation is not the only game in town

613
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
when it comes to cyber security

614
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
it is of course first and foremost a

615
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
national responsibility to ensure a

616
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
high level of cyber security this is an

617
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,640
issues that

618
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
is strongly entangled into vital

619
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,640
national security interests and also

620
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,919
increasingly into the

621
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
economic competitiveness of the member

622
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,080
states thus i think

623
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
sovereignty and national security issues

624
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
is gonna shape

625
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,679
also the conditions where the eu will be

626
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
operating in the future when it comes to

627
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,200
cyber security in addition i also want

628
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
to point out that sweden

629
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
not only cooperate on an eu level we

630
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
also cooperate quite

631
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
extensively among the other nordic

632
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
countries on cyber securities and i

633
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,360
think there

634
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
is quite strong reasons for that all the

635
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
nordic countries are

636
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,840
exposed to a similar threat landscape we

637
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,520
have reached about the same level of

638
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,120
maturity when it comes to

639
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,320
digitalization and most of all a lot of

640
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
our digital infrastructure is

641
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
such as telecom banking and financial

642
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
services are strongly intertwined and

643
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,559
connected

644
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,559
thus our third teams to joint exercises

645
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,640
as those are government authorities the

646
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
authorities

647
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,720
as you also might know the nordic prime

648
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
ministers actually stated the vision

649
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
that the nordic region should be the

650
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,280
most

651
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,760
integrated 5g region in the world in the

652
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,559
future

653
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,320
now i'm not saying there's a competition

654
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
between nordic operation and

655
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
eu cooperation since we're working on

656
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
the same standards that actually the eu

657
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:20,960
provide

658
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,640
in this area but i'm saying that

659
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,679
among all the 27 i think in the future

660
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
just as in defense corporations i think

661
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
you will find

662
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
islands of deeper cooperation among

663
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
certain member states but all based on

664
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,039
the kind of standards that the eu

665
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,000
provides

666
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,799
second point this said the u.s indeed

667
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,520
provided

668
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,360
us and other member states with very

669
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,600
helpful tools we talked before by the

670
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,159
nis

671
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,840
directive before sweden joined the ns

672
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
agreement then we we actually did not

673
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
have a national cyber security

674
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,640
strategy we did not have uh mandatory

675
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,559
incidenting reporting and i think that

676
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,440
the

677
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,080
nis directive actually provided a useful

678
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,039
sector system

679
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
for critical information security and

680
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
infra

681
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,360
in critical infrastructure so uh so

682
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,679
indeed the eu has helped us advance our

683
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,279
own cyber security

684
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,400
same goes for the eu toolbox on 5g

685
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
i think been helpful um so um third

686
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
point then

687
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
what i would ask from the eu maybe is a

688
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,720
better coordination sometimes when

689
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
you're sitting in the national com

690
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,120
capitals it feels like an avalanche of

691
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
different initiatives that come to you

692
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
best of both in relations to cyber

693
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,080
security and critical infrastructure

694
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
here i would welcome a closer

695
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,760
coordination for example between anissa

696
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,279
and europol ec3 i would welcome

697
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,640
a strong coordination between the pesco

698
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
projects the

699
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
edf projects and horizon on cyber

700
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,039
security

701
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,120
i think it's kind of important also that

702
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
we we

703
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
in when we're working with the strategic

704
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,159
compass that we actually

705
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
think uh think informally

706
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,120
well informed about the eu's

707
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
cybersecurity strategy especially when

708
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
we're dealing with the basket

709
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
of of uh resilience um

710
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
and of course dating the obvious here

711
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,760
but the stronger eu

712
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,120
nato cooperation uh i think also is

713
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
vital and of course we've made a lot of

714
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,240
progress on this area

715
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,360
since the whale summits in 2016 but i

716
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
would welcome any further measures

717
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
but i'll stop there okay thank you very

718
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,039
much paul

719
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
it must be exciting to to try to work on

720
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
all these levels

721
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,960
at the same time and i'm also happy to

722
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,520
hear that

723
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,559
uh the eu is actually a

724
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
venue where we can drive some of these

725
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,679
questions and and

726
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,480
and get them done in the nations so

727
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
there is value in this

728
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
cooperation in that way as well

729
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,000
before we go on is there any one of you

730
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
that would like to make any comments on

731
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
on each other's

732
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,240
statements here i i thought i saw a man

733
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
on

734
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,480
at least smiling at some comments so

735
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,440
um i was i was smiling indeed that the

736
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
comment also on

737
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
strategic autonomy and the cooperation

738
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,159
with with partners because

739
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,159
on one hand um i i already

740
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,720
when i started my talk noted it that

741
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,159
this is a concept which is

742
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,120
is often misunderstood and and uh which

743
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
should by no means

744
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,000
be understood as as as a lack of

745
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,640
cooperation with uh with other partners

746
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,039
and

747
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,320
indeed i i really underline that

748
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,279
especially on cyber security there is a

749
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,320
a

750
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
need for us to really have this

751
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
cooperation have close transatlantic

752
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
cooperation

753
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,039
as well as like-minded cooperation and

754
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,559
that is something that we see

755
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
both when it comes to promoting

756
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
responsible behavior when having this

757
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,559
coordination setting the standard

758
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,120
setting

759
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,480
uh uh international uh norms uh

760
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
of of behavior um currently

761
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,159
we are uh for instance in in un

762
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,520
negotiations on

763
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,320
uh the in the third committee on uh

764
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,399
countering criminal behavior

765
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,159
and next week we have the organizational

766
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,159
meeting of the next open-ended working

767
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:26,799
group

768
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,679
uh we are jointly uh promoting also the

769
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,120
program of action

770
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
uh forward to events uh responsible

771
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
state behavior

772
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
uh with over 53 partners

773
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,200
around the world uh trying to create a

774
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,000
permanent

775
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,799
platform uh for member states you and

776
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,480
member states in the u.n to really

777
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
to have this cooperation and really

778
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
implement uh some of the

779
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
things that we have been able to agree

780
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
over the last years but also when it

781
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,000
comes to

782
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,919
cooperation on the cyber diplomacy

783
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
toolbox and the diplomatic responses in

784
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,279
that regard

785
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,320
where uh numerous occasions we have had

786
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
coordinated responses most recently when

787
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,159
it comes to the

788
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
reaction to the solar wind cyber

789
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
operation but also

790
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,360
again referring back to the cyber

791
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
sanctions that we put out

792
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
over in july where we had around 10

793
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
partners uh very vocal on supporting the

794
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,440
eu

795
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,559
applauding the eu on on that decision

796
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
uh to to really advance responsible

797
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
state behavior and to really

798
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,600
influence the behavior thereof with

799
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
imposing those sanctions so there is

800
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,559
a lot of cooperation another example

801
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
last week we we organized as

802
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,000
eu an exercise with 11

803
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,679
international partners plus all eu

804
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,200
member states on

805
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,679
uh diplomatic engagement in cyberspace

806
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,399
so

807
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
i i can only underline the importance of

808
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
it at the same time i also underlined

809
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,760
the needs

810
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,840
for the eu to really protect itself

811
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,039
protected citizens and

812
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,600
businesses from from cyber threats and

813
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,039
therefore i think that

814
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,840
uh especially uh thinking global acting

815
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
european is fits very well together so

816
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,480
uh thank you ann for for spotting my

817
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,640
smile and letting me play

818
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,120
okay i think we should move on and my

819
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,080
first question is

820
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
actually related to those sanctions uh

821
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
one of the tools in in the use cyber

822
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
diplomacy toolbox

823
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,080
and eu imposed sanctions uh or

824
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
uh restricted measures on on both

825
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
individuals and entities in russia and

826
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,799
china

827
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,159
in response to some of the most

828
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,640
prominent cyber attacks in recent years

829
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,520
including wannacry not petya cloudhopper

830
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,200
and eventually also the hacks against

831
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
the german bundestag

832
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,159
so these are attacks going back all the

833
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,960
way to 2015

834
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,360
and it's of course a quite clear signal

835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
to those responsible for those attacks

836
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
but is it effective and

837
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
these sanctions are not implying

838
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,360
any official attribution of the attacks

839
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,520
to a state

840
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,399
would nations jointly attributing

841
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,120
attacks

842
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,679
help make a bigger impact than than we

843
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,200
get from from this uh

844
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
manon can you would you care to continue

845
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
no definitely definitely no no problem

846
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,399
and i think the

847
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,799
the cyber sanctions regime the

848
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,559
autonomous horizontal cyber sanctions

849
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,360
the gene of the eu which only exists

850
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,399
since 2019 so that it hasn't uh dealt

851
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:26,799
with

852
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,960
more recent attacks uh also has to do

853
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
with the fact it's only established in

854
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,559
in in 2019 it's it's part of the wider

855
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
assembly of diplomacy effort of the eu

856
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,320
and it really merits for us to really go

857
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
back a bit of

858
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,760
where the sanctions regime is part of

859
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,919
this cyber diplomacy toolbox which is

860
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,559
there

861
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,679
um to really encourage uh cooperation

862
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,840
and mitigate cyber threats and influence

863
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,720
behavior

864
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,000
to see if we can um

865
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
have actors refrain in the end from

866
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,200
undertaking

867
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,159
uh such behavior but also to establish a

868
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
certain normative framework by pointing

869
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,039
out

870
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,760
behavior that we find unacceptable and

871
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
this cyber diplomacy toolbox which is

872
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,720
part of our wider cyber diplomacy policy

873
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
is there to prevent deter and respond to

874
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,840
malicious

875
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,799
behavior in cyberspace using the full

876
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,120
range of measures that we have at our

877
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
disposal and

878
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,600
restrictive measures is just one of this

879
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,799
one of these tools that we have and

880
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,440
we also don't see this tool necessarily

881
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
nor any other tool or nor the ability

882
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
of the eu of member states to to

883
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,799
attribute malicious labor activities in

884
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,640
a vacuum we see this

885
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,399
as part of a longer term strategy

886
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,799
where we can have a sustained effort

887
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,760
over time

888
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
to counter malicious behavior in

889
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,919
cyberspace and the horizontal cyber

890
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
sanctions regime which indeed addresses

891
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,640
individuals and entities so it's very

892
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
focused it has a specific

893
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,159
legal scope to it so it addresses

894
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,919
individuals and entities involved in

895
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,200
cyber attacks or

896
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,880
attempted cyber attacks with a

897
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
significant effect

898
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
uh to the union or its member states is

899
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,159
part of that

900
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,240
effort is part of uh that um a

901
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,440
union toolbox so to say uh to promote

902
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,519
our cfsp objectives

903
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,320
that include peace democracy respect of

904
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
rule of law

905
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,000
human rights but also that is aimed to

906
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,120
really prevent

907
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,399
conflicts in cyberspace and it's not

908
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,880
there to punish necessarily or to

909
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
retaliate but it's there to

910
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,600
bring a change in policy or activity by

911
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
the targeted countries

912
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,200
uh or the end entities or the

913
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
individuals in case of the horizontal

914
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,399
cybersex

915
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
regime and these measures are very

916
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
targeted but they are not the only

917
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,159
measures that we are using we're using

918
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
also public communication measures we're

919
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:52,799
using

920
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,519
measures such as private the marshes as

921
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:55,919
uh

922
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,080
efforts that we do in the oece when it

923
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,320
comes to confidence building measures

924
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
so we're not only using sanctions or

925
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
restrictive measures in that sense

926
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,480
to influence that behavior but we're

927
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,559
using this full package

928
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,000
to send messages to shape expectations

929
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
regarding malicious cyber activities

930
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,840
that will not be tolerated by us

931
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
and to build also international

932
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
consensus around

933
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,279
abnormal normative framework and around

934
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,000
the need

935
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,960
to really advance security and stability

936
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
by respecting the rule of law by

937
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,360
applying international law in cyberspace

938
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,120
by adhering by these norms of

939
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,799
responsible state behavior

940
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,559
and through that the restrictive

941
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,080
measures the sanctions regime can

942
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,960
contribute

943
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
to the term malicious actors uh from

944
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,519
undertaking these uh these activities

945
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,039
um and also to show that we do not

946
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,039
accept this that we show solidarity with

947
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,760
the victims

948
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,519
that we showed the solidarity with our

949
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
allies and that we push back on this

950
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,960
malicious behavior so in that sense it

951
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,519
is not

952
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,080
a tool which is standing on its own it's

953
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,519
part of a package

954
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,559
it's part of a longer term strategy to

955
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,000
really have a sustained effort

956
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,840
countering back and with the cyber

957
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,399
security strategy to to pick back on uh

958
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,719
on what we have been discussing before

959
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,719
we have put out proposals that would

960
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,760
even strengthen

961
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,918
uh not only the cyber sanctions regime

962
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,320
in that regard but the whole approach

963
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,239
by really strengthening our shared

964
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,760
situation awareness

965
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,239
strengthening our deterrence posture or

966
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,879
posture

967
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,359
in cyberspace to push back on such

968
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,800
malicious cyber

969
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,280
malicious behavior in cyberspace and at

970
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,040
the same time also strengthening

971
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,359
our cooperation both with partners

972
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,199
within the eu for instance through the

973
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,879
joint cyber unit which is to be

974
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,399
established but also with

975
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,399
international partners in that regard

976
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
and through that package

977
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,480
we hope and we are determined in that

978
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
sense to to push back on on this

979
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,599
behavior making sure

980
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,159
that everyone can reap the benefits of

981
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,119
of uh of cyberspace and the internet so

982
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
um i would i know there's always a

983
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
discussion about

984
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,880
sanctions and are they effective and are

985
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
they working but they really need to be

986
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
seen as a part of a broader uh effort by

987
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,640
the eu

988
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,920
as well as by by our partners okay thank

989
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,880
you

990
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
uh paul what is your take on this

991
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,599
now quite similar i mean if you're

992
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,960
aiming for alter

993
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,440
altering immediate behavior you're gonna

994
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
be up for a disappointment of course but

995
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,560
that's the same

996
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
logic that caused with sanctions in

997
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,000
general that it's difficult

998
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,560
to to achieve your goals very very

999
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,839
quickly

1000
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,240
are they quick enough these sanctions no

1001
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,040
probably not

1002
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
on the other side we also know that

1003
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,119
other sanctions and restrictive measures

1004
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,680
the u.s unfortunately been slow on its

1005
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,240
mind

1006
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
for example vis-a-vis belarus i think we

1007
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
have the similar challenge there

1008
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,520
uh then joint attribution and

1009
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,400
coordinated

1010
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,560
attribution i would welcome it i think

1011
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
it would be

1012
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,960
very effective as a strong statement

1013
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,800
but we all know the challenges and that

1014
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
is that the member states don't always

1015
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
feel comfortable sharing intelligence

1016
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,000
among each others

1017
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
because they want to not reveal their

1018
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,079
sources and i think this is

1019
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,839
a fact that we're going to be living

1020
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,920
with for for some time so

1021
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,079
even though it would be desirable i

1022
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,440
think it's kind of

1023
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
a little bit in the too hard to do books

1024
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
yet but let me say i

1025
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,240
also strongly welcome the eu diplomatic

1026
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,359
toolboxes as

1027
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,680
an initiative and i think it's there is

1028
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
a way for the eu also to be better

1029
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,599
prepared and

1030
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,400
for for having good responses also into

1031
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,359
the digital domain

1032
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
thank you very much uh evangelist do you

1033
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,960
have a comment on this

1034
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,040
topic yes i mean as you know nissa is

1035
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
not an operational agency so in that

1036
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,800
respect you know we don't

1037
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,640
deal with attribution and is

1038
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
not within our mandate but um definitely

1039
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
there are organizations you know

1040
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
within member states and at the eu level

1041
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
that are uh

1042
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,359
somehow dealing with this matter a map

1043
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,800
you know this is an important component

1044
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
of a sanction you know you

1045
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,480
need to have some evidence you know and

1046
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
to build up

1047
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,880
and this evidences so that's the first

1048
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,359
thing

1049
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,040
and i think europe is getting better you

1050
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
know at building up the evidences

1051
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,720
and developing its capabilities with

1052
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
regards to attribution

1053
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
and yes there are difficulties in

1054
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
collaboration at operational level

1055
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160
and sharing information sometimes it's a

1056
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,200
little bit tricky but

1057
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,119
this is getting also a little bit better

1058
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,400
so in that respect

1059
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,920
i think the procedure the mechanism you

1060
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
know for uh

1061
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,920
attributing attacks will be

1062
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,119
better and better and better in the

1063
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,599
future so overall as soon as you have

1064
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
the facts and you can

1065
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,800
say you know using some common sense

1066
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,320
some logic some

1067
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,240
forensics you know from where the attack

1068
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
is coming from then you need to

1069
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,040
demonstrate you know all the things that

1070
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,560
manon said

1071
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,160
very nicely um so you cannot just

1072
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,880
sit expecting to be attacked without

1073
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
responding you know

1074
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,160
and i think the most educated the most

1075
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,119
diplomatic approach is the sanctions

1076
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,000
which are

1077
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,839
not meant to punish but mostly to

1078
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,160
educate to explain

1079
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,079
what is an acceptable behavior or what

1080
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,720
is not yeah and yes there are some

1081
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
and and there europe is getting better

1082
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,760
we have you know all the diplomatic

1083
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
you know experience from other areas

1084
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,079
from other let's say experiences

1085
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,320
that we can definitely use it's a great

1086
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,839
also

1087
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
it's quite important to see that

1088
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,280
ministries of foreign affairs are

1089
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,119
you know getting more familiar with

1090
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,040
cyber security matters

1091
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
and they take ownership of it it's also

1092
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
important to see that not only at

1093
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,839
national level but at eu level the topic

1094
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,280
of cyber security

1095
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,200
is one of the important elements you

1096
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,040
know in discussions with

1097
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
for example countries outside of the

1098
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
union so as part of

1099
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,760
important strategic dialogue with them

1100
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,599
and

1101
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,640
again we have built up

1102
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,839
this culture and in mapping this is

1103
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,480
important

1104
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
to so where is the baseline now when it

1105
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,400
comes to the time

1106
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,720
yes at eu you know bringing all the

1107
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
member states together discussing

1108
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
agreeing might take a little bit time

1109
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,480
but

1110
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,280
you know europe is very well known for

1111
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,000
you know taking

1112
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,440
very calm very educated very

1113
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,640
you know risk-based functional you know

1114
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,839
fact-based decisions so

1115
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,240
from one side we might be sometimes not

1116
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,760
always but sometimes we might be a

1117
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,440
little bit late in responding but at the

1118
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
same time

1119
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
when europe reacts then definitely it is

1120
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,440
factual it is based on evidence

1121
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,480
it is proportionate and there was enough

1122
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,320
debate and discussion you know among the

1123
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,200
member states

1124
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
and nobody feels uncomfortable with this

1125
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,920
so things can only get better in this

1126
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
area

1127
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
and we have already went through

1128
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,599
a big way forward over the years and i

1129
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,440
think the cyber security strategy

1130
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,240
with the diplomatic toolbox and also you

1131
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,440
know the efforts uh

1132
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,760
that alien manual and others you know

1133
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,200
actually paved the way for

1134
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,240
for this so

1135
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
thank you thank you very much uh

1136
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
yeah i i hope that uh that you're right

1137
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,440
and that

1138
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,400
this this statement will uh actually

1139
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
influence others and and tell them what

1140
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
what is acceptable and start building

1141
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,480
that

1142
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,880
um common agreement on what that is

1143
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,520
from this question about response i'm

1144
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
going to move to question

1145
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,160
more about protection i guess and

1146
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
the background for that is something

1147
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,359
that's been

1148
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,319
in the news and talked about a lot

1149
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
namely

1150
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,720
another toolbox one for cyber security

1151
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
of 5g networks

1152
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,040
and behind that toolbox was an eu

1153
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,359
coordinated risk assessment

1154
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,400
and uh i'm i'm

1155
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,800
wondering now uh will will this warrior

1156
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,760
working uh

1157
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
be applied to other areas in the future

1158
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,839
and will we see

1159
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,359
a further toolboxes or improved toolbox

1160
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,400
for for 5g

1161
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,680
in the future and and will the

1162
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,839
risk assessments carried out in this way

1163
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,520
as a

1164
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,640
coordinated eu effort

1165
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,480
bring out the right risks and the

1166
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,839
relevant risks

1167
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,880
to build those measures on and i'm going

1168
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,200
to

1169
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,800
give this question to you first

1170
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,359
evangelist

1171
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,440
okay thank you so look the 5g

1172
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,520
is an example of europe taking

1173
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,720
leadership and

1174
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,200
acting very quickly for european

1175
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,040
standards that was very very quick so

1176
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,319
within three months there was a

1177
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,680
recommendation

1178
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
then after the recommendation the member

1179
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,119
states had three months to respond with

1180
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,599
a national risk assessment

1181
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,680
the member states issued a consolidated

1182
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,119
risk assessment

1183
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,680
early october and the toolbox you know

1184
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,319
was proposed already in january so

1185
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,160
in less than a year from a

1186
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,520
recommendation

1187
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,319
to something very specific very tangible

1188
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,680
like the toolbox

1189
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
was actually phenomenal and i can tell

1190
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,839
you that

1191
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,240
all continents actually were very much

1192
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,359
impressed

1193
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,319
because europe like i as i explained

1194
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,119
before took

1195
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,400
a very scientific a very

1196
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
factual a very risk-based approach so

1197
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,839
and that was quite quite good in my

1198
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,119
opinion because

1199
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,440
we went down to the technical and the

1200
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,560
strategic you know

1201
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
measures we have identified technical

1202
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,400
strategic risks

1203
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,359
we have given you know a repair to our

1204
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,240
tools

1205
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
you know that member states can use

1206
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,319
without restricting their freedom

1207
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,480
and they had you know an opportunity to

1208
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,599
mix the tools

1209
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,680
in the best possible way and even you

1210
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,520
know add additional tools

1211
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
so this flexibility in my opinion was

1212
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,480
necessary to deal with a topic like 5g

1213
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,000
and this shows that in difficult topics

1214
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,119
like 5g for example that's there is a

1215
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,000
beauty in it

1216
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,520
and the end result was

1217
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,560
basically independent of a

1218
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
vendors independent of uh you know

1219
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,119
technologies was independent also

1220
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,880
of uh states or uh or countries you know

1221
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,440
that's that was that's quite significant

1222
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,119
and i believe that that's that's the way

1223
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:37,760
to go

1224
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,880
on similar topics and

1225
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
it was very phenomenal to see as well

1226
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,800
that all countries united forces

1227
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,640
and they all contributed they took

1228
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,839
ownership of it

1229
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,560
so just to tell you that a few countries

1230
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,079
have acted as chairs

1231
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,560
of this initiative and there were

1232
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,480
several countries actually candidating

1233
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,800
you know to be the chairs and co-chairs

1234
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,359
of this initiative and at the end of the

1235
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,119
day they all took ownership who had

1236
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,640
several meetings and they worked very

1237
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,920
hard you know

1238
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,839
it's not very obvious and

1239
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,960
this this this shows i believe that in

1240
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
the future we might have you know an

1241
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,200
update of the toolbox not very soon but

1242
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,240
maybe

1243
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,040
in the coming years and definitely there

1244
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,079
might be

1245
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,720
situations like 5g where we might have

1246
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,040
to respond in a similar way

1247
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,440
and i cannot give you a concrete example

1248
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,160
because

1249
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,200
that might be maybe inappropriate but i

1250
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,079
think that

1251
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,079
policymakers in brussels the member

1252
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,440
states themselves

1253
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,480
they have very good experiences of this

1254
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,319
methodology and they have

1255
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,440
slightly used this you know for the

1256
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
mobile tracing up apps you know that

1257
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,680
have been developed last year they have

1258
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,359
developed a toolbox again

1259
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,240
it was not exactly like the 5g but it

1260
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,040
was

1261
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,079
the footsteps of this initiative so

1262
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,880
in the future we might see more

1263
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,960
consolidated risk assessments and

1264
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
toolboxes like the one that we did with

1265
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,319
the member states before

1266
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,160
thank you thank you uh paul uh

1267
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,880
perhaps you you have some comment on how

1268
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
has this helped

1269
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
sweden in tackling this question and and

1270
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,400
do you see other questions where it

1271
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,520
could uh

1272
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,960
could be helpful with the same approach

1273
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,720
i i touched on it very briefly in my

1274
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,680
introductory remarks and i think that

1275
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,400
the how the way the toolbox played out

1276
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,599
on 5g

1277
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,200
boss was very helpful i think that uh

1278
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,200
also the fact that that before that

1279
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,119
the member states actually took

1280
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,800
ownership of it

1281
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
made it helpful as well also

1282
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,119
could be used in other areas i think so

1283
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:53,680
uh

1284
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
if we could be making some more generic

1285
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,000
or technology neutral if i may use

1286
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
that expression i think this was

1287
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,760
something that was

1288
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,319
very well appreciated in sweden with the

1289
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:06,880
with this

1290
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,280
5g toolbox let me also say that we

1291
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,839
rather quickly in sweden adopted new

1292
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,079
national legislation as well in

1293
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,880
regarding to auctioning out on on the 5g

1294
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,359
net as well so we we acted also in the

1295
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,200
concert effort on

1296
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,319
back in sweden i'll stop there yeah and

1297
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,359
then that

1298
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,319
that legislation has been challenged one

1299
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:28,960
might say

1300
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,880
right now so it will be interesting to

1301
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,640
see how that plays out

1302
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,760
uh and on your uh

1303
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,880
answer to this question and indeed i

1304
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
can only repeat i guess what what

1305
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,079
colleagues have said and

1306
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,040
especially supply chain attacks have

1307
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,480
become very frequent

1308
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,400
and uh with the increased relevance also

1309
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,760
those supply chains for uh our strategic

1310
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,640
autonomy

1311
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,560
we really need to step up also in this

1312
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,720
regard and i think that also the nis

1313
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,200
directive the new uh proposal also

1314
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
envisions the possibility for the

1315
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,599
nis corporation group the mechanism that

1316
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,680
really discusses this to conduct

1317
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,920
such coordinated risk assessment of

1318
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,440
critical uh supply

1319
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,800
chains following the approach taking uh

1320
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,480
taken with with 5g uh considering

1321
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,599
all factors in in this

1322
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,480
in this assessments and we really see

1323
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:24,960
this

1324
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,240
uh possibility of conducting such risk

1325
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,359
assessments as

1326
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,119
as an interesting instrument for the

1327
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,480
commission to use

1328
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,559
as well as for member states to use i

1329
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,520
think the 5g

1330
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
toolbox in that regard has been a very

1331
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,280
good achievement and

1332
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
has produced results for the eu where

1333
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,559
member states authorities have pulled

1334
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,839
their expertise

1335
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,319
and have been able to agree on a joint

1336
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,680
analysis of risks

1337
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,280
and this is certainly an instrument that

1338
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,880
member states can look into

1339
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,000
in the future as well uh to really make

1340
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,720
sure that

1341
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,440
uh those critical uh supply chains and

1342
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,319
those critical

1343
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,720
um technologies are protected in that

1344
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,599
regard so

1345
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,839
i i there's really a value in this

1346
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,480
thank you i i can see that we have uh

1347
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,280
quite a few

1348
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,880
questions uh and now they disappeared

1349
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,839
from my

1350
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,079
screen actually um

1351
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,520
from the audience uh so uh

1352
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
i'm going to pick a couple of them where

1353
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,559
we don't have

1354
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,160
all that much time left but uh

1355
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,240
the first one um

1356
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,640
how through through what measures is the

1357
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,440
eeas

1358
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,880
going to organize a common opinion

1359
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,400
of the union regarding how the

1360
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,599
international law applies to cyberspace

1361
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,280
well you've published a common position

1362
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,760
paper and how do you balance between

1363
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,800
differences of member states for example

1364
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
france and germany and and this is very

1365
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,240
much a question to man on

1366
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,680
of course indeed

1367
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,400
well i mean balancing positions of eu

1368
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,319
member states is our daily job

1369
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,480
so that's what we do that's what

1370
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,599
starts off with that so this is not

1371
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,480
necessarily

1372
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,599
uh something in itself which is which is

1373
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,160
new

1374
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,200
but indeed uh the eu is not

1375
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,440
a player as such when it comes to

1376
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,880
international law we are no

1377
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,079
state uh in that regard uh to underline

1378
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:26,559
but

1379
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,400
i think we have an interest in advancing

1380
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,359
uh the understanding of the application

1381
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,680
of international law we also promoted

1382
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,079
this internationally so through these

1383
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,240
discussions among member states

1384
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,599
uh we hope to encourage uh and evolve

1385
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,599
the thinking within the european union

1386
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,280
as well as within member states

1387
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,680
on the application of international law

1388
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
that will not only help us to really

1389
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,599
promote that and promote responsible

1390
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,359
state behavior in cyberspace

1391
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,760
but as well as help us in our diplomatic

1392
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,000
approaches to counter behavior that is

1393
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,599
contrary to that

1394
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,200
and we see that for instance with the

1395
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,640
interpretation that we have on due

1396
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,599
diligence

1397
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,960
since we have established that

1398
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,119
interpretation it is easier for us to

1399
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,119
use also that instrument in

1400
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,240
our diplomatic engagement and there i

1401
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,800
think that

1402
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,160
we have instruments in place we have

1403
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,280
expertise notably within member states

1404
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,040
colleagues who have been working on this

1405
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,640
issue for quite some time who can

1406
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,720
contribute to that we've also had

1407
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
already discussions in council

1408
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,319
in for instance the legal working group

1409
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,319
on this issue and we are also looking

1410
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,920
forward having these discussions among

1411
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,160
member states in the cyber working party

1412
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,119
not necessarily with an aim to go as

1413
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,880
fast as possible towards

1414
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,800
an eu position on the application of

1415
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,000
international law

1416
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,079
but again to stimulate thinking and to

1417
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,119
help also

1418
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,760
evolve the eu and its member states in

1419
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,839
their thinking on how international law

1420
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,359
applies in cyberspace

1421
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,680
as we do promote that also

1422
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,960
internationally

1423
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,280
for instance in our in our contributions

1424
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,800
to the united nations

1425
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,359
open and working group as well as to the

1426
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,280
informal consultations of the gge

1427
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,880
so okay

1428
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,920
thank you for that uh the next question

1429
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,319
is for

1430
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,720
uh evangelist where are the strong and

1431
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,160
where are the weak points

1432
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,240
in cyber defense cooperation across

1433
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,760
countries in europe

1434
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,839
from indonesia point of view then

1435
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,599
yes well

1436
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,920
member states collaborate very nicely

1437
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,280
when it comes you know to

1438
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,839
policy making they have developed the

1439
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,520
culture within us directive

1440
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,400
and also other related policy

1441
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,680
initiatives they have you know the

1442
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,400
council they have you know the

1443
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,559
you know a lot of them have now at

1444
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,720
detached seconded experts you know in

1445
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,760
their embassies

1446
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,599
in brussels and they contribute quite

1447
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,280
nicely on this

1448
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,960
so this ema pino worked quite nicely and

1449
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,240
i see a growing maturity also when it

1450
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,439
comes to cooperation

1451
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,680
on operational matters so there are

1452
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,520
you know islands of cooperation in

1453
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,440
within the union which are stronger than

1454
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,240
others but

1455
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,480
the seizure network is getting also up

1456
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,760
to speed

1457
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,440
and they are sharing more and more and

1458
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,280
the nice cooperation group helped us

1459
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,480
well you know to

1460
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,400
develop this kind of understanding at

1461
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,040
the tactical or strategic level

1462
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,119
so this is getting quite nicely

1463
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,880
of course there is

1464
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,319
still the level of trust is not there

1465
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,440
not with everybody not in all cases

1466
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,880
so we still need to build it up but uh

1467
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,119
judging you know from the last three

1468
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,160
four years with

1469
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,760
5g with nis directive and other

1470
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,800
instruments

1471
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,640
we are getting better but i still

1472
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,839
believe that

1473
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,960
we can do better on operational matters

1474
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,200
especially when it comes to crisis

1475
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,640
that's why you know we are now

1476
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,760
developing cyclone we are developing

1477
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,280
lots of exercises which are

1478
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,400
simulating such kind of phenomena i'm

1479
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,480
not sure that we have the sops the

1480
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,240
standard operating procedures in place

1481
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,520
you know to deal with

1482
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,119
crisis like this in the future

1483
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,359
especially a big crisis

1484
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,240
there we can become better one thing

1485
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,839
that is quite important is the role of

1486
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,839
the private sector i mean at national

1487
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:34,720
level

1488
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,480
public and private sector collaborate

1489
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,160
very nicely

1490
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,359
and however at the european level

1491
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,280
the role of the private sector

1492
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,599
especially big multinationals european

1493
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,200
companies who are active in several

1494
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,400
countries

1495
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,839
i don't know how how well they are

1496
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,319
integrated into the ecosystem

1497
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,880
we as a nation have built up several

1498
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
isaacs information sharing and analysis

1499
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,680
centers

1500
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,800
to collect you know experiences threats

1501
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,680
and so on but

1502
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,800
uh i would definitely like to see a

1503
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,760
better public-private cooperation at the

1504
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,920
eu level as well as well as a national

1505
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,720
level

1506
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,319
and also with the member states having

1507
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,760
an important role

1508
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,000
and the attribution part is getting

1509
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,920
better we have discussed this i'm not

1510
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,680
expert and nissa is not expert on the

1511
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
matter but we we see this

1512
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,240
getting better and i see better efforts

1513
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,160
also on diplomatic

1514
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,119
efforts these are all you know

1515
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,720
interrelated

1516
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,000
aspects that we all have to understand

1517
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,280
and if we become better in one we need

1518
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,040
to become better in others so that

1519
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,760
the end result is is getting better i

1520
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,640
think that

1521
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,079
europe is uh getting a brand

1522
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,319
getting a name you know a reputation for

1523
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,160
a cyber security

1524
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,240
and because of its complexity with so

1525
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,079
many member states

1526
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,680
it is considered as a as a

1527
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,400
as a microcosm of the cyber security

1528
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,079
complexity at global level

1529
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,920
and if they see us managing this

1530
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,119
complexity

1531
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,119
for 27 countries they have big

1532
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,319
reassurances that

1533
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,000
europe can deal with the global

1534
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,319
phenomenon you know and it's global

1535
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,359
players

1536
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,720
and this is this is uh very reassuring i

1537
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,400
think for for the future and uh

1538
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,839
don't forget that the cybersecurity

1539
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,520
strategy is an

1540
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,440
important milestone towards this

1541
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,000
direction

1542
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,599
okay thank you we still have a lot of

1543
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,319
questions

1544
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,599
uh i won't be able to get to them all i

1545
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,040
i want to get to to my my own last

1546
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,319
question

1547
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:47,440
uh before we close and

1548
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,599
i think you will have to give quite

1549
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,520
brief answers to this one so we don't

1550
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,040
run over our time

1551
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,599
uh from what i've heard today uh

1552
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,880
i think you all agree that it's

1553
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,960
important for eu and its member states

1554
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,839
to try advance

1555
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:06,319
responsible state behavior in cyberspace

1556
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,200
what is the single most important thing

1557
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,160
that eu can

1558
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,599
achieve do to achieve that and i would

1559
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,280
like to give that question to paul first

1560
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,960
thank you very much it struck me just if

1561
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,640
i could take one more thing is that we

1562
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,119
talked a lot about the regulation

1563
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,920
but and the eu is quite focused on that

1564
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,520
i know also they're trying to stimulate

1565
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,240
the course

1566
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,920
innovation but i think that's very very

1567
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,760
important for the future for the year

1568
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,280
as well and also to build on the

1569
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,079
strengths that we have such as 5g and

1570
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,559
entering into 6g and devote a lot of

1571
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,440
attention and

1572
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,920
resources to innovation that being said

1573
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,720
how do we

1574
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,760
shape the responsible behavior uh well

1575
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,680
uh may not talk before about the um

1576
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
process i think that's important

1577
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,240
but i don't expect anything to happen

1578
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,280
very rapidly

1579
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,680
as i said also in my introductory

1580
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,680
remarks i think it's very important that

1581
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,480
you work with other liberal democracies

1582
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,119
uh

1583
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,599
and particularly focusing maybe on

1584
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,559
strengthening the transatlantic dialogue

1585
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,040
on these matters as well i think that's

1586
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,680
uh

1587
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,720
there is much much room for improvement

1588
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,280
for us

1589
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,920
creating a stronger common vision of

1590
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,400
establishing a safe and open

1591
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,119
cyberspace

1592
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,799
it's very good evangelist

1593
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,799
yeah look i would suggest you know

1594
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:31,920
europe to stick to

1595
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,960
the basic principles you know so

1596
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,799
use science be factual

1597
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,000
develop solutions based on momentum

1598
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,920
and use its diplomatic you know

1599
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,119
experience you know

1600
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,720
and use the values the european values

1601
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,640
you know as a basis

1602
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,760
to demonstrate to the world that

1603
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,760
we are a very responsible partner and we

1604
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,680
expect from others you know to behave in

1605
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,799
a responsible

1606
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,400
manner thank you thank you and uh

1607
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,359
last out then manon what's what's your

1608
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,240
single most

1609
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,839
important uh thing to do

1610
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,160
single most important thing to do well i

1611
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,359
think we need to

1612
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,000
show responsible behavior we need to

1613
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,640
promote

1614
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,240
responsible behavior and we need to

1615
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,920
enforce it in that sense

1616
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,319
and we do show it really by having this

1617
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,359
strategy and

1618
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,559
and for instance doing all this work on

1619
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,000
uh making sure that we are secure on our

1620
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,400
due diligence obligation in red regard

1621
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,599
we are promoting responsible behavior

1622
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,760
including by also putting forward

1623
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,520
proposals in the united nations to

1624
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,839
really actively work on this work on the

1625
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,119
implementation of

1626
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,640
through for instance the probably a

1627
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,960
program of action that we put forward

1628
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,280
together with 53 other states but we're

1629
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,880
also enforcing it there

1630
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,799
to really show what is responsible

1631
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,640
behavior in cyberspace and what is it

1632
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,520
not

1633
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,480
and to then also use diplomatic measures

1634
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,400
to influence actors towards that

1635
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,079
responsible behavior so

1636
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,160
for me it's not one thing it's three we

1637
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,920
need to show it we need to promote it

1638
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,760
and we need to enforce it

1639
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,520
okay but but showing it by doing the

1640
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,440
right thing i think that's a

1641
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,000
nice last point uh thank you so much

1642
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,640
to the panel for being part of cycon uh

1643
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,319
it's been a real pleasure discussing

1644
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,839
this with you

1645
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,599
and thank you also to the audience for

1646
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,359
your questions i'm sorry we couldn't

1647
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,200
cover them all

1648
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,480
and for your attention and with that i

1649
