good evening i'm excited to be here and

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,679
introduce our panel on disinformation

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,880
we know that disinformation and

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
deception have always been part of

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,680
military operations

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
but recently with the scale and speed of

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
social media pouring an accelerant on an

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,800
already burning flame

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
disinformation has created an underlying

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
existential crisis

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
not but just for militaries but for

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,399
alliances and more broadly the societies

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,320
that form the basis of these alliances

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
this panel will discuss the impact of

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,520
disinformation on these alliances

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,199
on public conceptions of trust and

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,120
military operations as well as to

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440

[Music]

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,159
since the disinformation wars have been

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,520
heating up with governments using

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
disinformation to control their own

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,280
populations as well as so discord abroad

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,799
i'd like each of the panelists to start

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
by telling us what they see as the main

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
challenge of disinformation

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
please tell us a little bit of how you

63
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,520
view the disinformation problem and

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
tell us something unique that we might

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
not have thought about um

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
lydia would you start us off uh yes

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
thank you very much for having me and

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
thank you everyone for being here today

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
um i think the fundamental problem with

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
disinf

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,480
the fundamental challenge with myth and

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
disinformation is actually

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,959
just humanity we've had this problem

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,040
since we i think probably invented

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,160
language

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
if you look back at history you know the

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
salem witch trials that was

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
missing disinformation issue the fact

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
that iceland and greenland are named as

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
they are was an effort to get people

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
you know to keep one keep people from

82
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
going one and

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
going from one going to the other the

84
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
fact that we think that

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
napoleon was short he was actually five

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
seven that was actually

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
a campaign run a long campaign run

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
to try to discredit him so this has been

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,879
a

90
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,440
component of the human experience the

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
thing that makes it

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
the particular challenge now is our

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
technology

94
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
is the connectivity the fact that

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
those incidents and and the way it used

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,480
to be was

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
little ponds right it was sort of in a

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
village in a region

99
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
um more confined now with our technology

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,080
it can spread worldwide very quickly

101
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,519
and the other challenge with it is that

102
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,480
it

103
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
another component of the human ex

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,920
the factor of human excuse me the

105
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,119
feature of it as a human

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
just a component of humanity is that it

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
is profitable

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
the macedonian kids figure that out

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
pretty early when they were creating

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,360
their

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
uh articles just to make

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
just to get clicks the the interesting

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,159
miss and disinformation were the ones

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
that were profitable that that you know

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,720
the

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
they used to say that a lie gets around

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,920
the world before the truth gets their

118
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
boots on

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
but now it's the you know the lie does

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
three laps and becomes a conspiracy

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,159
theory before boot

122
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
you know truth has even gotten her feet

123
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,000
on the ground so

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
it's humans we've always done this

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
our technology has expanded it it is

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
profitable

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
and now the technology is designed to

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
continue to spread what is profitable

129
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
and unfortunately miss disinformation

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
is right so humans are going to come up

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,479
with this stuff

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,600
the technology helps spread it

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,639
and helps actually corral people

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,240
into it even more so it's a

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
complex challenge of just humans and

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
then we create a technology

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
that really accelerates it the thing

138
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,800
that

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
surprised me when i first started in

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
this space

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,919
was that edward berniers i don't some

142
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,199
people on this

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
conference may know that name if you

144
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
don't it's really interesting to go take

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
a take a look at it

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
he actually was both the father of

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
psyops and of marketing

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
and they run on very similar techniques

149
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
and i'm coming from the marketing world

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
and i learned the techniques through

151
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
marketing

152
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
you know it takes eight to ten touches

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
to move someone's opinion and to move

154
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
them to the action that you want

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
saturate their world with your their

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,759
message figure out what keeps them up at

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,560
3am

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
and message to that and then i

159
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,479
discovered psyops and

160
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
oh gosh they do the same thing and what

161
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,080
happened was

162
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,320
he actually invented these concepts in

163
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
world war one

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,160
and then after the war he needed a job

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,039
so he did

166
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
his book called propaganda which is very

167
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,800
similar to machiavelli's

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
book and that it was a job it was it was

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,880
a resume

170
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
so he was helping american companies

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
understand the value of communicating to

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,759
the masses

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
the messaging that you want and if you

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
look at the

175
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
original large companies of america

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,319
procter

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,440
gamble ge uh general motors they were

178
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,080
all his

179
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
first clients and you can really see the

180
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
effectiveness of it

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
as i took a look at it i realized

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
marketers

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
we have been

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,720
running information operations campaigns

185
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
on the general human population psy

186
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
operas did it

187
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
militarily and meanwhile marketing has

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
been

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
using you know the the whole of humanity

190
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,440
whole society

191
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
as a test you know as the test lab

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
and what happened with social media and

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,800
i'm coming from that world

194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,240
is what ended up happening was a

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
an accelerated test lab where you can do

196
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,759
a b testing

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,280
in a short amount of time and you can

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
find out what worked what didn't work

199
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,280
and you can

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
quickly alter your messaging

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
to make it more effective and what we

202
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,039
ended up having was

203
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
a laboratory to really be able to hone

204
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
and create like ultimate information

205
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,319
weaponry

206
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
and really take how to manipulate

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,919
human perception to the next level so

208
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
i highly recommend studying bernays and

209
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
um starting to study marketing books

210
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,880
because

211
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
the two converge thank you yeah i think

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,160
it

213
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
it's really interesting that you point

214
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,520
out that this is just one giant lab

215
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
right chris wiley says when they were

216
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,440
building

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
some of the foundational work at

218
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,240
cambridge analytica they were trying to

219
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
build you know society in silica right

220
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,599
they wanted to replicate society and

221
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,120
silicon and do testing

222
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
and they realized they didn't have to

223
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
replicate anything they had access

224
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
direct access to

225
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
to everyone you know with all the

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,120
information that we voluntarily offer up

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,039
dana would you uh tell us what you think

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
about like where do you see the main

229
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
issues with with disinformation

230
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
some of the wording you know takes us

231
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
off track in a lot of ways i think you

232
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
know we started off worrying about

233
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,400
misinformation and disinformation and

234
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
this idea

235
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,759
that you know facts were coming out that

236
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
weren't the right facts or that were not

237
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,919
facts that were favorable to

238
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,479
um different groups for whatever reason

239
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,400
and i think when we look in this space

240
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
what we're really seeing more than

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,479
this this question of you know what what

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
is the information that should be out

243
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
there and what are the motives of the

244
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
people behind it

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,199
is this this set of influence operations

246
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
that go much much deeper

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
building on what lydia has said about

248
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,560
the technology and the marketing

249
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
techniques our team has been working on

250
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
really trying to understand the

251
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
mechanisms of what makes some of these

252
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
messages so

253
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
sticky what is it that that really grabs

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,799
on to people

255
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
you know kind of going back to her idea

256
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
what keeps you up at 3 a.m

257
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
and we've been looking at social

258
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,720
narratives as part of what's going on

259
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
in this space so our our whole idea

260
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,279
is that and i guess this would be the

261
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,959
surprising thing that

262
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,320
you know these these pieces of

263
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
information whatever they are whatever

264
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,920
is motivating them

265
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,959
when they're attract when they're

266
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,360
attached to certain kinds of

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
social stories that get at our core

268
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
values um

269
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
have this emotional resonance for us and

270
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
what's been happening in the mis

271
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,839
information and disinformation space is

272
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,480
that

273
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
there's been this huge play on emotions

274
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
through these narratives

275
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
and when it starts to happen it

276
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
threatens our sense of

277
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
identity and it threatens our our sense

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
of tribe

279
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
and so all of a sudden we become very

280
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
emotionally activated and our rational

281
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
minds start to shut off

282
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
and now all of a sudden we're actually

283
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
not talking about

284
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
facts or truth or you know uh persuasion

285
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
in the in the sort of more common ways

286
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
of thinking about it

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
now we're interpreting things through

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,839
the lens of our

289
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,920
sense of what groups we belong to in our

290
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,880
identity

291
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
and so if you think about the way that

292
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
this operates these

293
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
these narratives these social stories

294
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
that you know build on

295
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
big schisms in these different societies

296
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
you know certainly in the american

297
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
context the the narratives that are

298
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,200
being used effectively will look a

299
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
little bit different than they would

300
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
in in another country um and yet the

301
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
mechanism we believe is the same

302
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
that you take a gov narrative for

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
example in america of government

304
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
betrayal

305
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
which came out for some groups of the

306
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
civil rights movement and for others

307
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
came out of vietnam

308
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,160
those things come together and you start

309
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
to then layer different things on them

310
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
you know these ideas about a corrupt

311
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
government and now you're talking about

312
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
stolen elections or you're talking about

313
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
a coveted hoax or something else and it

314
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
has so much more power

315
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
because it dives into this very deeply

316
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
held story

317
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
and the other the other piece of this

318
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
is that once that happens not only can

319
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
you use these narratives to start to

320
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
pull people into conversations

321
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
or even to twist the narratives to turn

322
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
them against certain groups defining who

323
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
the in groups and the out groups are

324
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
but you can also use them to draw the

325
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
boundaries around groups

326
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
so if you take different social

327
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
divisions that were already

328
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,720
lurking underneath the the surface these

329
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
narratives gives you

330
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
give you a chance to call them up to

331
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
maybe redraw them or reinforce them

332
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
and to make the group feel both you know

333
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
collectively identified solid with each

334
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
other

335
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
but then also a sense of threat from

336
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,399
outside

337
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,760
and in the misinformation and

338
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
disinformation space what becomes so

339
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
complicated then is when you want to

340
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
counter the information that's out there

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
that isn't in line with the

342
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,320
the agenda and if you go into a counter

343
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,079
narrative in some ways you end up making

344
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
the groups dig in their heels

345
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
because it doesn't matter whether what

346
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
you're saying is truth or not

347
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
you're all of a sudden hitting this

348
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
boundary that's there

349
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
so you know to to think about these in

350
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
different ways when we want to think

351
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
about alliances or we want to think

352
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,240
about how do we

353
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
deal with polarization some of it is

354
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
really getting on top of these

355
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
narratives and using them to draw these

356
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
larger boundaries around us and them

357
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
dana that was really really insightful

358
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,920
in terms of thinking about you know

359
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,519
how you built off of what lydia said

360
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
about the marketing and how basically

361
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
we're using disinformation marketing to

362
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
to build these these tribal boundaries

363
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,079
in a lot of ways

364
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,560
um and to weaponize a lot of what the

365
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
the sort of more banal things that lydia

366
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
was talking about

367
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
giannis your take on this

368
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
well um i think first and foremost i

369
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,000
agree

370
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,440
with with both previous speakers

371
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
but i'll probably have a slightly

372
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,200
different angle to to the issue

373
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
and first and foremost from a social

374
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,560
perspective

375
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
democracy is an intricate process it

376
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
takes

377
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
a lot of elements to fall together to to

378
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,480
make sure that we have a functioning

379
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,079
democracy

380
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
and it happens that the information

381
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,639
space is basically the central element

382
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
of of that process because that's where

383
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,079
we

384
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,760
build our perceptions that's where we

385
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,959
create our world views that's where we

386
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,959
create consensuses and as we speak

387
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,680
we are undergoing the revolution in that

388
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,480
information

389
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,079
space namely through social media

390
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
through online digital engagement and

391
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
etc

392
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,079
and in my view what is has happened

393
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,360
in that process of revolutionary

394
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,120
revolutionization sorry

395
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
of this is that we've lost a lot of

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
elements

397
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
that make the process of

398
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
societal uh debate

399
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,839
uh societal discussion healthy

400
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,560
because unlike the traditional media

401
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,600
space which has

402
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
uh checks and balances and regulation i

403
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,880
would argue

404
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,519
this new space doesn't have none of that

405
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,199
and in a way we're very much at the

406
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,000
mercy of

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
the many of the social media business

408
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
models which prioritize obviously

409
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
engagement and emotions rather than

410
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,880
fact-based

411
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,399
approach but also they really don't look

412
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,360
at the

413
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
how much they would be spending on

414
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
dealing with the hostile

415
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
uh activities on their platforms and you

416
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
know it was all due respect to the

417
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
uh platforms activity in the online

418
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,839
environment and great declarations

419
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
of how they're dealing with the

420
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,959
uh hostile influence campaigns our

421
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,560
research points to the

422
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
to the fact that much more needs to be

423
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,079
done than

424
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,639
currently that's first thing second

425
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
thing obviously yes human has always

426
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
been tolerable and we've always had

427
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,600
these

428
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
uh biases and it has been hard for us to

429
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,320
to create an

430
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
objective point of view or objective

431
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
worldview

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
and uh that was kind of over the

433
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,959
uh decades and centuries where where we

434
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,160
were

435
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
evolving in our social systems we tried

436
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,199
to kind of

437
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
make people more more rational

438
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
more little enlightenment type

439
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
people but what we have right now

440
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,760
with the increased use of technology is

441
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,639
that

442
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,560
technology is actually quite good at

443
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
tricking people in their biases

444
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
into certain beliefs and that is what

445
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:14,880
i'm

446
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
i'm really worried about down the road

447
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,399
is that this equation of human

448
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,720
biases versus the the technological

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
development

450
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
and the the way technology can

451
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
i would say manipulate based on these uh

452
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
elements human behavior

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
is something we have to worry down the

454
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
road but within that landscape what i

455
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,519
would argue

456
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
it's it's basically a dream landscape

457
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,320
for the

458
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,240
disinformation actors be it

459
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,279
for profit be it

460
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,480
um different interest groups that i'm

461
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
are ready to divert to disinformation as

462
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,480
their

463
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
means of getting influence or ultimately

464
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,279
the state actors

465
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,759
and that's why i think this combination

466
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
of do two factors

467
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,600
the revolution of the information space

468
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,440
we're facing and the issues because of

469
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
that within our societies

470
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
and the exploitation of these

471
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
vulnerabilities by hostile actors

472
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
is the kind of reason why

473
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,040
we are in a situation like we are and

474
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,199
sometimes it's hard to sell

475
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
where the kind of objective element of a

476
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,440
new reality ends

477
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
and where the activity of a hostile

478
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
actor starts and sometimes

479
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
they're hostile actors in particular

480
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,160
trying to really kind of

481
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
hide themselves into the normal into

482
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
what we would call a

483
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,560
social and societal processes that are

484
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,519
happening

485
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,880
within this new information space

486
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,399
so i think you bring up a really really

487
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,480
good point um particularly with related

488
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,519
related there's a couple of things that

489
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,040
i want to come back to on that but

490
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
particularly where you talk about you

491
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
know these these hostile actors hiding

492
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,880
inside of the societal processes

493
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
um one of the things that that dana and

494
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
i have found as we were working on some

495
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
um some of the russian disinformation

496
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
was the way that they very much

497
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
pretended to be actors

498
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
on the right and on the left in in the

499
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
american social media space

500
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
um dana did you want to say a little bit

501
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
more about how they used deception

502
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
to kind of help us tell stories that

503
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
drove us further apart

504
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,520
sure yeah so in the

505
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
i mean the russians are really masters

506
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
at this in a lot of ways you know coming

507
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
at this out of

508
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
the soviet manipulative uh context and

509
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,039
then bringing them

510
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
to to social media and so when we

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
started to look at narratives we found

512
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,640
that there was

513
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
a lot that they were doing there both in

514
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,679
terms of

515
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,280
how they were telling stories but then

516
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
also in terms of how they were

517
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,679
pretending to be certain kinds of

518
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,880
storytellers

519
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
so i'll just use the example of the

520
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,320
military for this because i know that's

521
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
one of the topics that we're interested

522
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,120
in on this panel

523
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,240
but uh if you look at the

524
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
the words that they used in their posts

525
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,679
and their profiles

526
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
uh the russians in their in their

527
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,120
disinformation campaign

528
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,799
in in or their influence operation

529
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
campaign rather on twitter

530
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,200
um in english had 12.9 percent of their

531
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
uh tweets and and coming from either

532
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
messages that had military keywords in

533
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,600
them

534
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,400
or came from profiles that had military

535
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
keywords in them

536
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,440
so on the one hand you know when we

537
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
started to look at this you would see

538
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,679
that they would use

539
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,840
narratives related to the military to um

540
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
give more credence to certain things

541
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
that they were saying to

542
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
hide you know as jana said within these

543
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
societal processes

544
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
and and you know give this sense that

545
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
what they were talking about was

546
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
patriotic

547
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
that it was serious that it was

548
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,799
legitimate um and then they would use

549
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
the narratives that were related to the

550
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,240
military to

551
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
um you know smear certain candidates in

552
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
campaigns or to give halos to others

553
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,919
they weaponized them against different

554
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
groups in this case it was

555
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
the muslims the mainstream media

556
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
liberals and

557
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,480
the government itself and on the same on

558
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,240
the other side of it they would have

559
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,640
these

560
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
military profiles and the military

561
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
profiles didn't always use the military

562
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,320
narratives that we saw

563
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
but they were extremely vitriolic for

564
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
twitter and their content

565
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,919
you know twitter's such a mainstream

566
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
platform that people are

567
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,880
even though there's a lot that goes on

568
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
there it's a little bit more um

569
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
tame and polite than when you go into

570
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
the more private chat rooms and the more

571
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,160
um fringe groups and so even there

572
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
you had these these military folks right

573
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
and here we in this country the military

574
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
is one of our most trusted institutions

575
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,240
and you had then seeming representatives

576
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
you know service members and veterans or

577
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
family members of those folks

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,360
again all fake profiles telling us

579
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,000
stories

580
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
that would turn us against certain

581
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
groups and would seem more legitimate

582
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
because they were coming from these

583
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,160
perceived heroes

584
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,799
i think that's a really fascinating idea

585
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,280
to to use the military to weaponize

586
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,440
against elements of of the government

587
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
um lydia to come back to you and to how

588
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
have you seen

589
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
the military be used or the military

590
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
rather struggle in this space

591
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
um that we've been talking about right

592
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,559
because the the the militaries of the

593
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,320
west are um

594
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
part and parcel of of democracy as as as

595
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
janus pointed out right and this is a

596
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
complicated process that the military is

597
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
a part of

598
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,280
in some ways where have you seen the

599
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
military um really struggle in this

600
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760
space

601
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,799
so for the us military one of the

602
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,840
biggest struggles

603
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,039
is that despite what a lot of twitter

604
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
accounts might be trying to say we

605
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
actually

606
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,360
do have very strong

607
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
respect and for the boundaries of we do

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
not look at u.s persons we do not

609
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,080
analyze their we don't engage and look

610
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,480
at

611
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,960
u.s persons social media or anything

612
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,919
like that

613
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,159
and the adversaries know that and they

614
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
are in there and they are pretending to

615
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,880
be us

616
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,960
um and so it's it's a real challenge for

617
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,600
us

618
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,400
that we have we can't look at ourselves

619
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
in this way because those russian

620
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
and those those other adversarial

621
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
accounts are mixed in with

622
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
with real americans so it

623
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
it they know that that's a seam right

624
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
they know that that's a spot that we

625
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,039
can't look

626
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
and so they jump right in there we have

627
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
the other challenge too

628
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
you know general nakasoni ended up

629
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
creating an official twitter account

630
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,360
because there were so many fake accounts

631
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
out there pretending to be him

632
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,960
not just from uh state actors but from

633
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
other

634
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
you know other opportunistic actors so

635
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
it it

636
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,400
imitation accounts targeting

637
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
us military personnel it

638
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,679
that's one of our biggest challenges i

639
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
think is is is

640
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,679
that we are limited on how we can

641
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,280
look at ourselves

642
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
and we know that they're in there and

643
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
they we know that they're doing it

644
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
um and we know that they're targeting

645
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
and they're trying to

646
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
turn like the example right they're

647
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,440
trying to actually turn

648
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,159
u.s military personnel to not trust the

649
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,320
military to not trust the government

650
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,559
and if they can succeed in that that

651
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
that will definitely be

652
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,760
a large problem for for us so i think

653
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
yeah i think those are the two the main

654
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,000
ones at this point

655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,240
thanks giannis i think when when so when

656
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
we when we listen to what lydia

657
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,280
and and dana have have talked about in

658
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
terms of these stories right

659
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
and and as you've pointed out we've

660
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
we've spent the last you know

661
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
500 years or so trying to be more

662
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
rational and trying to you know

663
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,400
participate in this thing called the

664
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,360
enlightenment

665
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
in many ways it almost feels like we're

666
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
moving into a digital dark age

667
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
um what are some of the the things that

668
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,159
that you've seen that give you

669
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,679
hope in this space right so you're

670
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
obviously looking at this from from a

671
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
conglomerate of nations right

672
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
as part of the nato alliances where do

673
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
you see that that we've got some some

674
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
signs of hope that we're starting to get

675
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,559
our arms around this problem set and

676
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
and we're starting to to really start um

677
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,240
leading better in this space and being

678
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,799
more effective

679
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
um i think yes there is

680
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
hope but uh

681
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,159
um temperate hope let's put it this way

682
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
so um in the way we see it of course

683
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,600
there are two areas where nations start

684
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,799
to really invest is

685
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,159
the resilience of society uh

686
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,400
also pointing to the resilience of a

687
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
military but but certainly you cannot in

688
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
this particular

689
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,520
case kind of put military out of the

690
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
general society resilience both have to

691
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
be resilient that's one part

692
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,720
and second i think there's an increased

693
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,440
uh

694
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,400
understanding that the way we are

695
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
running our own information space

696
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,080
the way we're uh asking uh

697
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
what we are asking from social media uh

698
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,440
companies

699
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
is not sufficient and there needs to be

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,559
more

701
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
of a kind of regulatory framework wait

702
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,080
by the way they hold the keys to our

703
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,520
agora of democratic process and in

704
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
as one of the key principles of

705
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
democracy the ones who have power have

706
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,279
to have some

707
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,760
transparency accountability

708
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
and oversight and that's something also

709
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,279
that i i see

710
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,679
both in the eu but i'm increasingly

711
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
hearing also from united states there's

712
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,240
an

713
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
increased interest in that but i'm

714
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
worried

715
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
i'm worried because right now we're

716
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,039
trying to fix

717
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,480
the problem that we're having right now

718
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
the problem that we had yesterday and as

719
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,159
we all know

720
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,600
technology is moving fast really and for

721
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
instance one thing uh

722
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
we two years ago run an experiment uh it

723
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,720
was a

724
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,600
latin forces where we were the so-called

725
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,039
red team

726
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
well the the the concept was we had to

727
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
identify only in the online environment

728
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
who are participating soldiers scraped

729
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,360
for open source

730
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
big data on them and then based on that

731
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,440
big data trying to impact their

732
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
behaviors

733
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,960
and we ended up being able to

734
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,840
make soldiers disobey orders uh make

735
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,480
them

736
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
you know reveal their positions within

737
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,159
the exercise

738
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
scenarios etc etc

739
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,279
um and that is actually in my mind

740
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
pointing to the future problems it's not

741
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
only kind of individual tata that was

742
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,120
was with some some troll or imposter

743
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,039
from russia or iran

744
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,880
that soldiers will be encountering but

745
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
increasingly that would be

746
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,039
automated systems and i think also the

747
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,919
the the risks coming from

748
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,559
the big data we're admitting is is is

749
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
significant especially if you combine it

750
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,720
with a micro targeting

751
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
uh not from a for a political purpose or

752
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,640
from a political standpoint but from a

753
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
hostile influence perspective

754
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
and there will be many other issues that

755
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,400
i think technology is about to bring

756
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,679
to our table deep fakes and etc etc

757
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,200
that will once again test our limits

758
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,000
of uh of our capability to respond

759
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
i'm really glad to hear you bring up the

760
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
micro targeting and the big data problem

761
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
that's something that

762
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
that i know that lydia and dana and i

763
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
have all been really working hard to get

764
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
the us military to take seriously as

765
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
a national security threat um when we

766
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,559
think about

767
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
um you know a lot of the things that

768
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
have come up here really are are getting

769
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,559
at

770
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,159
the profit model the underlying profit

771
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,799
model of these social media companies

772
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,799
um does anyone think and i want to leave

773
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,480
this one kind of open to whoever would

774
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,240
like to jump in does anybody think that

775
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
reining in the profit model um would

776
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,840
would help in this space if we were to

777
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,159
disincentivize

778
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,600
the profit being made from the

779
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
disinformation space if we were to

780
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,600
disincentivize the rapid spread of ideas

781
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,640
like we're seeing

782
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,400
would would changing the profit model

783
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,600
and the profit calculus for these

784
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,199
companies have an impact there

785
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
i can i can hit it a different i have a

786
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,880
different angle on this

787
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,640
but so not only are the social media

788
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
companies profiting but there's a whole

789
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
gig economy of influence

790
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
so you know if you're an influencer

791
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
sometimes it's about the status and the

792
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,279
prestige but

793
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
a lot more of it is about the

794
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
merchandise the clicks

795
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,120
the views the advertising capabilities

796
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,240
and so

797
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,279
you know part and parcel with the the

798
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
money motives that are out there for the

799
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,039
social media companies to

800
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,279
uh propagate these messages to make

801
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,640
their platforms

802
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
places where the data can be used and

803
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,559
where the algorithms can

804
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,760
can push certain things you know

805
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
especially from a marketing perspective

806
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,640
if you think about these influence

807
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
operations as a marketing exercise

808
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
that's still there but then you also

809
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
have an army of

810
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
um individuals sometimes networked ones

811
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
sometimes working solo

812
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,600
who are also benefiting in a variety of

813
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,399
social and economic ways from you know

814
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,520
spreading these

815
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
these engaging messages oftentimes the

816
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,039
ones that

817
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,279
create outrage and and upset

818
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,399
i think that's a really really good

819
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
point of all of the different folks that

820
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,679
that are benefiting from this this

821
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,360
current model

822
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
did someone else want to jump in on that

823
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,799
yeah this is

824
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,640
sort of i'm going to go ahead a little

825
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
bit to where

826
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,320
what how to try to solve this um

827
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
right it makes money if it makes money

828
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,360
people are going to do it

829
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
and you know remember from the early

830
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,919
days of the internet right it was the

831
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
first rule of the internet was

832
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
don't feed the trolls and that's where

833
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,919
we are as we are feeding the trolls and

834
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,600
it's not just the the the nasty little

835
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,679
gamergate comment trolls which is where

836
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,760
that you know started was

837
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,240
but it's all the trolls it's the people

838
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
who are tweeting out

839
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
content whether you know whether they

840
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
believe it or not they're treating it

841
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,480
they're tweeting it out for the response

842
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
and if we could as collectively as

843
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:17,760
humans

844
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,440
stop feeding the trolls stop uh

845
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
responding to that then that would

846
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
that's the way you would

847
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
de incentivize it that's the way you

848
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,399
would take the money out of it that's

849
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,360
the way you would

850
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,159
pull the the profit out how do you get

851
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,679
people to do that i sit there

852
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,640
and i watch these things go and i think

853
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,320
everyone

854
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,360
just remember the first rule

855
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
and i think the way that we get at that

856
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
i think i froze

857
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,399
there you go the way we get at that is

858
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,679
it's going to take grassroots

859
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,919
much more individual engaging with

860
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,880
people more personally

861
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,559
effort if i had not gotten this job the

862
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,760
thing that i would have been out there

863
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,320
doing

864
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
was building my network of influence

865
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,279
ambassadors but not for money

866
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,640
but for teaching

867
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
the miss and disinformation tactics and

868
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,480
what is happening so

869
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
not everybody is going to want to hear

870
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,760
from me about

871
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
how the russians are putting information

872
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,960
into their information stream

873
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
the key is to go find the person from

874
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,399
that tribe

875
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
from that group who will listen and will

876
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
understand and who will go then teach

877
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,320
their tribe

878
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
it's going to much more take

879
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
connecting with people individually you

880
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,200
know putting out snopes and articles

881
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,120
people just they're already inoculized

882
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
against those i think what we need to do

883
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,559
is we need to start figuring out how to

884
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,360
start building the tribes of

885
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,919
miss and disinformation debunkers and

886
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,919
i'll hand it over

887
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,039
giannis yeah well uh first

888
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,080
we we run a system that tracks russian

889
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,279
uh social media

890
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,919
media botnets and over the years and

891
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,880
it's been a year

892
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,799
since we've been doing so so you kind of

893
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,120
start establishing the

894
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,279
who they're uh answering to and the

895
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,320
command control

896
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,279
uh arrangements but what we always find

897
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,080
surprising

898
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,039
that almost all of those systems also

899
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:21,360
run

900
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,399
at a commercial uh enterprise

901
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
that means that 70 to

902
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,480
90 percent of the time they actually

903
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
sell their manipulation

904
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
services to whoever is ready to buy and

905
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,480
i think that's an interesting thought

906
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
that some

907
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,880
russian state actors that are developing

908
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
these systems and fielding them

909
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
in particular to to advance their

910
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,799
interests and harmed ours

911
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,240
and our societies on the side

912
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
make quite a lot of money just by also

913
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,080
selling it

914
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,240
and i think it's it's it's quite a

915
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,279
paradox and

916
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,440
and of course therefore my answer is yes

917
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
we have to deal with that

918
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,519
i also agree with lydia we we have to

919
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,399
look at the

920
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,279
kind of humans being and doing more but

921
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
in this part of the region there's

922
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
actually quite a lot of

923
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,600
kind of activity on a on a societal

924
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
level so called elves

925
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,559
the the groups as uh non-governmental

926
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,320
groups that self-organize to fight

927
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,919
trolls and etc etc

928
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,399
but i have to say after seeing these

929
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,200
phenomenons

930
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,640
for like four or five years it has

931
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
a place but it's limited we

932
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,070
i think have to address wider

933
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,559
[Music]

934
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,880
problems including as i've said

935
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,120
regulation of social media being able to

936
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,000
make sure that

937
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,080
they're doing what they're supposed to

938
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
do to root out for instance these uh you

939
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,919
know authentic

940
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,039
behavior bot systems um

941
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
to spend their

942
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,039
kind of abundant money also in in the

943
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,480
ways to protect the

944
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
consumers that are online uh that's uh

945
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,960
first second uh and which is i think a

946
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,120
fundamental discussion to be had but i

947
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,200
think we're going to have it

948
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,840
who is supposed to own data and i know

949
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
there have been

950
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,960
quite a lot of discussions but coming

951
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,159
from a security

952
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,360
perspective i find that the current

953
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
practice is

954
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,440
not quite good

955
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,080
i understand how it might fundamentally

956
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
change many business models but i think

957
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,519
that is something worth debating

958
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,039
yeah i think you bring up an excellent

959
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,480
excellent point about the the

960
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
fundamental ownership of data right

961
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,320
so in in the united states we have this

962
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
idea of copyright that the minute you

963
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,880
put something into a a physical medium

964
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
you own the rights to it

965
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
when we start thinking about people's

966
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,399
data and all of the ways that that can

967
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,240
be used to manipulate against

968
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
to manipulate individuals right it

969
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,760
really raises a much bigger question

970
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,399
about

971
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,039
the ownership of this who does actually

972
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,799
own this right when we think about

973
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
medical data when we think about mental

974
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,840
health records when we think about

975
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,519
blood types and like all of the folks

976
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,919
that went and did the the blood typing

977
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,079
to get their their genomic history

978
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,879
right like all of that data now are

979
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,639
owned by other companies by private

980
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,320
companies and we know that some of our

981
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,480
adversaries are eagerly either hacking

982
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,719
their way into this or or buying it

983
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,960
and just because it's not a threat now

984
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,239
doesn't mean that it won't necessarily

985
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,119
be a threat in

986
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
in the future um giannis can you say a

987
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
little bit more about what you would

988
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,119
like to see

989
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,520
in terms of regulation in this space

990
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,879
because i think you know i think you're

991
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,719
absolutely right that we can't count on

992
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,320
companies goodwill because

993
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,079
their primary directive is to make a

994
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,239
profit right um and just telling them

995
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,359
hey be good citizens

996
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,359
clearly isn't working so what would you

997
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,960
like to see in terms of regulation and

998
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,560
and then lydia and dana i'd like you to

999
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,599
speak to that too

1000
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,199
as well before that regulation

1001
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,520
just just a short point we just had an

1002
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,359
experimentation on

1003
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,560
uh big data brokers and

1004
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,280
i have to say that you can buy anything

1005
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
you wish for and it's like

1006
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,520
so detailed especially for the u.s

1007
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,000
citizens not covered by gdpr

1008
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,440
and having a large data broker market

1009
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,560
it horrified me at least okay so now

1010
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,920
more about that yeah on the regulatory

1011
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,640
uh

1012
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
points um i do believe the three

1013
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
principles that we have to ask from the

1014
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
social media

1015
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,160
a is a transparency to a regulator on

1016
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,599
algorithms to make sure that they are

1017
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,599
not uh unnecessarily prioritizing

1018
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,560
a b or c things and actually ability to

1019
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,520
go in

1020
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,359
and have an independent uh view of it

1021
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,400
second obviously is that

1022
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
we have to be able to independently

1023
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,440
review their security practices

1024
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,720
as i've said uh we've come a number of

1025
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,280
times

1026
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
in the situations where for instance

1027
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
companies say

1028
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
one thing saying well we're doing a

1029
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
great job to take down so

1030
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,079
so so many uh botnets on their platforms

1031
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,480
and then we when we run an experiment we

1032
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,320
go to those uh

1033
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,599
shady dealers uh buy their services and

1034
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,040
and and try it out on on our

1035
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
our own accounts in facebook and see

1036
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
well

1037
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
it's cheap easily accessible you

1038
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
basically google search for the provider

1039
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
and you get it

1040
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,520
um so there's there's really kind of

1041
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,119
need to have an

1042
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,480
independent ability to check and if it's

1043
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,079
not providing

1044
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,079
have a good hefty uh

1045
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,200
penalty and ultimately as i've said in

1046
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,160
my view

1047
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,359
also the the data ownership issue has to

1048
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:45,680
be

1049
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,599
uh reviewed because it leads i think

1050
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,720
down the road to

1051
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
very very significant problems and of

1052
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,400
course we're right now

1053
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,760
uh talking of the world where

1054
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,400
most of that is a western product

1055
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
companies but as we know

1056
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,520
increasingly chinese products like

1057
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,880
wechat tick tock are coming in and then

1058
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,680
on the back end there's a chinese social

1059
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,280
uh social credit system

1060
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,839
model somewhere running probably some

1061
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,839
certain things so

1062
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,079
it's i think absolutely last moment we

1063
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,040
start to talk about it

1064
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
i think you you bring up absolutely

1065
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
excellent points and i agree with with

1066
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
all three of your regulatory proposals

1067
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
dana what would you propose

1068
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,560
i mean i think the only thing that i

1069
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,240
would add to that is this

1070
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,440
idea of a right to privacy that you know

1071
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,079
right now

1072
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,680
all of our information is seen as a

1073
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,240
commodity rather than as something that

1074
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,760
is integrally part of our identities and

1075
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,440
that you know we have a right to keep

1076
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,320
private

1077
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,079
and with all of the information that's

1078
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,440
out there already as you've already

1079
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,240
noted

1080
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,400
there's already a significant risk to

1081
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
anybody who's engaged with these systems

1082
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
you know even the credit card companies

1083
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,599
have data on

1084
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,800
in the us 98 of our households so

1085
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
even putting the genie back in the

1086
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,920
bottle i think is going to be a very

1087
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,280
difficult thing and it's going to take

1088
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
some sustained work over

1089
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
you know quite a period of time to

1090
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
really prioritize this idea that

1091
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,079
we do have the the rights to take our

1092
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,880
information

1093
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
to to be private about it and to not

1094
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,920
have it be sold for profit

1095
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,200
i think that's that's an excellent

1096
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,720
excellent point chris wiley makes an

1097
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,480
outstanding point about privacy

1098
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,240
you know being fundamentally related to

1099
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,839
to human agency in his

1100
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,520
in his book um that i don't want to say

1101
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,200
the title in polite company but

1102
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
it's an absolutely excellent book mind f

1103
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,280
um lydia what would you recommend in

1104
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
terms of of

1105
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,560
uh regulatory oversight

1106
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
i agree with all of this and then i

1107
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
would say that the sites need to come

1108
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,520
with a warning label like cigarettes

1109
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,119
so the next part is when when

1110
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,640
came from the analytica broke i was

1111
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,680
really excited because i've been

1112
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,480
tracking that

1113
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
and and i've been the crazy person on

1114
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,280
facebook saying stop taking these

1115
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
quizzes you're giving right

1116
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
and i was excited because i thought

1117
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
it was going to be explained and people

1118
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,839
would understand and what people took

1119
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,480
away from that in my world

1120
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,119
was facebook is collecting data on me

1121
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,680
but

1122
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
you know and they they i'm excited that

1123
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,599
at that point people in my world

1124
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,520
got the concept of if you're not paying

1125
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,880
you're the product which a lot of

1126
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,359
people seem to have also forgotten now i

1127
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,800
think that there needs to be more

1128
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,839
warnings

1129
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,599
throughout the the tools throughout the

1130
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,640
the sites

1131
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
of do you like the cigarette warnings

1132
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,160
that's what i would say let's get some

1133
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,520
let's get some warnings on there so

1134
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,359
people can start to think

1135
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,400
and realize

1136
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
the the tools that they're using and

1137
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
what it is doing along

1138
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,119
the way i think those are all really

1139
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,720
really excellent recommendations across

1140
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,960
the board i would add two if i may be so

1141
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,119
so bold as to jump in one i would like

1142
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,280
to see universities change their irb

1143
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,160
rules to

1144
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,400
enable research using all of this data

1145
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
that are out there

1146
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,599
right now a lot of the universities will

1147
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
push back on projects because it's

1148
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,800
people's data that they didn't

1149
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
necessarily consent to

1150
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
being collected and yet research

1151
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,599
universities they're some of the only

1152
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,839
folks that have the the capability

1153
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,480
to provide some of the the oversight and

1154
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,400
the investigation of how these tools are

1155
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
working

1156
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
um and the other thing that i would

1157
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,079
propose is advertiser registration

1158
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,760
right so right now anybody with a credit

1159
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,680
card can can log on to any of these

1160
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,119
platforms and start buying

1161
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,240
advertisements

1162
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,040
um if we were to to require advertisers

1163
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,599
to get

1164
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
you know to register with with a

1165
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,800
government agency like the you know here

1166
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
in the united states the federal you

1167
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,440
know the ftc the federal trade

1168
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,480
commission

1169
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,520
um then these platforms would know that

1170
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
the person that was advertising

1171
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
was a known entity as opposed to an

1172
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,480
unknown entity

1173
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
um i don't think the the the social

1174
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,800
media platforms will ever go for that

1175
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,240
but i think it would be a really

1176
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,319
interesting way of of splitting the the

1177
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,839
difference in terms of still allowing

1178
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,680
advertising but providing some

1179
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,440
some regulatory oversight there um

1180
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,240
i want to come back to um one more point

1181
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,680
that we were kind of talking about and

1182
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,280
draw the lens up a little bit higher in

1183
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
terms of alliances

1184
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
right we've really talked about

1185
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,839
democracy and we've really talked about

1186
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,359
the stories that get told inside of

1187
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,240
society

1188
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,640
and and the profit model here where do

1189
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,280
we see

1190
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,560
the challenge of of of alliances

1191
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,200
and and being able to to maintain you

1192
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
know this this thing called democracy

1193
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,359
requires trust it requires knowing that

1194
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,040
the person working in your government is

1195
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,839
actually

1196
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,440
working you know somebody that you know

1197
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
in the and that they're you know you

1198
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,079
assume that they're doing the right

1199
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,560
thing in in the american narratives the

1200
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,920
stabbed in the back narratives right

1201
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,400
it's this

1202
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
is very anti-semitic conspiracy that the

1203
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,079
government has been taken over

1204
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,240
and it's working to enslave the american

1205
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,280
people right

1206
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,200
um so you can't have a democracy if you

1207
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,720
don't believe that your government is

1208
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
is part of the the democratic process so

1209
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,680
when we think about alliances and we

1210
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,240
think about

1211
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,760
democracy more broadly how do we see um

1212
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,599
alliances coming together to influence

1213
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,599
this because right now the regulatory

1214
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,240
process

1215
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,960
is sort of state by state in many ways

1216
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,359
um

1217
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,240
or in america and um i know the eu has a

1218
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
little bit more of a collective effort

1219
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,119
here but where do we see

1220
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,359
you know nato really working with with

1221
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
the alliance factor to try

1222
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,240
and and and combat this um so giannis if

1223
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
you could start us there

1224
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,839
well uh clearly from a nato's

1225
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,839
perspective we're we're looking at the

1226
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,079
security implications for that and and

1227
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,920
and the security

1228
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
implications are pretty wide we're

1229
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,200
talking not only of

1230
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,160
military or military operations we're

1231
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,720
talking about the society implications

1232
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,319
you might be having an excellent

1233
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,319
military operation but you might be

1234
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,839
targeted

1235
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,560
by the hostile actor within your home

1236
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,520
country and

1237
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,599
ruin all the success of a military

1238
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,920
operation and it is very likely scenario

1239
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
that we might have

1240
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,079
in the near future so i think it's first

1241
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,520
and foremost

1242
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,839
the the kind of from nato's perspective

1243
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,119
to raise the

1244
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,160
security perspective the urgency but

1245
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,839
clearly nato doesn't have

1246
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,680
the uh many tools to work

1247
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,960
with that although one say thing that

1248
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,079
we've learned in our

1249
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,200
center is that you have to show real

1250
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,720
life examples that people can relate to

1251
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,400
and for instance this experiment that we

1252
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
run with the soldiers

1253
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,119
it's news about that spreading in the

1254
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,920
forces like a wildfire and you know

1255
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,400
soldiers almost like drop their phones

1256
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,000
because of that

1257
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,520
um so it is through example that nato

1258
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,160
can

1259
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,839
can give these guidances but by and

1260
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,440
large i think there are

1261
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,520
basically two entities that can do

1262
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
something about it at this point in time

1263
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,160
it's either eu or united states

1264
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,280
as a country and the best if we can

1265
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,079
be done uh more or less jointly because

1266
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,880
that's where

1267
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,720
we can set the key parameters how

1268
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,280
this should function in a modern 21st

1269
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,599
century democracy and keep the freedoms

1270
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,079
and

1271
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,079
values uh but not allow this

1272
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,200
disinformation and fracturing of a

1273
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
society

1274
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,440
as we're seeing right now so that's

1275
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,520
where i see that alliance and we as a

1276
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,720
center have been

1277
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,800
continuously talking both to eu

1278
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
parliament as well as u.s senate on

1279
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
these issues to

1280
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,400
to just raise the the the flag of

1281
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,359
of the risks we're running if we're not

1282
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,800
fixing it

1283
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,640
today i think that's a really really

1284
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,680
really great point

1285
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,480
um lydia

1286
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
i mean i think one of our biggest

1287
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
obstacles right now

1288
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,319
is political will because the the

1289
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,560
the purveyors of the miss and

1290
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
disinformation have done such a fabulous

1291
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,599
job

1292
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,119
of creating ways to undermine this

1293
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
um when giannis was talking before he

1294
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,040
was talking about how

1295
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
the debate and discussion have been

1296
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,599
undermined in in our world now

1297
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,440
and if you look at it right if someone

1298
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,520
comes in with a differing opinion or or

1299
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:11,920
if

1300
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,359
if someone suffers the consequences for

1301
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,599
saying outrageous things you know they

1302
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,160
they cry cancel culture i'm cancelled

1303
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,799
so i i think it's

1304
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
we need we need our leaders to be brave

1305
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
and take the risk

1306
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,280
and and be ready to you know take the

1307
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
the troll and and the real person

1308
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,560
onslaught

1309
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,839
and and dare to to make do this alliance

1310
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,319
and do this work

1311
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,359
it's going to be a hard fight because

1312
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,119
those that are trying to keep that from

1313
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,119
happening have actually already built up

1314
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,319
a really effective

1315
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,760
system as far as ideas and language and

1316
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
being able to wrote people in to

1317
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,359
undermine it

1318
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,880
yeah i think you're you're absolutely

1319
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,720
right about that um in

1320
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,079
in in a lot of different ways and it's

1321
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,359
it's quite disheartening because we're

1322
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,040
sort of trying to push the snowball you

1323
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,560
know push the avalanche back uphill if

1324
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,440
you will

1325
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,960
dana yeah i don't have a lot to add but

1326
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
i think that the pandemic puts a lot of

1327
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,800
this in perspective as well this need

1328
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,520
for

1329
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,440
getting ahead you know an information

1330
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,720
advantage in the information and

1331
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,480
disinformation space and

1332
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,960
one that really recognizes that while we

1333
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,359
do have our our national boundaries and

1334
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,079
our

1335
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,400
you know uh traditional alliances that a

1336
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
lot of the things that are happening in

1337
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,760
the world really transcend that

1338
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,240
and so it's really imperative that

1339
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,920
different governments work together

1340
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,200
and um you know try to

1341
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,440
to work on what's happening in this

1342
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,400
space

1343
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,640
and so you know if one country regulates

1344
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,079
but the others don't

1345
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,680
we have this sort of whack-a-mole

1346
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,280
problem where we might be able to

1347
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,359
contain something just a little bit

1348
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,480
but our communications are so far beyond

1349
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,240
you know these these these boundaries

1350
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,920
i think that's a really really excellent

1351
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,599
point and and thinking about boundaries

1352
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,720
um we actually have a couple of

1353
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,839
questions from the audience

1354
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,079
um one of them is actually really about

1355
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,680
boundaries about professional standards

1356
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,040
right so it says you know and for a good

1357
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,400
portion of human history you know there

1358
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,000
really hasn't been a professional news

1359
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,160
industry with with editorial standards

1360
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,000
um it really did develop in

1361
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,319
in the the sort of early parts of the

1362
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,440
20th century

1363
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,119
do we think it's realistic for us to

1364
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,599
expect that we can return to a

1365
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:21,920
professionalization

1366
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
um or to any kind of professionalization

1367
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,680
in the the social media space or in the

1368
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
media space more broadly

1369
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,599
um lydia

1370
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,720
um i have a dream uh

1371
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,640
so where we are right now with a lot of

1372
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,000
our media space is right

1373
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
they they've learned i'm off camera here

1374
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,280
they've learned that right

1375
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,040
we're playing gladiator games on our

1376
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,880
evening news right it's the

1377
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,200
fight for the best sound bite um

1378
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,880
the thing that i've seen there's another

1379
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,040
um

1380
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,240
person who does in-depth dives on on

1381
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,599
content and information

1382
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,359
unfortunately he's very biased in a

1383
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,040
certain take and he generally goes

1384
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,119
vulgar so i can't share it a lot

1385
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,800
however i would be surprised i would not

1386
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,559
be surprised if

1387
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,920
news decided to

1388
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,079
try some of these deep dives and go into

1389
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,280
the information i think they would be

1390
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,559
very surprised

1391
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,839
at how hungry people are

1392
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,880
for something besides the sound bites

1393
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,240
i i think that maybe the way we get to

1394
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,200
it is just the natural evolution of

1395
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,119
people are tired they get tired of this

1396
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,480
and they want more um

1397
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,640
in-depth information and and if someone

1398
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,440
would dare to take the risk to do

1399
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,520
well researched in-depth well-produced

1400
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,040
reports i think they would be really

1401
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,480
surprised and

1402
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,359
yeah how do we solve this i think i

1403
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,800
think we're in a cycle

1404
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,359
and i think that we're going to have to

1405
00:48:59,359 --> 00:48:59,839
hit a

1406
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,400
harder rock bottom before we come back

1407
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,200
to our

1408
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,760
age of digital enlightenment it seems

1409
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,000
yeah

1410
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,359
anyone else want to tackle that one we

1411
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,319
have a couple more questions go ahead

1412
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,880
if i may just quickly first of course

1413
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,400
you have to recognize u.s

1414
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,200
space and i would argue also uk spaces

1415
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,400
are particular

1416
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,160
if you look at many other nations there

1417
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
are more central ground in that

1418
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,040
information

1419
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,559
space and still more of a quality

1420
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,760
uh kind of information available but

1421
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,839
what we have in a smaller information

1422
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,960
spaces

1423
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,000
these uh media business models are dying

1424
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,720
out in

1425
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,640
in smaller countries like like latvia

1426
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,400
for instance it's almost dead

1427
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,920
and it's starting to go into other

1428
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,319
bigger language spaces and that is also

1429
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:48,960
because

1430
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,440
most of their revenue ad revenue goes to

1431
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,760
the large social media companies so

1432
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
that's one part of the problem the

1433
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
second of course there's no way to turn

1434
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,720
back

1435
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
but of course you could think of

1436
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,960
theoretical models where

1437
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,079
some of the editorial choices and

1438
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:06,800
decisions

1439
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,240
can be given out to tech

1440
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,760
yeah i mean the the question of

1441
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,599
editorial is really really interesting

1442
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,359
and and tech likes in america they like

1443
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,559
to say that you know they're not they're

1444
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:18,880
not

1445
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,559
content you know editors they're they're

1446
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,559
just platforms but yet with their

1447
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,480
algorithms we know that their their

1448
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,440
algorithms are

1449
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,040
are built to make choices about what

1450
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,480
content that they're going to advance

1451
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,520
versus not

1452
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,839
um so i think that re reframing the idea

1453
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,760
of what does it mean to be a content

1454
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
publisher or editorial

1455
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,119
and looking at the role of algorithms in

1456
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,240
that i think is a really really

1457
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,520
interesting point

1458
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,559
um another question that's come up is um

1459
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,319
is there any we've talked a lot of

1460
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,400
defense here do we have any ideas that

1461
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,079
that folks would like to share about

1462
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,839
offensive tactics that we that we've

1463
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,000
seen maybe work um who is doing

1464
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,319
a good job in some of these spaces um is

1465
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,720
anyone

1466
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,040
well well if i may you go sorry media

1467
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,960
you go

1468
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,000
you go you go first okay okay

1469
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,119
uh well actually uh since uh

1470
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,720
russia is about uh 200 kilometers from

1471
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,760
here

1472
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
uh we've been tracking uh how does it

1473
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,520
work and and what they feel is is the

1474
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,400
risk

1475
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,440
and of course uh most of our uh

1476
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,520
adversaries that are running these uh

1477
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,119
campaigns against us

1478
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,720
are actually doing that because of

1479
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,040
weakness not because of the strengths

1480
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,440
they just have found a particular

1481
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,520
weakness in our own societies but they

1482
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,240
have

1483
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,440
more than that but they have a different

1484
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,079
author

1485
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,040
authoritarian system in essence instead

1486
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,920
of having a

1487
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,160
free flow of information which we in

1488
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,640
democracies cherish and try to

1489
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,359
to to protect they want to control so

1490
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,960
that's what they're trying to do

1491
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,720
so what they especially after 2011

1492
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,160
they've tried to really build the

1493
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,119
systems that

1494
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,119
protect them from outside impacts

1495
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,240
but what we can see right now

1496
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,960
that people within these societies like

1497
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,319
navalny

1498
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,119
like uh the guy who just got arrested

1499
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:13,440
the

1500
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,480
the the one that was running nectar

1501
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,720
um in in uh the belerution guy

1502
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,920
they are the ones that really make it

1503
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,160
really really painful by just very

1504
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,319
simple thing exposing the troops

1505
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,960
so i think that's what we have to do we

1506
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,240
have to support these

1507
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,800
these kind of people that can expose the

1508
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,960
realities to the people back in these

1509
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,200
countries

1510
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,480
yeah i think you bring up a really

1511
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,000
really good point and one of the things

1512
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,480
that

1513
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,240
that i've i've been trying to point out

1514
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,079
to to to military leaders

1515
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,720
is that that what happened to navalny

1516
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,400
can happen to any of us in the in the

1517
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,160
social media space we can all be

1518
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,480
called from the herd so to speak and and

1519
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
segregated away there is no strength in

1520
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,200
numbers

1521
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,160
in in many ways um we've got about five

1522
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,359
minutes left and so

1523
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,359
what i would like to do is to give each

1524
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,480
of you you know a couple minutes to kind

1525
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,440
of sum up and

1526
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,520
give us one main takeaway that you would

1527
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,480
like like the

1528
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,720
the conference attendees to uh to to

1529
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,160
kind of remember as they take away from

1530
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,480
this

1531
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,599
and then do you have a book

1532
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,440
recommendation so what is one thing that

1533
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,720
you would recommend that

1534
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,720
that people read to get to get you know

1535
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,640
deeper into to what's going on dana if

1536
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,040
you would start us off

1537
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,880
yeah so on the book recommendation i

1538
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,400
would i would recommend the chris wiley

1539
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,119
book that you

1540
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,480
mentioned earlier um that is the sort of

1541
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,160
one of the whistleblower stories out of

1542
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,520
the cambridge analytica

1543
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,720
uh scandal and really goes into detail

1544
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,880
about how a lot of the micro targeting

1545
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,000
works in

1546
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,400
in a way that i think makes it really

1547
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,079
accessible

1548
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,119
um in terms of takeaways i think one of

1549
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,319
the things that's been really

1550
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,440
disheartening to learn

1551
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,599
over the course of of these studies is

1552
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,520
just how far behind we are in a lot of

1553
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,280
ways and the genie is already out of the

1554
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,319
bottle

1555
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,880
and so instead of trying to find ways to

1556
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,640
put the genie back in the bottle

1557
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,880
i think we need to start coming up with

1558
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,240
other paradigms for

1559
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,640
for what to do going forward and one of

1560
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,160
the big things that we've seen coming

1561
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,520
out of all of this is just

1562
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,240
how how there were these underlying

1563
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,760
vulnerabilities and rifts in our

1564
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,800
societies

1565
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,960
that were just right for exploitation so

1566
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,720
that you know the world is becoming more

1567
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,160
and more polarized

1568
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,000
and our own communities are becoming

1569
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,440
more and more polarized

1570
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,119
being involved with the pandemic and

1571
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,720
being stuck at home and

1572
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,000
you know relating to people through

1573
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,079
social media has allowed for

1574
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,040
us to find these echo chambers and these

1575
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,760
these

1576
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
thought bubbles of being with people who

1577
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,440
think the same way that we do and it's

1578
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,839
amplified a lot of these divisions

1579
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,680
hopefully as things start to open up and

1580
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
we're doing a little bit more offline

1581
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,040
we'll be able to start moving more

1582
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,359
toward cohesion and yet at the same time

1583
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,960
there's a lot of damage that's already

1584
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,839
been done

1585
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,880
and so part of the the the

1586
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,559
solution to these problems in the

1587
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,480
disinformation and misinformation space

1588
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,920
really have to do with building social

1589
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,079
resilience

1590
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,599
great points lydia um

1591
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,720
the book i recommend is the brand gap

1592
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,960
by marty neumeyer coming from the

1593
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,319
marketing background

1594
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,240
it it comes back to explaining the

1595
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,319
tribes that dana was talking about

1596
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,079
earlier and and

1597
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,079
we we figured that out a long time ago

1598
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,760
with the marketing and and this

1599
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,079
is the the challenges we're being

1600
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,680
divided into tribes

1601
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,799
the irony is the faster we build up we

1602
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,119
break down the walls of the internet

1603
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,119
and and create more connectivity the

1604
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,200
quicker we are building up our own

1605
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,960
tribes on the internet and building up

1606
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,680
our walls

1607
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,920
on the internet the thing that i wish

1608
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,599
everybody would take away from this is

1609
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,520
if you're not first you're last to quote

1610
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,720
ricky bobby

1611
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,440
from child negan

1612
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,480
and the the challenge is is the russians

1613
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,680
are out there they're out there running

1614
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,359
the narrative in marketing

1615
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,119
in ideas the first to market the loudest

1616
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,000
the most consistent that's what gets

1617
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,119
internalized

1618
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,280
i don't feel like we are in there

1619
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,880
putting our messages

1620
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,680
out consistently and loudly enough and

1621
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,040
we don't have to counter theirs

1622
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,680
we have to say what ours are and onto

1623
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,960
you

1624
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,079
giannis please close us out uh

1625
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,400
well for the military out there i would

1626
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,640
recommend

1627
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,440
being biased our own report from nato

1628
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,880
stratform coe

1629
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,960
camouflage in the digital domain which

1630
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,119
is providing some tips

1631
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,280
what can be done for the military to to

1632
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,200
avoid being tracked

1633
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,160
in the online environment which might

1634
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,839
provide some helpful um

1635
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,040
advice on the uh big picture

1636
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,079
uh i think there's no time to waste

1637
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,880
we are running out of time to fix these

1638
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,760
things because

1639
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,200
uh as we feel all the system

1640
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,960
we are having in our countries is

1641
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,079
starting to wear down

1642
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,720
but we have also to be mindful that this

1643
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,960
is not going to be the end of it

1644
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,319
the technology is coming with a new uh

1645
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,599
new things and to me in this

1646
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,480
digital disinformation domain i in

1647
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,680
particular would point to the

1648
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,119
5g enabled emergence of

1649
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,599
internet of things that is coupled with

1650
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:22,480
the

1651
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,960
increased spread of augmented reality

1652
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,079
devices which

1653
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,160
in fact will uh couple the the reality

1654
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,319
and digital reality which i think will

1655
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,359
have

1656
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,200
a very new wave of vulnerabilities

1657
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,240
risks as well as attacks on the human

1658
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,400
cognitive space

1659
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,599
and second a

1660
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,640
point of hope um

1661
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,240
one thing that is great about the

1662
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,799
democracies we might be making bad

1663
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,640
choices we might

1664
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,280
probably do mistakes but it is the only

1665
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,520
self-correcting system we have so i'm

1666
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,640
looking forward

1667
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,720
to the self-correction that we're going

1668
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,359
to do all together

1669
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,119
i think that thank you for for leaving

1670
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,720
us with with an element of hope i think

1671
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,040
we

1672
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,680
we do have a a system that is flawed but

1673
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,440
like you said it is self-correcting

1674
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,599
thank you all um panelists for for

1675
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,520
putting putting the time in to conduct

1676
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,160
this panel

1677
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,599
i hope the audience got a lot of

1678
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,760
information out of this and

1679
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,200
again thank you all very much for your

1680
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,880
time

1681
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,839
thank you
