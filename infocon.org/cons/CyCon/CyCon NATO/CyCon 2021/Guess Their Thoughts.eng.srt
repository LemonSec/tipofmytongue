today

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
i'm moderating this panel in which

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
together with our distinguished speakers

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
we will focus on cyber threat

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,879
intelligence

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,160
that is a vital key to prevent

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
and mitigate cyber attacks the panel

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
is nicely balanced speakers with the

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,039
experience

private sector as well

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,559
today three presentations will be

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,280
introduced

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
followed by a discussion first federico

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,799
cheruti will introduce an

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
ai based solution that helps the

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
effective identification

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
and response to cyber threats after that

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
we will dig deeper in threat actor

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
characterization

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
vasia's majoris will shed light on the

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,880
details

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
of the topic the final presentation will

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
be rather practical

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,200
chaba krasnay and gergener will discuss

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
the possibilities and limitations in

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,720
cyber threat intelligence with the focus

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,479
on energy systems dear arduinos

federico the floor is yours

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
thank you very much for the kind

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
introduction

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,000
and my

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
paper today is about

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
how a artificial intelligence system

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
can support intelligence

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
analyst for effective identification

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,239
response

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
to cyber threat and the key

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
element here is the self-aware element

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
at the very beginning as we will discuss

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
in a few slides this is a joint walk

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
with several colleagues at the

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
university of russia in italy in

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
particular pedro barrone

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
daniela foley massimilian jacomin and

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
francesco gringoli and juveniguida

92
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,400
and a subject much subject matter expert

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
paul sullivan who is a retired coroner

94
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
from the us army

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,040
let's face it we are gonna have

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
significant challenges

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
uh from this year onwards the

98
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,159
number of threat menace online have been

99
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
substantially increased and it is

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
just getting worse and worse every

101
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,879
single time

102
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,519
but in these times it's always useful to

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,080
come back

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,279
to the fundamentals and the fundamentals

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,560
we have are the uh the federation most

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,519
of the

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
attacks did not change substantially

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
with the pandemic and with the

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,680
with several problems going viral

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
in this last few months but we still

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,280
have

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
this substantial pattern of

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
reconnaissance weaponization

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
delivery exploitation installation

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
command control and then actions and

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
objectives

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
and this doesn't change much

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
didn't change much in the last few

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
months which means that

120
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,080
our infrastructure is still quite

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
good we can already have our

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
security operation center our incident

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
response teams

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
our information security officer all of

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,919
that

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,960
is absolutely brilliant and uh we could

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
not be

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
doing what we are doing without all of

129
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
these personnel

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,960
but uh the real question is all of them

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
are basing their operation

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
on information which means that uh

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
ultimately

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
information is

135
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,840
and when we talk about information and

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
intelligence

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
analysis in particular we are referring

138
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,160
to

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
a process that is not terribly

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
new every single confrontation every

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
single battle in the past

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
always had an element of intelligence

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,280
analysis

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
which means that we can actually borrow

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
from a substantial

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
large um literature

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,919
and um among other models

148
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
i'm particularly fond of the perolian

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
card model

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
looking at at the intelligence analysis

151
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,199
as a continuous iterative cycle

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
starting from some direction setting

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
from a decision maker

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
opposing some questions or requesting

155
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
some piece of advice

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,880
then is the role of the intelligence

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,400
analyst to

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
go and check for data sources sources

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,759
that

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,880
can be come and that can trigger

161
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,759
a data collection process the data is

162
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,080
now

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
going into screw boxes the from there to

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
evidence file

165
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
and this is what is traditionally

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
described as the foraging loop

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
and then from evidence file there is a

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
substantial

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
step forward using data processing

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
techniques for entering

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
schema and the from the to go

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
into the realm of hypothesis thanks to

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,319
data analysis

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
and once we have hypothesis um

175
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
which means that we can have some sort

176
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
of understanding

177
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
of what is happening in the reality or

178
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,800
at least we have

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,599
reasons to believe or to not believe

180
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,880
some of the different

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
competing hypotheses we have to explain

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
the reality or to

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
understand or to predict what could be

184
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,240
happening

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
next so from hypothesis that is where

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
most of the critical thinking is

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
happening and then

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
once the intelligence analyst reached

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,199
a conclusion then there is a problem how

190
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,479
to

191
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,240
disseminate the the results the decision

192
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,880
maker

193
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
now as you can see here in reality all

194
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
of them are

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
different loops while i just describe it

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,080
from one end to the other in reality an

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
analyst can just start for instance

198
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
from my hypothesis or from other part

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
and then going through all the various

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
steps

201
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,240
and um that um

202
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
in this presentation i will focus mostly

203
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
on data processing and data analysis

204
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
not just because there are um

205
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
that that is why artificial intelligence

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
can be massively

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,120
useful and but i'm not um saying that

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
data sources uh or data collection that

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
doesn't have

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
uh their own complexity and their own

211
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
element of interest it's just that

212
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
we needed to focus on some specific

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
aspect of this cycle

214
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,599
and when we are talking about the cycle

215
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,479
we often

216
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
have this uh view that we are the good

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
guy

218
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,519
against some bad guys but uh the reality

219
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
is slightly more complex

220
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
the reality is that uh adversary

221
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
are as smart as we are our adversary

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
are doing their own counter intelligence

223
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
operations over our intelligence so

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
the reality is substantially more

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
complicated and that's why

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,160
we need what is the main contribution of

227
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,279
this paper

228
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,399
namely this iterator for artificial

229
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,000
intelligence systems

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
so if we want to have an ai system to

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,600
support an intelligence analysis

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
process then we discuss

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
what could be the this idea rhythm that

234
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
is the data that

235
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
we must need to embrace

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,480
the first one is we are not here to

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
replace

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
human analysts and that's why we put as

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
fast as iteration

240
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
the fact that the analyst must be at the

241
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
center of

242
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,240
uh any endeavor so ultimately

243
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
there at least at the present time there

244
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
will always be

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
a human analyst having to answer

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
a request from a decision maker which

247
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,800
means that

248
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,080
what we can do to help the analyst is

249
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
to use a language that you share between

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,200
the

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
the machine and the analysis itself with

252
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
using specific ontologies

253
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
etc etc but also having perhaps the

254
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,519
possibility to have

255
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,399
a dialogue a continuous dialogue between

256
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,640
the analyst and the machine so to lower

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,519
the bar

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,000
to uh discuss elements with the machine

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
itself

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
the second element is that there is no

261
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
certain thing in the world

262
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
everything comes out with shades of

263
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,440
of truth and of certainty

264
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
which means that uh very we cannot fool

265
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
the analysts we need to embrace

266
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,880
uncertainty we need to

267
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,600
be able to reason about uncertainty at

268
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
the machine level but we need also to be

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,880
able to

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
explain uncertainty to the final analyst

271
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,760
so to let him or her

272
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
understand better what is the complexity

273
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,839
behind

274
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
the situation we are facing and then the

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,160
situation we are facing

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,600
are not simple events they are not just

277
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
one-off

278
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,959
the cyber kill chain is is

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
is is where we started and it telling is

280
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
telling us that

281
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,800
an attack is often a process that span

282
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,360
anything from seconds to minutes to

283
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
hours

284
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
to days the weeks to month sometimes

285
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,839
years

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
which means that uh being able to

287
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
understand that

288
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,320
events are connected each other with

289
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,279
temporal

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,079
causal links and being able to reason

291
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,880
about them

292
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
is absolutely necessary and all of that

293
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
takes the

294
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
the name of complex event in literature

295
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,800
and finally because the adversary is as

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
smart as we are

297
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
we need to be able to have high order

298
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
level of thinking which means that each

299
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,120
of our

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
actions will have consequences each our

301
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,720
action

302
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,880
might send a message to the attacker

303
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
which means that we need to

304
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,519
to to use strategic thinking

305
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
whenever we are deciding our counter

306
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,959
measures

307
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,120
at any time in the cyber kill chain

308
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,160
now the paper goes into details of

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
several elements within all of these

310
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
this iterator

311
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
for this presentation we just focus on

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,079
embracing uncertainty recognize complex

313
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,600
events

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
and starting from

315
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
embracing uncertainty everything

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
every piece of data comes with shade

317
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
of uncertainty and uh but there are

318
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,279
different types of uncertainty

319
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
and that has been recognized in

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
literature since quite a long time now

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
there is the aliatoric uncertainty or

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
auditory uncertainty

323
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
that is the variability in the outcome

324
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
of an experiment

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,320
which is inherent uh to the random

326
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,959
element

327
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,920
so if we are flipping a fair coin the

328
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
probability of a head or tail

329
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
will always be 0.5 no additional source

330
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
of information but laplace demand can

331
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,839
reduce

332
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,040
such a variability instead we have

333
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,120
another element another completely

334
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
different domain

335
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
of uncertainty that takes the name of

336
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,600
epistemic uncertainty

337
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
that is based on the amount of

338
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
information we have on the phenomenon

339
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
itself

340
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
so if the question goes from uh

341
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
what is the probability of having ad

342
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,360
out of flipping a fair coin into let's

343
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
evaluate whether the coin is

344
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,639
fair observing the output

345
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
then it means that if we have three

346
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,680
heads

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
two tails we have a ratio of three to

348
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
two

349
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
uh we might conclude that the the coin

350
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
is not fair

351
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
but at the same time we should also

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,519
acknowledge that we are not entirely

353
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,240
certain

354
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
about what is the phenomenon we are

355
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
observing because we do not have enough

356
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
data

357
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
but if instead we toss the coin five

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
thousand times and three thousand

359
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
times we have had two thousand times we

360
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
have tail

361
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
then we can start having a little more

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
of confidence that uh

363
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,760
maybe the the coin is not fair which

364
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,320
means that

365
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
what i just described is a manifestation

366
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
of what is called epistemic uncertainty

367
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
and generally the more the data the fee

368
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
the lower is the epistemic uncertainty

369
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
and that is often linked

370
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,639
to the variance of a distribution

371
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
that is behind the

372
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,639
the representation of the of the

373
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,120
phenomenon we have

374
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
so if we take a very simple uh example

375
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,440
of

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
data analysis we can think about having

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
this one as a

378
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,959
toy representation of two classes we

379
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,000
have the the

380
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
violet and the blue and uh if we are

381
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,639
using a traditional

382
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,199
neural network with a soft max layer at

383
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,399
the very end

384
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
and we are projecting on the background

385
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,040
of this picture the confidence

386
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,240
so the sort of representation of

387
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
uh of uncertainty associate we we we

388
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
with what we are uh classifying we can

389
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,279
see that

390
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
the darker is where we are more

391
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
uncertain and the lighter green

392
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
the lighter yellow is where we are more

393
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,279
certain

394
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,920
so we can see that there is a decision

395
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,959
boundary

396
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,519
um separating the left from the right

397
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,160
and

398
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,639
there in the between is where we are

399
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,760
mostly uncertain

400
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
right so what uh we would like instead

401
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,720
to achieve

402
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
instead of having this picture where if

403
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,000
you take uh

404
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,680
the the at the bottom part the star

405
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,040
blue we can see let's say in the future

406
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,399
in the future representation if we can

407
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
just push it a little

408
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,040
to the right and we just pass through

409
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,600
the

410
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
decision boundary then this blue

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,720
star will magically become a purple star

412
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
and that is what adversarial machine

413
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,600
learning would do

414
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
and that is what a smart adversary would

415
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,639
do

416
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
just trick a little what is the code

417
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
behind

418
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
its attack in order to just push from

419
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
what can be detected as an attack into

420
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,279
what can be seen as a normal piece of

421
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,240
software

422
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
but instead what we would like to do is

423
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
something more complex we would like to

424
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,639
have

425
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,320
a more a richer representation of

426
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
what is the electorate and the epistemic

427
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
uncertainty

428
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,560
which is resulting from research we run

429
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
with colleagues at army research lab and

430
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
osiegen university

431
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
last year and although that was not

432
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
in the domain of cyber security that is

433
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,480
that was

434
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
inspirational for the work that i'm

435
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,800
presenting to you right now

436
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
and what we are doing is instead of

437
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,639
transforming

438
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
or having a classification problem

439
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
resulting in a probability

440
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
of whether a data point is let's say a

441
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
malware or a non-malware

442
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
we now have what we can see on the right

443
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,119
part of the slide

444
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,000
a distribution in particular case at

445
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,919
this case a beta distribution

446
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,000
that is telling us the distribution of

447
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
probabilities

448
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,240
of um of our that

449
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,039
our data point is um

450
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
is a malware episode malware or not now

451
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
we can do better than this one we can

452
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
transform this one into what is called a

453
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
subjective logic opinion

454
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,559
that is a more compact representation

455
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,320
of this uncertainty element

456
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,720
they came up into a triangle of

457
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
different opinions where at the top we

458
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,240
have

459
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,120
the complete lack of confidence at the

460
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,760
bottom

461
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
the more we are getting to the bottom we

462
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
are more confident and then

463
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
to the left we not believe something

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
while on the right we will be leaving

465
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,640
something

466
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
so in this case we can just put on the

467
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,039
uh uh an opinion a piece of information

468
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
on this triangle and that will represent

469
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,240
could be a potential representation for

470
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
the uncertainty for

471
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,799
uh for the uh for the final user of this

472
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,440
system

473
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
and they can also be translated into a

474
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,760
natural language

475
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,120
text now

476
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,320
the word is complex and i was mentioning

477
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,960
this these type of attacks are complex

478
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
too which means that

479
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
what we also need to do is to be able to

480
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
recognize this complexity

481
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,320
and start thinking not just as a single

482
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
uh as a classifying potentially single

483
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
elements of this type of attack but

484
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
linking events together so perhaps

485
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
an attack can start with a traditional

486
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
fishing type of attack

487
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
where we can observe perhaps the logs of

488
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
our nectar

489
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,320
network and we can see that the the

490
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
10.1.1.23

491
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,480
is accessing a fishing a fished

492
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,440
website and we can do that by using for

493
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,000
instance we

494
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
a neural network that is detecting

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
whether the url has been fished or not

496
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
um then we can link together the fact

497
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
that log

498
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,440
02 and log04 are coming from the same

499
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
source ip and the logo zero four is

500
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
downloading

501
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,080
something from another website uh that

502
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,480
we

503
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
perhaps can analyze in a different way

504
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
with that that is we generate the id in

505
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,720
e05 that is telling us that these are

506
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
trojon

507
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
so all of that one can aggregate

508
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
together to inform us that

509
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
there is an uh we are at the stage of

510
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
delivery

511
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
of an advanced persistent threat type of

512
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
attack

513
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
and from there then as i was mentioning

514
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,679
uh we can

515
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,039
have the the problem of deciding how to

516
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,919
respond is uh this attack and for that

517
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,400
one

518
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
i will refer you to the details in the

519
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,600
paper

520
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
so to conclude uh this presentation

521
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,840
in this paper we introduced for this

522
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
iterator

523
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
for artificial intelligence systems for

524
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
supporting intelligence analysis

525
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,799
in the cyber threat domain the first one

526
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,880
is to always put the analysis analyst at

527
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,520
the center

528
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,080
we are not here to replace the human we

529
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,960
are here to

530
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
augment our own capabilities the second

531
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,880
one is that

532
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,559
we need to embrace uncertainty and the

533
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,400
different shade of uncertainty that

534
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
there are there from aliataric to

535
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,919
epistemic uncertainty

536
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,039
we need to face the fact that we are a

537
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,000
problem we are

538
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
addressing problematic situations that

539
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,960
are requiring

540
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,400
an analysis of complex events and

541
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,280
our opponent is as smart as we are which

542
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
means that we need to

543
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,880
run our own intelligence counter

544
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,960
intelligence and strategic thinking

545
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,039
whenever we are deciding how to operate

546
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,240
with them

547
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
with this one i thank you very much for

548
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,840
your attention and i welcome any

549
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
question

550
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
but eco thank you very much for your

551
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
nice and comprehensive presentation

552
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,360
i really liked it and only one question

553
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
popped up in my mind

554
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,679
is the system implemented or what are

555
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
the plans

556
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
so the system is currently uh

557
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,760
implemented as

558
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
research grade prototype in the

559
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
different parts

560
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,880
we are currently merging the different

561
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,440
parts

562
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
together and for that one we are

563
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,720
borrowing

564
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
from advanced research in particular in

565
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
in

566
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,400
in ontologies for cyber threat

567
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
intelligence analysis

568
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,520
and the idea would be to release it

569
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
as a platform for research

570
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
mainly for research um the idea is to

571
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,159
also to run experiments with

572
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,919
potentially expert user to understand

573
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,360
how we can

574
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
support them better from a technical

575
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
perspective we have already

576
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
for instance all the analysis on

577
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
epistemic and atari uncertainties

578
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,360
already implemented

579
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,080
is running very nicely out of the box uh

580
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
for complex event

581
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
processing we already have an end-to-end

582
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
system for

583
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
learning and reasoning on that one

584
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
albeit

585
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,360
only limited on on the on what type of

586
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
or how many levels of cosight we can

587
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
deal with

588
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
and for strategic thinking we already

589
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,320
have a system for control query

590
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
evaluation

591
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,039
which is helping the the analysts to

592
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
to understand how much piece of

593
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
information is revealing

594
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
with each action and countermeasure is

595
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
putting forward

596
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,760
thank you uh i really encourage our kind

597
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
audience to

598
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
address their questions as i mentioned

599
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,799
before thank you very much for your

600
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,760
presentation

601
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,039
and let's thanks to you let's move

602
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,840
forward

603
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,240
to the next presentation our next

604
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,120
speaker

605
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
is vasilios mavrovis who is a research

606
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
scientist and educator

607
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,600
in the cyber security at the in cyber

608
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,240
security

609
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,960
at the university of hosto specialized

610
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
in security automation

611
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
and cyber threat intelligence generation

612
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,919
representation

613
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
and sharing he has been affiliated

614
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,559
with multiple multinational and european

615
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,960
cyber security research and innovation

616
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,679
project

617
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
in warrior's role and has been

618
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
actively involved in cyber security

619
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,919
standardization

620
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,840
was serious the floor is yours

621
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,799
very pleased to be here today to talk

622
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,960
about our research on cyber threat

623
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,559
intelligence

624
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,840
so today we'll talk about threat actor

625
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
characterization

626
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
meaning how we establish and represent

627
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
adversarial personas

628
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,159
i will discuss the current technological

629
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
status of that

630
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
generally what's the future of it and

631
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,360
we'll discuss a little about the

632
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,279
benefits of

633
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,320
standardization in cyber threat

634
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,960
intelligence with a particular focus on

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
creating vocabularies that we can all

636
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
use to describe

637
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,880
adversaries and these all together align

638
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
with our research work that was

639
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,600
published

640
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
at the second proceedings on threat

641
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,559
actor type inference and

642
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,000
characterization

643
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
which is just a concrete use case of

644
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,559
how universally agreed upon vocabularies

645
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,240
or simply stated a language for

646
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
describing adversaries

647
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,520
allow us to easier correlate and analyze

648
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,200
different sources of information

649
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,320
that describe adversaries resolve also

650
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
ambiguity with respect to their

651
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,039
characterization

652
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,440
and gives us the ability to perform a

653
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
reasoning

654
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
and in our case reasoning is the ability

655
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:49,919
of

656
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,720
machines to infer new information in a

657
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,360
real time

658
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
actually surprisingly an hour ago i

659
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
noticed on my linkedin feed

660
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
an article that was published yesterday

661
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
from cisco talos

662
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,760
team talking about hybridized

663
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,880
adversaries

664
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
that don't really nowadays belong

665
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,480
exactly

666
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
to one of the known existing

667
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
classification categories that they use

668
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,159
in that article they talk about how they

669
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,799
want to more

670
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,520
granularly refer to state sponsor

671
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,799
related groups

672
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,000
by splitting that known category to more

673
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,520
based on their different defining

674
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
characteristics uh in the same article

675
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
they also talk about

676
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
uh a new type category for threat actors

677
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,279
named

678
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,799
privateers and they have come up with a

679
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
criteria a group needs to meet to be

680
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,120
classified as a privateer

681
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,679
so so we can see that understanding the

682
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,159
the traits of adversaries and

683
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
how their behaviors change or not over

684
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,600
time

685
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
is becoming more and more important more

686
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
and more apparent

687
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,039
soon enough i do believe that we will

688
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,640
reach a point where

689
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
cyber threat intelligence and in general

690
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
tracking adversarial groups

691
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,799
will become a big data problem um today

692
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
we track a couple of hundred groups and

693
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,600
uh a really large number of uh intrusion

694
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,080
sets

695
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,159
but uh this number will keep increasing

696
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,360
and and

697
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
as cyber uh becomes the most prominent

698
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
way to fulfill

699
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
uh nefarious plans you know existing

700
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,279
adversaries will also demonstrate

701
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,559
polymorphic behaviors

702
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,480
they'll start changing they'll start

703
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
adapting um

704
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
and polymorphism is a property that

705
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,320
we need to start thinking we need to

706
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,880
start tracking and understand

707
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200
all those transitions have an underlying

708
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,799
reason and uh

709
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,799
maybe it's maybe it's time to start

710
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,840
capturing and

711
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
understanding those transitions and

712
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,120
possibly the reasons that influence them

713
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,840
um for example we have seen adversaries

714
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,679
that were conducting

715
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,360
until yesterday cyber espionage

716
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,000
campaigns for geopolitical reasons

717
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
but now have transitioned to financially

718
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,760
motivated cyber crime

719
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
and this also requires an adversary to

720
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
utilize also a different set of

721
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
tactics techniques and procedures to to

722
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
achieve its goals

723
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
so as defenders we need to have

724
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,159
visibility and knowledge about those

725
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,799
things

726
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
uh to increase our situational awareness

727
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,279
and also transition to more proactive

728
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,360
defense

729
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
by mainly having a better way to

730
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,320
correlate further analyze and query

731
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,960
cyber threat intelligence so if you

732
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
think about it

733
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,799
as of today we have succeeded to have

734
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,080
standard ways to enumerate

735
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,279
and characterize tactics and techniques

736
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,080
with a mitre attack framework we can

737
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,399
enumerate and get information about

738
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,840
vulnerabilities using the

739
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
cv standard and the national

740
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
vulnerability database

741
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,640
we have a way to define the severity of

742
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,919
vulnerability

743
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,240
by using the common vulnerability

744
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
scoring system

745
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
we even have a way to enumerate in a

746
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
standard way

747
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
software by using the common platform

748
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
enumeration standard

749
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
and many other efforts right so so i do

750
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
believe that it's apparent to

751
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,399
to come up with a common way to describe

752
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,240
adversaries and

753
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,960
in other words their characteristics uh

754
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,679
their defining attributes

755
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,399
um to achieve that um we need to develop

756
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,799
standard vocabularies that unambiguously

757
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,679
enumerate and describe different

758
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
adversary types like

759
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
a civil activist and what is a civil

760
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
activist

761
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,600
organized cyber crime and what is

762
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120
organized cyber crime

763
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
if we talk about adversary motivations

764
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
for example

765
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
what does it mean to be ideologically

766
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,000
politically

767
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,159
financially or or geopolitically

768
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
motivated

769
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,120
and make publicly available those

770
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,799
vocabularies for use and their

771
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,240
descriptions right that will allow to

772
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,960
seamlessly

773
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
seamlessly use them

774
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,520
that way we agree upon the language

775
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
we agree upon a common language and we

776
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,279
minimize possibly ambiguity and the

777
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
difficulty to use it

778
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
this is something that the cyber

779
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,159
security community or even better the

780
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,440
threat intel community

781
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
and needs to decide together this is the

782
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
reason such kind of

783
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,679
attempts need need to be standards based

784
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,399
efforts

785
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,440
where we create official groups and we

786
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
decide all together about common

787
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
terminology that we all start using

788
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
in our different daily operations cyber

789
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,000
security operations

790
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,039
this may be from generating intelligence

791
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,559
reports in pdf

792
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,520
or sharing several intelligence using

793
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
more machinery double waste

794
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,000
like using sticks so

795
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
if you take intelligence reports or

796
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
investigate different publicly available

797
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,279
adversary knowledge bases

798
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,480
today you will notice that even though

799
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,440
they are nice to read

800
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,880
it's quite challenging to operationalize

801
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,559
this is because most of the time its

802
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,880
empty is using its own vocabularies to

803
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,360
describe

804
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
something and many times that something

805
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
is very unambiguous or

806
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,559
end up not having the same meaning

807
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,000
exactly uh

808
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
even to another country um the simplest

809
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
example that i'm always bringing is that

810
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
um

811
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,919
uh this the simple information right

812
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,760
that an adversary is known to target

813
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
critical infrastructure

814
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
what is critical infrastructure the

815
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,760
united states defines 16 sectors as

816
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,240
critical infrastructures whereas

817
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,200
the european union's misdirective

818
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
defined seven

819
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,240
so resolving such kind of issues will

820
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,039
help

821
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,760
correlation will support understanding

822
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,039
adversaries better and

823
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
in a more temporal way and at the end of

824
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,200
the day it's all about the

825
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
credibility of threat intelligence

826
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,399
having those

827
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,159
standardized vocabularies will allow

828
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,600
defenders to really create and

829
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,080
answer more complex questions and most

830
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,840
importantly

831
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
as present in our research we will lay

832
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,159
the foundation for

833
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,320
facilitating information inference which

834
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
is the future

835
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
since a human analyst won't be able to

836
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,760
keep up with the insights that the

837
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,840
machine can derive

838
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,120
but teens like humans need to have the

839
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,840
ability to understand what we represent

840
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,240
ambiguously so in our research in

841
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
particular

842
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
we utilized one of the known early works

843
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,039
of

844
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,760
team casey intel corporation known as

845
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,279
the threat agent library

846
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,080
so the threat agent library provides us

847
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,720
with a

848
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
comprehensive list of adversary

849
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,320
archetypes

850
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,399
and they are defining attributes they're

851
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,000
defining characteristics

852
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,519
and we use this information to develop

853
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,039
an ontology

854
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,000
um what is an ontology genetology is a

855
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,799
type of

856
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
knowledge representation and in our case

857
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,279
we used

858
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,360
the web ontology language to capture all

859
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
these existing information from the

860
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,200
threat agent library

861
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
but now we expressed it using machine

862
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,440
readable approach

863
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,960
so for example threat agent library

864
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,640
defines

865
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,919
one archetype this gradle employee

866
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,519
and then enumerates the characteristics

867
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,519
of this type based on its objectives

868
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,000
the results of a describing employee has

869
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
access to

870
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,559
their skills their motivation

871
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,919
and many other attributes so all these

872
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,799
attributes are

873
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,000
vocabularies that are used internally

874
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
initially they were used internally at

875
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,679
intel for risk management

876
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
this was the reason the threat agent

877
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,039
library was created

878
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,240
they are their own standard vocabularies

879
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
so in our results we used what is

880
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,559
available in the threat agent

881
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,559
library with some tweaks to elevate it

882
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
and resolve possible

883
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,690
ontological ambiguities and

884
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,000
[Music]

885
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
based on that we started investigating

886
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,559
adversarial operations from

887
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,080
publicly available reports and created

888
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,159
and we created adversary profiles based

889
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,039
on what we read

890
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,200
by using the reasoning capability of

891
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,559
ontologies

892
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
we codified the domain expertise that

893
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,039
was offered in the threat agent library

894
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,519
and based on that we could automatically

895
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
infer the threat actor type for each

896
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,600
operation

897
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,440
that we investigated so

898
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,640
based on the attributes that we derived

899
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,880
from investigating let's say an

900
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
operation a

901
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
um we automatically inferred let's say

902
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,559
that this operation indicates

903
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,720
characteristics of

904
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,840
nation-state-sponsored activity and

905
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,799
let's say for

906
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,000
um operation b

907
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
based on the attributes that we derived

908
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,799
by reading uh the intelligence reports

909
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,559
we automatically inferred that this

910
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,799
activity

911
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,799
is related to cybercrime to

912
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,799
a group that conducts cyber crime so

913
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,200
two operations um two different threat

914
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,000
actor types

915
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,279
but it happens that these operations

916
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,000
to be connected so when these operations

917
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,120
are connected

918
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,839
uh based on some let's say overlapping

919
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,440
overlapping activity

920
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,599
or attribution um they demonstrate

921
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
different protector types that have a

922
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,719
relation

923
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,399
it indicates different motivations and

924
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,199
objectives

925
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
and possibly different texts and

926
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,199
techniques that this particular

927
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,719
intrusion set or demonstrate or

928
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,399
adversary demonstrates so

929
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,239
the conclusion here is that we have the

930
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,719
ability to track adversary polymorphism

931
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,760
an adversary that started yesterday as

932
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,239
a nation state sponsored group that was

933
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,960
mainly

934
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
geopolitically motivated has now

935
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,239
for reason transitioned to conducting

936
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,119
cyber crime now it's financially

937
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,679
motivated

938
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,320
this is what offers to have standardized

939
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,760
vocabularies

940
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,480
for describing characterizing

941
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,440
adversaries

942
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,359
that no matter who is populating the

943
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,280
threat intelligence reports or if it is

944
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
part of

945
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,839
threat intelligence sharing efforts can

946
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
use

947
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,440
to summarize the conclusion is that we

948
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
have the ability to track adversary

949
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,920
polymorphism

950
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
and also using a set of standard

951
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,359
attributes

952
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,440
will better allow us to derive more

953
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,280
relevant intelligence for organization

954
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
and answer

955
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
more complex questions based on those

956
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,480
attributes

957
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,920
yes and this mainly summarizes

958
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,359
our research so if you have any

959
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,079
questions i'm ready to

960
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,640
answer them

961
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,000
thank you wassilos for your brief

962
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,880
presentation

963
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
i really liked it and a question

964
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,599
came up basically if we want to

965
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,079
to utilize this common language and the

966
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,640
standardized

967
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
vocabulary to make it very effective we

968
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,040
have to extend it

969
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,839
over the borders so every country should

970
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,839
contribute somehow

971
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,760
who do you think should be the right

972
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,079
international organization

973
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,000
to lead this project to lead the

974
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,119
standardization

975
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
and maintaining the cyber attack

976
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,839
vocabulary

977
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
that's a good point so as i said

978
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
in my opinion it should be a

979
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
standards-based work

980
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,200
multiple organizations around the world

981
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,680
uh

982
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,880
need to contribute we all need to agree

983
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,440
upon

984
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,850
um there is

985
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,240
[Music]

986
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
a new group standards

987
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,640
track group that works on that

988
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
they are called the threat actor context

989
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,960
community

990
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,920
but here we have to um it's

991
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,280
two-dimensional right

992
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
because on one side we have to

993
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
create the vocabularies that we are all

994
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,599
supposed to you

995
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,800
and then we have also the representation

996
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
problem

997
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,510
and this again something that

998
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,800
[Music]

999
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
we are multiple threat intelligence

1000
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
platforms there are multiple threat

1001
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
intelligence sharing

1002
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,839
standards um we're also generating

1003
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,000
threat reports described in pros

1004
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,839
so that makes it a little more

1005
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,760
challenging to process we need most of

1006
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
the times natural language processing

1007
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,240
so the problem is two dimensional but

1008
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,720
for sure

1009
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,880
it should be addressed by

1010
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
integrating it within a standard

1011
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,760
developing

1012
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,680
organization i'm not going to take a

1013
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
position i mean

1014
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,119
all countries need to contribute so

1015
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,240
which organization

1016
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,119
is it it doesn't matter as long as we

1017
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,320
all contribute to that

1018
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
we need to agree upon i agree

1019
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
thank you very much um it was it was a

1020
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,280
very nice and and i think it's a very

1021
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,560
straightforward

1022
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,839
to set up this kind of initiatives

1023
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,480
and uh i think both of your

1024
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
presentations shed light on the on the

1025
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,280
difficulty

1026
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
that we are facing with in the case of

1027
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
uh cyber

1028
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,079
threat intelligence but the next paper

1029
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,680
that was written by two

1030
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,960
authors will introduce a kind of

1031
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,040
solution

1032
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
gabriel jebner who is the co-author of

1033
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,480
the paper

1034
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
is a certified information security

with my co-author

1088
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,440
gabriel debnar and our topic uh will be

1089
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,160
some kind

1090
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,440
uh of the next steps on the previous

1091
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
presentation we will talk about our

1092
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,640
experiences

1093
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
on cyber that intelligence and

1094
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
information sharing on a national level

1095
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
and we will focus on the technical

1096
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,720
difficulties and the technical

1097
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,440
challenges

1098
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,760
but i have to tell you that besides the

1099
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
technical it is

1100
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,160
our research is uh two threaded the

1101
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,720
first

1102
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,839
thread is the technical level the second

1103
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,400
thread

1104
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,280
is the legislation questions and we are

1105
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,079
not doing

1106
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,200
just uh by the two institutes uh

1107
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,280
what you can see here but we are also

1108
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
working together with

1109
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,520
the members with the actors of the

1110
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,400
hungarian

1111
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,720
electricity systems so we are working

1112
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,000
together with power plants

1113
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,280
energy companies and national

1114
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
authorities and also

1115
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,480
ics cada manufacturers in our country

1116
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,760
therefore it's quite a complex project

1117
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,240
and its major goal is to protect of

1118
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,960
course

1119
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,599
our nation and our national electricity

1120
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,240
grid

1121
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,280
and uh i think that uh the importance of

1122
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,960
protect the protection of the national

1123
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,079
electricity grid

1124
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,119
uh can be more emphasized as it was said

1125
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,440
by president biden approximately one

1126
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,720
month ago

1127
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,920
then his executive order says that in

1128
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,520
100 days

1129
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,720
the u.s electricity grid should be

1130
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
protected from the attacks

1131
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
from the cyber space and the question is

1132
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,960
why now because they have the nerc ship

1133
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,760
they have the nist special publications

1134
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,480
the 800 that the 18th hubris series

1135
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,079
um both really well very well covered uh

1136
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,800
focusing on the the industrial systems

1137
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,160
uh they also have

1138
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,960
um very huge capacities and huge

1139
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,040
resources to protect their own national

1140
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,680
grid

1141
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
uh the attacks against their electricity

1142
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,760
systems and in general the energy system

1143
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,000
is

1144
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,240
nothing new as it was published

1145
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,359
continuously since the mid 2010s

1146
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,400
um so why now and just to

1147
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,640
emphasize more that question how could

1148
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
it happen that in a

1149
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,359
few weeks ago one of their major

1150
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,960
critical information infrastructures

1151
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
colonial pipeline

1152
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,280
was successfully attacked by ransomware

1153
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,560
by a group called

1154
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,760
darkside and how could it happen then

1155
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
the supply chain there regarding

1156
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,880
the the pipelines

1157
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,599
could be halted because of this cyber

1158
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,319
attack

1159
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,359
and that led to a research question

1160
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,079
what we asked from ourselves three years

1161
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:14,640
ago

1162
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,839
and those questions were that first of

1163
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,240
all

1164
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,319
are we able to create the right cyber

1165
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,160
intel tools including honeypots and

1166
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,839
traditional intelligence

1167
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,480
to protect our own national grids

1168
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,040
because

1169
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,280
uh cyber internationals it's obvious uh

1170
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,200
there are a lot of honey pots honey nets

1171
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,720
there are a lot of services

1172
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,839
but uh can we use that in real life do

1173
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,760
we have enough information from that

1174
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
the second question was do we have

1175
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,280
specific information for a mid-sized

1176
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,720
country's critical information

1177
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,760
infrastructure

1178
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
that is not a huge market for big

1179
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,040
vendors and widely used locally

1180
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,480
developed dota systems

1181
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,520
we have a list on the already identified

1182
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,200
cyber attacks against the electricity

1183
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,960
systems and i can tell you that

1184
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,599
only a few countries uh notified the

1185
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,240
public

1186
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
on cyber attacks on their electricity

1187
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,800
systems does that mean that

1188
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,040
almost 200 countries are not yet

1189
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,000
attacked

1190
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,920
from the cyber um our hypothesis that is

1191
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,720
it is not true we simply can't really uh

1192
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,800
able to detect such attacks

1193
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,599
and of course um there are a lot of very

1194
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,319
good

1195
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,240
products and and very very good

1196
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,440
solutions to protect the auto systems

1197
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,599
but i have to tell you that in our

1198
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,880
systems uh

1199
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,920
our vendors are are usually local

1200
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,680
vendors and they are selling their

1201
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,000
specific ulti products to the local

1202
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,880
companies

1203
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,720
and the third question is that how can

1204
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
we share information in a local

1205
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,359
community

1206
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,680
uh how can we share between local

1207
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
authorities and of course how can

1208
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,119
uh local authorities and private

1209
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,640
companies and how can we share

1210
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,520
information

1211
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
uh in trans-border relations that is a

1212
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,280
very very tough question

1213
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,440
and last but not least do we have the

1214
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,960
right deep technical standards or

1215
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,920
recommendations

1216
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,560
for our critical infrastructures because

1217
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,240
of course we can see the

1218
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,160
u.s ones but can we use that in reality

1219
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,560
and the answers are very wide we do

1220
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,480
really have enough time for that

1221
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,800
but just focusing on the technical it is

1222
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,760
i passed the word

1223
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
to my co-author gerg who will tell you

1224
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,079
uh what were our results uh from the

1225
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
technical perspective

1226
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,400
i really appreciate each other so what

1227
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,560
started us thinking about that there is

1228
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,640
a need a sector-specific

1229
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,200
feed is the noise and the unnecessary

1230
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,119
computational

1231
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,359
requirement that this general proposed

1232
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,560
cti

1233
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,920
is required and the sector-specific use

1234
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
of human threat intelligence is

1235
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,920
is is obvious but if you were running an

1236
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
otc and

1237
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,960
logging into your enterprise sim

1238
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,599
to a proper correlation for the ot and i

1239
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,880
t events

1240
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,119
and it works as a tenant rate then it

1241
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,960
makes sense that what alerts are

1242
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
generated and forwarded for further

1243
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,599
analyzes

1244
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,880
correlation not to mention that

1245
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,000
if you are on that maturity level and

1246
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
where you can do proactive workarounds

1247
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,480
and approaches like retrospective

1248
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,440
analysis

1249
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,000
where we are using a kind of big data

1250
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,040
and the numeracy

1251
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,520
of false positives can also without the

1252
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,680
kind of big data

1253
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,240
so there are some good sources like

1254
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,520
showdown and

1255
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,839
and that may support cyclops activities

1256
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,000
in ics environment but

1257
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,240
common use cases radical simple

1258
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,760
enrichment

1259
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,839
so there was nothing left but to

1260
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,359
pre-produce our own

1261
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,800
uh based of ics honeypot

1262
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,839
uh we're not just looking for iops but

1263
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,000
ttps are now under scrunty

1264
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,280
there are many solutions

1265
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,720
for emulating control protocols but

1266
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,839
there are we found a lot of useful

1267
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,839
content and existing uh

1268
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,880
source code and github and and and in

1269
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,520
in the internet but there was two points

1270
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,160
one is

1271
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,760
they are just offering a low

1272
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,440
interactivity level what is

1273
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
if you're looking for ttp then it's it's

1274
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,040
not enough

1275
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,079
and the second one if they are solved by

1276
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,319
a proxy technology what require a

1277
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,760
complex infrastructure and

1278
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,319
if you would like to automate it then if

1279
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,119
when i

1280
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,520
i say that if somebody hit it then they

1281
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
do an automation to put it on

1282
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,599
uh uh as it as it as and as a state

1283
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,520
then it's it's really hard so we built

1284
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,839
our own uh modular way

1285
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,200
and in our mvp we uh

1286
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
checked what is in the electricity the

1287
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,640
most common uh

1288
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,720
pro ics protocols modbus s7 com es 104

1289
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,240
and generic iit protocols like 10 at ftp

1290
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,839
ssh and so on uh

1291
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,119
to leverage the power of effectively

1292
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880
detecting response ac

1293
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,520
ics related cyber attacks it was clear

1294
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,040
to define the proper

1295
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
techniques techniques and procedures so

1296
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,480
we do a

1297
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,839
research as well and pinpoint

1298
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,040
those techniques what is targeted on the

1299
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,640
attack framework heat map to the

1300
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,960
electricity

1301
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,160
domain regarding the infrastructure

1302
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
there was some important point that we

1303
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,599
need to figure out during the

1304
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,800
development like

1305
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,640
separating and protecting zones

1306
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,240
monitoring and control

1307
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,960
and condition of the sensors that was

1308
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,480
that was a huge problem and

1309
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,440
of course creating a packet capture

1310
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,920
solution

1311
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,960
our honeypot have been running since

1312
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,200
2000 and they but in order to measure

1313
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
evaluate the success of their

1314
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,680
will review our data between

1315
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,920
2019 november 1 until the 4th of

1316
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,240
december at 2020.

1317
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,480
the data set represents not just the

1318
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,240
number of attacks but

1319
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,200
also the history of honeypot development

1320
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,440
and that the sense of attack represents

1321
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,880
the successful interaction of the

1322
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,599
honeypots

1323
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,520
and we filter out masculine tools and

1324
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,640
other uh host wave scans and what what

1325
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,040
we

1326
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,480
found in in the bot uh libraries

1327
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,839
and the reason because uh we we

1328
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,880
would like to focus on on the human way

1329
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
and there was a fluctuation uh

1330
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,520
as well with what we saw and that was

1331
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,599
because the availability of the cloud

1332
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,800
providers

1333
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,800
and we need to recognize that if you are

1334
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,839
hiring a top cloud provider then you are

1335
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,839
under ddrs protection what is not a

1336
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,200
normal environment

1337
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,240
and therefore for ics environments

1338
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,480
so in the generic

1339
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,359
i.t most cases connections come from

1340
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,079
both

1341
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,800
mass cans and and bots of course that

1342
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,079
was 87

1343
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,839
and already known malicious sources but

1344
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,800
because we are looking for just the

1345
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,319
icsot

1346
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,520
things that that was a 23 percent that

1347
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,200
we cannot find

1348
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,720
any other aggregated uh platforms

1349
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,680
uh in existing cti stores and we have of

1350
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,240
course

1351
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,480
a lot of open source and a lot of

1352
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,800
commercial one as well so we do a double

1353
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,680
check

1354
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,079
but but but a lot of them was not in

1355
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,200
this case and

1356
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,880
when we do uh threat hunting then

1357
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,640
then this is the the the crown jewel for

1358
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,880
us basically

1359
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,240
uh we have deployed more than a hundred

1360
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,760
honeypots over the world

1361
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,960
but germany the uk the netherlands and

1362
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,079
singapore have

1363
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,839
received the most expansionary

1364
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,200
attacks

1365
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,000
the key word for use is maturity but

1366
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,880
unfortunate

1367
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
unfortunately i have to say that we are

1368
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,319
a long way

1369
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,319
from the specific use case of threat in

1370
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,200
the crowd crowdsource based sector

1371
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,040
but with a sim or saw or idps

1372
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,520
with the right feeding of sticks and i

1373
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
mean in stick sweeting i mean

1374
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,040
sigma jorah and snort of course

1375
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,079
next to iocs with the right use

1376
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,359
then you can make a huge improvement and

1377
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,680
not just the threat hunting but to but

1378
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,400
to do a

1379
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,520
good enrichment as well and but

1380
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,800
ics intelligence need

1381
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,319
no need more knowledge

1382
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,960
and it it attack vectors and and the

1383
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,119
opposition

1384
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,359
for example if we are connecting the

1385
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
mitral framework the ics and the

1386
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,400
enterprise

1387
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
uh that could be some really interesting

1388
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
output from it

1389
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,200
and there was and we can do a lot of for

1390
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,760
example

1391
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,839
watch list if you're we are speaking

1392
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,319
about an average ioc is like

1393
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,359
ip addresses

1394
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,359
so imagine that we have a very well

1395
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,640
functioning

1396
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,520
isec electricity voter work healthcare

1397
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,559
doesn't matter

1398
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,119
a suspicious malware drops into one

1399
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,000
member's

1400
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,280
mailbox and because of the isec

1401
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,119
information sharing analytics center

1402
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,640
sector specific

1403
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,000
combina for for the for the specialist

1404
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,040
guy

1405
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,079
they everybody received this uh

1406
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,160
in the stakes feed this malware all the

1407
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,119
skill chain and

1408
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,680
and have ability for crowd source

1409
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,119
analysis

1410
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,680
and if somebody get a hit then they

1411
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,599
could do an ioc from it they could do a

1412
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,640
jar with

1413
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,200
them and they all of the isaac members

1414
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,280
are able to create an ioc

1415
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
and check the exposure of all the

1416
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,480
members

1417
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,760
and now we are far from it but

1418
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,839
it could be a goal

1419
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,880
and just just to uh summarize our

1420
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,160
experiences in hungary we

1421
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,119
realized that we need some kind of an

1422
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:13,839
sack

1423
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,319
uh therefore all the members of the

1424
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,079
hungarian electricity market

1425
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,079
as i mentioned including companies who

1426
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,359
are power plants

1427
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,160
uh including schedule manufacturers

1428
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
including cyber security

1429
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,319
vendors including the authorities who

1430
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,400
are responsible for cyber protection

1431
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,160
we created um a group called sequences

1432
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,920
security for control systems

1433
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,880
and in the last few years we try to

1434
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,480
first understand each other

1435
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,920
and find the right way to cooperate and

1436
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,520
for information sharing

1437
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,800
in information sharing of course um such

1438
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,280
that intelligence is a major challenge

1439
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,520
uh therefore we can't really solve it to

1440
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,119
to share all the information for

1441
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,000
everyone

1442
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,240
but what we have now we created at least

1443
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,599
a recommendation a book of

1444
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,359
recommendation for

1445
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,160
all the sector members and that was

1446
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,480
agreed and that was released by our

1447
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,880
national cyber security agency

1448
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,319
as official recommendation for this

1449
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:14,960
sector

1450
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,640
which is i think it's important because

1451
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,079
that is the first step

1452
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,559
but just the first step what else do we

1453
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,359
need

1454
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,319
for further steps first i have to

1455
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,359
emphasize that the

1456
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,839
nis ii directive which is uh currently

1457
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,280
under negotiation

1458
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,160
is very very needed it's very very uh

1459
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,680
needed for this market

1460
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,880
but nis ii is not enough

1461
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,599
we also need deep technical requirements

1462
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,680
and the us-based requirements

1463
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,760
is useful but not enough because there

1464
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,040
are specificities for

1465
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,760
the national markets second information

1466
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,200
sharing is vital

1467
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,960
and we have to involve the private and

1468
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,480
the public sector as well

1469
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,920
as it is written in the eu cyber

1470
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
security strategy therefore the socks

1471
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,240
and the in the inclusion of private

1472
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,079
socks into information sharing

1473
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,480
will be also seems to be successful

1474
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,319
third digital sovereignty

1475
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,319
in the eu is probably very very

1476
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,079
promising steps

1477
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,880
and we think that the national players

1478
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,760
on the ot

1479
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,960
systems will help us to protect our

1480
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,680
national systems at last but not least

1481
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,240
at least we really appreciate that cycle

1482
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,559
is existing and itali manual 3.0

1483
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,440
proposal

1484
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,359
as we think that currently the

1485
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,119
technicalities is not enough

1486
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,319
therefore cyber diplomacy should have uh

1487
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,640
give the answers for rugby actors

1488
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,599
foreign actors

1489
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,200
thank you very much for your attention

1490
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,920
and we are open for the questions

1491
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,400
thank you very much thank you for your

1492
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,280
presentation

1493
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,040
it was exciting really and uh and the

1494
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,240
question came up what was the

1495
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,520
the selection method for the countries

1496
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,559
where you installed your honeypots

1497
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,160
when we decided where to this geo

1498
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,799
analyzes let's say

1499
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,920
we measured the not just the

1500
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,400
the continents but the countries as well

1501
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,880
and we tried to diversificate as

1502
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,160
as deep as possible and most of it in

1503
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,799
europe

1504
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,079
and some percentage in america but we

1505
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,079
need to put a lot of

1506
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,359
uh around 23 of our honeypots are

1507
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,160
working in

1508
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,280
in in indonesia because

1509
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,040
yeah it's it's an interesting part of

1510
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,559
that field i see thank you

1511
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,040
uh choba was talking about information

1512
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,119
sharing data sharing and so on and

1513
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,960
bostonians had the same

1514
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,920
uh i'm really interested in your opinion

1515
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,040
uh

1516
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,119
what do you think can we establish a

1517
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,079
layered and the weighted threat uh

1518
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,119
network which can communicate active

1519
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:53,839
issues in

1520
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,520
in timely manner so what is more

1521
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,000
important that is the first and so on uh

1522
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,760
in an international level

1523
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,880
uh chabot i would like you to to answer

1524
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,520
this question

1525
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,359
first on the international level

1526
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,400
i think uh we have to do that so

1527
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,960
again we see the problems of mid-size

1528
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,319
and small countries

1529
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,680
um although maybe our cyber security

1530
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,040
agencies

1531
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,160
have uh the have some information uh

1532
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,960
some ctis that should be shared but at

1533
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,480
the end of the day

1534
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,520
those information um doesn't really

1535
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,599
get into arrive to the critical

1536
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,040
information infrastructures

1537
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,520
due to a lot of uh problems including

1538
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
technical information and of course

1539
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,559
uh because um they have to keep a lot of

1540
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,000
information in secret

1541
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,559
therefore we have to open up and i think

1542
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:45,280
that

1543

was mentioned by gerge

1545
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,559

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,240
such information on the international

1547
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,839

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,599
threat information threat intelligence

1555
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,200
joel is about being machine readable

1556
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,720
nowadays we cannot afford to have just

1557
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,520
um

1558
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,040
human agents analyzing everything

1559
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,480
um with regards to internationalization

1560
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,760
uh yes uh it's important but

1561
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,119
i'm going to talk mainly about the

1562
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,400
eu horizon that we do have

1563
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,599
some isaac initiatives

1564
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,640
that they do uh good work but uh we do

1565
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:52,880
it

1566
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,799
even better thank you very much uh

1567
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,920
i agree with you a question uh for

1568
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,040
uh chaba would you or who would you

1569
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,680
motivate private companies to share

1570
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,160
cyber incident related information

1571
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,720
because

1572
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,440
you mentioned it's a very very huge

1573
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,520
problem

1574
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,720
yeah our experience is that the question

1575
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,280
is

1576
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,079
it really belongs to trust therefore in

1577
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,359
the first year of

1578
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,400
the history of sequences uh we had a lot

1579
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,799
of

1580
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,200
personal workshops uh before the covered

1581
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,000
of course

1582
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
uh to build up trust between the

1583
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,520
different actors and they understood

1584
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,000
that they have

1585
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,960
to share as much information as they can

1586
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,359
and

1587
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,280
uh it seems after three years of this

1588
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,720
cooperation it seems that they are

1589
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,960
really open to cooperate

1590
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,359
it's very simple uh currently we know

1591
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,280
each other and we have the trust so

1592
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,280
i would emphasize emphasize again trust

1593
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,359
is the answer for that question

1594
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,400
i see thank you very much so

1595
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,599
