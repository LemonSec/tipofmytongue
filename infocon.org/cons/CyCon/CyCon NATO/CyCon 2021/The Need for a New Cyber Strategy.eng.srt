[Music]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,520
now we'll move on to the final session

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,160
of the day

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
we'll give the floor over to curt giles

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,000
from the conflict studies research

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,360
center in the uk

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,599
for the fireside chat with chairman of

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,760
silverado policy accelerator

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,400
dmitry alperovich the topic of that chat

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,960
will be

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
the need for new cyber strategy and as

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,800
always

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,240
you are more than welcome to post

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
questions using the chat function

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
and also to share your thoughts in

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,000
social media

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
but without further ado gentlemen the

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:45,839
floor is yours

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,399
thank you leona and thank you henrik and

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
it's a great pleasure to to be with you

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
this afternoon i'm so glad we can make

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,320
it

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
we've got very used over the last year

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
and a bit to hearing people saying

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,320
what a great conference but aren't we so

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
much looking forward to actually being

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
in person in the right place but

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
the difference of course with cycon is

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
when people say that you know that they

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,600
actually

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
mean it it will be tremendous when we

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
can finally get together again in

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,880
thailand

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,799
but for now there's no fireside but we

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
will have dmitry alberovich and i'm

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
greatly looking forward to talking over

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
some of the the broader cyber issues

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
that we've been coming up against over

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,759
the last few months and

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,360
pulling out some of the threads from the

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
other conversations we've been hearing

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,240
during cyclon

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200
now mitchell when we spoke the other day

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
you were talking about how you had

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
slightly stepped to the side

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
from cyber issues with your new baby the

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
silverado policy accelerator

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
which is looking at broader topics a

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
great car punk brake power competition

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
that china

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
trade industrial policy the environment

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,320
and so on we'll probably get a chance to

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
talk a little bit about that later on

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,320
but

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
for now the exam question as you just

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
heard is the need for a new cyber

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,719
strategy in fact

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
it wasn't even put as a question there's

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
no question mark on the end it stated

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
there is a need for a new cyber security

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,439
strategy

62
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,360
i want to ask you because a lot of

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
people have got quite exercised lately

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,000
with

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,878
a busy time for cyber things and stuff

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,959
with solarwinds and exchange issues

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
and a lot of people who don't normally

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
engage with cyber issues coming up with

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,920
strong

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
opinions about how we need a new

71
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
approach this is a game changer

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
and everything is broken probably

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
because of the scale and depth of those

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
problems and the false sense of security

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
that people had been lulled

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
into previously but let's start

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
precisely with that issue

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
the statement that we have been posed

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,239
the need for the new um

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,720
the new cyber strategy it's gripped

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
people's imagination this idea how do

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
you feel about it

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
thanks kier for having me and great to

84
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
be at least virtually

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,959
at cycon hope to be soon back in

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,239
thailand in person

87
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
uh what an amazing city always loved

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
going there well

89
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
let me start with um saying that the

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
cyber strategy

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
needs to be rooted in geopolitical

92
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
strategy i coined a phrase

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
over half a decade ago that we don't

94
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,879
have a cyber problem we have a china

95
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
russia iran a north korea problem

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
and that's really more true than ever

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
and it's not to say that most of the

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
attacks that we're seeing

99
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
are nation state-sponsored attacks from

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
those countries we certainly see a lot

101
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,519
of criminal activity such as the

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
colonial pipeline hack that we witnessed

103
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,800
just

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
a few weeks ago however even the

105
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
majority of the cyber crime that we're

106
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,519
seeing

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,400
is emanating from those four countries

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,120
from

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
criminal groups or sometimes state

110
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,519
actors that are allowed to moonlight

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
in this domain or sometimes even

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,799
sponsored

113
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
and harbored by those nation states so

114
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
while not all

115
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
the vast majority of the problem is

116
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
because you have these safe havens where

117
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
cybercrime

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
has been allowed to prosper and and

119
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,280
spread

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
over the course of last couple of

121
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
decades particularly in russia

122
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
and uh but now we're seeing the same

123
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,799
happening in china

124
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,680
and and iran and other places and that's

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,959
the root problem that we need to start

126
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
thinking about how do we address

127
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
how do we confront these nation states

128
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
that pose such a deep threat to us

129
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,200
on the economic espionage front on the

130
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
destructive attack front

131
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
and on the supporting of the cybercrime

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,238
as well

133
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
so that's step number one step number

134
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
two is start thinking about

135
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
a different defensive approach you know

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
we're coming up on almost four decades

137
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
of trying to do the same thing of

138
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
building up better defenses

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
to cyber attacks and things are only

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
keep getting worse right

141
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
one of the first attacks that uh we had

142
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,520
seen was back in the 80s

143
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
the famous cuckoo zag book that was

144
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
written by cliff stahl highlighting the

145
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,639
intrusion

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
of people hired by the then east german

147
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
stasi

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
into american academic networks in order

149
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
to infiltrate the military networks

150
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
and it's just continued on since then

151
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
and the reality is

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
that we need to come to to terms with

153
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
the fact that a capable adversary

154
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,400
particularly an adversary that's

155
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
sponsored by a foreign intelligence

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,039
service

157
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,360
that can use both sigit methods as well

158
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,479
as human efforts

159
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
to infiltrate networks will always be

160
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
able to get in

161
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
that does not mean that they will

162
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
succeed in their objectives but the idea

163
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
that we can keep them out the idea that

164
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
we can train all of our people to

165
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
recognize phishing attacks the idea that

166
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,800
we will never have

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
zero day exploits the idea that everyone

168
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
will patch their systems on time

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
it's just uh not realistic and we have

170
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720
four decades

171
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
almost four decades of proof that it

172
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,479
does not work

173
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,120
will not work and um we need we need a

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,080
different approach

175
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
and the approach really needs to be

176
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
focused on

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,199
how do we assuming that someone is going

178
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,280
to get in stop them from accomplishing

179
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
the objective

180
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
playing to our strengths which is

181
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
understanding our networks

182
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
and being able to recognize an intrusion

183
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,919
once they're there

184
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,199
and preventing them from moving

185
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,560
laterally preventing them from excel

186
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520
trading data

187
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
preventing them from encrypting data

188
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
some of the concepts like xero trust

189
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,080
that we've just now

190
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
started to to apply in network design

191
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
are key to all of this

192
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
but also opera under the assumption of

193
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
assumed breach

194
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
peter thanks i'm so glad that you left

195
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,880
straight in there with that uh that

196
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,360
motto

197
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
i think of yours about how it is not a

198
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
cyber problem but it's a country problem

199
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,080
and yes

200
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
uh taking for granted that we have a

201
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
tactical issue with cyber and a

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
strategic problem with how to deal with

203
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
all of the people that wish to do us

204
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
harm

205
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
but still there is that common

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,520
denominator of all of the issues that

207
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
we're talking about that it is

208
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
a cyber problem and the vector through

209
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
which all of these problems are

210
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
delivered are in fact cyber and

211
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
that's the the issue that i'd like to to

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
drag you back to and you've spoken a

213
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,639
little bit about how

214
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
the current approach isn't working and i

215
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
wonder to what extent it doesn't need a

216
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
more deep and broad reimagining of

217
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
exactly how we can solve these problems

218
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,800
because

219
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,599
we have the systemic issues but we also

220
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,479
have this

221
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
succession of self-inflicted injuries

222
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,520
that make

223
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
the problem worse uh none of the things

224
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,759
that you have just been describing would

225
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
actually necessarily have succeeded

226
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,080
without some own goals by the victim's

227
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,880
side

228
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
we heard president carlyle yesterday uh

229
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,080
saying in her

230
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
very polite being used way that it was

231
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
stunning that solarwinds didn't have

232
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
a chief information security officer or

233
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
a security director on their payroll

234
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,639
despite selling security solutions to

235
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,599
the us government

236
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
and we're still using crude passwords

237
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
and

238
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
just personally this morning i was

239
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
having a long argument with one of my

240
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
financial service providers who

241
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
decided to sign me up for a new app and

242
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
send me the

243
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
username and password in a plain text

244
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,759
email and it was very hard to

245
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,800
convince them that there might be

246
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
anybody out there who would prefer them

247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,520
not to do that

248
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
so we have a human problem as well

249
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
including from the people who we

250
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,319
actually

251
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,240
trust to provide these solutions and

252
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,599
make them work

253
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,440
and it's all to do with the fundamental

254
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
insecurity of so many of the solutions

255
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
we're being provided with

256
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
how do we tackle that in the context of

257
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,879
this new approach that you're talking

258
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,319
about how do we deal with that root

259
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
problem

260
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
you can't er you know the question

261
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
you're posing is how do we fix people

262
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
and you can't of course and without

263
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
commenting on the specifics of

264
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
uh you know i'm not going to defend

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
whether so um the fact that solarwinds

266
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
didn't have a ciso

267
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,879
but when you look at the sophistication

268
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
of that attack i guarantee you 99

269
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,400
of the software providers of critical

270
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
software to

271
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
us government like solarwinds would fall

272
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
prey to that whether they have a cso or

273
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
not whether they

274
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,839
use password one two three or not um the

275
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
reality is the attack

276
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
was conducted in such a sophisticated

277
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
way in memory only modifying source code

278
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,279
on the fly

279
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,480
to inject the back door in real time

280
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
very very few organizations out there

281
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
would have been able to detect it and

282
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
stop it in time

283
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,480
so you're going to continue to have

284
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
these supply chain attacks and the

285
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
reality is that it's not the first time

286
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
we've seen one

287
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
uh there's a great article in wired um

288
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
just about a week ago

289
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
talking about the rsa attack that we're

290
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
coming up on the 10th year anniversary

291
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,640
of

292
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
um that was one of the first supply

293
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,800
chain hacks we had seen

294
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
where they had broken into rsa to steal

295
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
their seed values that they can use then

296
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
to compromise two-factor authentication

297
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
and get into companies like lockheed

298
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
we have seen lots and lots of those

299
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
attacks apathy was another

300
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
example of it so the idea that you're

301
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
going to stop them all

302
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
by better training or hiring more csos

303
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
or what have you

304
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
it's just ludicrous it will never happen

305
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,399
and you need to assume that your vendors

306
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
will get compromised

307
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
and sometimes their updates will contin

308
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,959
you can

309
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
have back doors that you will deploy in

310
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,160
your network

311
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
what you need to do is assume that they

312
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
will get there

313
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
and how do you operate under that

314
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
assumption will actually succeed

315
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
at stopping the adversary from achieving

316
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
their objective

317
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
great so scoping the problems into those

318
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
we can fix and those we can't which

319
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
covers a broad sector of the problem

320
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
thanks for injecting that uh that note

321
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,279
of optimism

322
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
uh let me come back to the two big

323
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
issues that uh that we've touched on

324
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,760
the solar winds and the exchange it

325
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
struck me as um

326
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
surprisingly slightly that one of those

327
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
got far far more

328
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
engagement and uh capturing people's

329
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
imagination solar winds

330
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
than exchange which seemed to uh by

331
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
contrast pass by rather quietly

332
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
what do you think lies behind this very

333
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
different approach to the two issues and

334
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,640
the very different reaction

335
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
that they've engendered not just from

336
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
professionals it seems but also from

337
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,200
politicians in the public

338
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
you know that's a great question kier

339
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
and and something i've been puzzled over

340
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
uh in over the last few months in fact i

341
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,560
read an article for laffer

342
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
specifically contrasting the solarwinds

343
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
operation versus the

344
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
exchange hacks by china and it strikes

345
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
me that

346
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
to the extent that we want russia to do

347
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
any hacking whatsoever

348
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
solarwinds is a precisely example of the

349
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
type of operation

350
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
we would want them to continue

351
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
conducting versus all the other ones

352
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,160
that we

353
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,959
we had seen from them it was very

354
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,160
targeted

355
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,800
very precise limited collateral damage

356
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,839
even though

357
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
uh through the solarwinds back door they

358
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,360
managed to infect

359
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
tens of thousands of victims they

360
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,959
actually voluntarily shut down their

361
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,320
access permanently shut down their

362
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,959
access

363
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,320
to 99 of the victims only focusing

364
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
on the targets that they're cared about

365
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
government networks

366
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,760
and other it and security fund firms

367
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,800
that they could use

368
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
for follow-on supply chain hacks um so

369
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,079
very

370
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,760
um precise and very carefully executed

371
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,640
operation

372
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
focused on espionage no data was

373
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
destroyed

374
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
no data was manipulated as far as we

375
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
know um

376
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
you know we're not going to stop nation

377
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
states like russia and others

378
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079
conducting espionage because we we do it

379
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,519
against them as well

380
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,200
it's sort of a norm that everyone

381
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,560
accepts um

382
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
both in cyber and traditional physical

383
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
world

384
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
so um that's the type of operation that

385
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
to the extent again you you want the

386
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
russians to do anything that would be

387
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
the one that you would want to

388
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
for them to continue doing versus the

389
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
not patches versus the

390
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
election interference versus the uh you

391
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,120
know

392
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,320
um uh other uh ransomware attacks that

393
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
are coming out of cyber crime

394
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
groups operating in russia and it

395
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
strikes me that hammering russia for the

396
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
solarwinds operation is

397
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,680
counterproductive

398
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
because you're just telling them that we

399
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
will not accept anything that you do in

400
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,920
cyber

401
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,480
even when it's uh targeted espionage

402
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
operations and we're gonna

403
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,920
institute sanctions against you and the

404
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,399
like and that that i think sends a wrong

405
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:26,880
message

406
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
now contrast that with the exchange hack

407
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
which was not precise which was not

408
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
targeted

409
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,399
which um the chinese literally scanned

410
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,760
the entire world

411
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
looking for vulnerable exchange servers

412
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
hacked virtually all of them

413
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
and not only hacked them but actually

414
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,959
opened them up via web shelves for other

415
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,160
groups to come in

416
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
and execute ransomware operations and

417
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
like against those victims

418
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,920
so completely reckless and and

419
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
disruptive and yet we still have not

420
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,839
done as u.s government anything in

421
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
response to that attack so

422
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
um i i hope that the us government will

423
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
take a strong position on on the

424
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
half-name exchange

425
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
operation and that we institute

426
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
sanctions and other measures against

427
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,680
china

428
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,240
for that to to to at a minimum keep some

429
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,279
balance here

430
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
uh but uh from the media perspective i

431
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
think the fact that it was russia doing

432
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,399
solar winds

433
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
i'm sure had a lot to do with um uh the

434
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
public's attention being so captured

435
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,279
uh by that by that by that hack

436
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,800
well that's an interesting side topic

437
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,040
isn't it and uh it's been commented that

438
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,839
in a way the

439
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
the two actors have flipped approaches

440
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,040
between the

441
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,880
bull in a china shop or not carrying who

442
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
you alert and the very precise tailored

443
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,639
covert approach russian china have

444
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,519
switched sides

445
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,959
and there's of course been some informed

446
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
commentary that a lot of that is down to

447
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,040
who

448
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,360
precisely on the russian state side is

449
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,800
actually carrying out the attack and the

450
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,360
different

451
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
operating styles that they have that's a

452
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,959
point i'd like to uh to bring you back

453
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,639
to in a few minutes if i may but

454
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,920
in the meantime we've had a question

455
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
come in from the audience which is on a

456
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,880
similar topic

457
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
that you were just raising the assume

458
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
breach strategy and my apologies to the

459
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
audience i can't actually see

460
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,000
on our system who posed the question so

461
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
this is anonymous but uh

462
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
uh audience member asks me three how

463
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
would an assume breach strategy work for

464
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
the people and organizations that

465
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
haven't been able to teach

466
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
to patch their systems in four decades

467
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,240
isn't the current level of maturity too

468
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,279
low for that

469
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
our audience member asks how would you

470
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
fix that user problem for this new

471
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
strategy you're talking about

472
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
well that strategy is exactly the design

473
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,160
for that problem

474
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
you're not going to patch your way out

475
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
of this problem like uh

476
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
the the the reality is that most

477
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
organizations are not able to patch

478
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,279
timely

479
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
for a wide variety of reasons part of it

480
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,639
is resources part of it is

481
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
being able to take systems out of

482
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,959
production at key moments in time

483
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,639
you know many companies for example in

484
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,320
the retail sector and transportation

485
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,199
sector

486
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
shut down all patching operations except

487
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,639
the most critical ones

488
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,760
from basically october 1st till the end

489
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,240
of the year

490
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,160
because of the shipping and and and um

491
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,560
other loads that they're experiencing um

492
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
related to the holiday season

493
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
um in the us and in europe so uh for a

494
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
variety of business operations they

495
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,199
cannot patch

496
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,760
and and by the way um even um if you

497
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
patch everything you will still have the

498
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,399
zero day issue

499
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
um where you know many capable actors

500
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,240
are able to find vulnerabilities

501
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
that uh you would never be able to patch

502
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
because no patch exists

503
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
so the the idea here is don't waste your

504
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,360
time

505
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
trying to patch and and thinking that

506
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
that's going to solve everything yes

507
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
of course patching is a good thing and

508
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,240
try to do it but

509
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
much better from a resource allocation

510
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,360
perspective

511
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
to spend most of your effort assuming

512
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
that someone's going to get in

513
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
they're going to get in because you

514
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
didn't patch they're going to get in

515
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
because they found a zero day

516
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
that you weren't even aware of they're

517
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
going to get in because if there's a

518
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
back door

519
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
in one of your software tools like

520
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
solarwinds they're going to get in

521
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,639
because it's an insider

522
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,240
there's a million ways that they can get

523
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
in they will get in

524
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
assume that they're there and try to

525
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
find them and stop them before they

526
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
accomplish their objective that's

527
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
where we need to spend the vast majority

528
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,759
of our efforts and by the way it's

529
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,880
analogous to what we do in

530
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
counterintelligence right we do not

531
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
assume

532
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
in intelligence communities in the us or

533
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
europe that

534
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,279
or frankly in in our adversary countries

535
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,079
as well

536
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
that um a capable nation state will not

537
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
be able to recruit a source inside

538
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,079
inside of the intelligence community in

539
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,680
fact if you look at the history of just

540
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
in the u.s alone

541
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,800
we have to assume at any given moment in

542
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,399
time we have foreign spies working in

543
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,759
our intelligence community we have

544
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
literally a hundred year history

545
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
of finding them in every decade

546
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,920
since that and what we do is we try to

547
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
identify them not by stopping them from

548
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,639
coming in

549
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
obviously we do some efforts polygraphs

550
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
background checks and like

551
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,480
we assume that those will fail and we

552
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
continuously try to

553
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
uh look for suspicious activities

554
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,639
check people's finances for any unusual

555
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
bank receipts and the like to to find

556
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,079
them once they're in

557
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
we need to take the same approach in

558
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
cyber and spend most of our efforts

559
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
finding them assuming that they're

560
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
already there

561
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
well this all makes sense let me uh zoom

562
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,039
out just a tiny bit i think the

563
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
the question may have been taking

564
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,559
patching really is an example

565
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,079
of of cultural shifts that are

566
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,679
incredibly difficult to bring

567
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
into the broader user environment and i

568
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
think it might be more about

569
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,319
that cultural problem overall yes

570
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,280
assumed breach

571
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,599
of the the specialist perhaps can uh can

572
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,559
cope with that

573
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,199
how will the public the users the

574
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
politicians in particular

575
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
adjust to that new mentality uh i

576
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
mentioned a moment ago that uh part of

577
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,440
the

578
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
this resonance that the the solarwinds

579
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
hack uh has

580
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
sparked among society seems to be

581
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,640
because there was this assumption of

582
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,840
security beforehand

583
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
that this sort of thing ought not to be

584
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
possible how do we go about first of all

585
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,919
challenging that and then bringing this

586
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,280
new attitude

587
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
in that is the essential bedrock for

588
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
that new kind of approach to security

589
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,919
that you're talking about

590
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,360
where would you start it's such a great

591
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
question because i

592
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
i honestly don't know what it would take

593
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
in terms of how many headlines like

594
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
solarwinds like not patria

595
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,600
like the ransomware hacks that we're

596
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
seeing on a daily basis for people to

597
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:07,919
stop

598
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
assuming that their systems are secure

599
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,120
uh

600
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,320
another phrase i coined uh over a decade

601
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,039
ago

602
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,600
uh was that we um there are only two

603
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,120
types of companies those that know that

604
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,320
they've been hacked and those that don't

605
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,039
yet know

606
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,600
but they've all been hacked and uh at

607
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,039
the time i got a lot of criticism for

608
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,360
that

609
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
uh were you talking about obviously 10

610
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,039
years later it's become much more

611
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,400
apparent that indeed

612
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,080
uh it's very hard to find an

613
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
organization out there that has not been

614
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,400
penetrated

615
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
and and penetrated often multiple times

616
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
uh but the reality is that those systems

617
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,160
are not secure they will never be secure

618
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
i believe it was robert morris the

619
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,200
senior

620
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
that uh going to joke back in the 80s

621
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
that there are only

622
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
three things you have to do to secure

623
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,760
your your computer

624
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
uh one is don't plug it uh plug it into

625
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
the network

626
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
two don't turn it on three don't buy a

627
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
computer and you'll be perfectly secure

628
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,600
uh i mean there's some truth to that in

629
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
that you will not

630
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
have perfect security people will

631
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
continue to find vulnerabilities

632
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
sometimes in the humans that operate

633
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
those systems

634
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
sometimes in the systems themselves

635
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,440
they'll exploit them they will get in

636
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
and you need to shift resources and this

637
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
is fundamentally

638
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
an allocation of resources issue most of

639
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
your resources need to be spent

640
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
on trying to find people that already

641
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
inside and kicking them out as rapidly

642
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,600
as possible

643
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
focusing on speed in order to win not on

644
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
building walls trying to prevent them

645
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
from coming in

646
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
some effort on prevention is important

647
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
but it cannot be

648
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
99 of the allocation that that it is

649
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
today

650
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,280
well it seems that answer to that

651
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
question of um after four decades how

652
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
many headlines does it take to change

653
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,440
attitudes that

654
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
seems to answer itself because it looks

655
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
like the answer is not in the headlines

656
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,080
since they don't have that effect

657
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
and as well as companies uh either

658
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,679
knowing they've been hacked or not

659
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,120
knowing yet that they've been hacked

660
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
seems the same with people there is no

661
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
substitute at the moment for

662
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
learning the hard way which again is not

663
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
a particularly optimistic conclusion but

664
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,799
something we we need to grapple with

665
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,720
let me bring you back to that issue of

666
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
the different threat

667
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
actors and the different ways in which

668
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,120
we need to

669
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
assume threats are going to be coming

670
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,559
from from different directions now

671
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,240
you talked about a baseline strategy

672
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
which is a kind of one-size-fits-all for

673
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,520
dealing with the threat

674
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,240
overall but what about considering those

675
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,120
differences

676
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,159
in both methods and objectives for

677
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
the four actors that you named china

678
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,360
iran

679
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,280
north korea russia what is it

680
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,960
specifically and of course breaking down

681
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
within those the different uh

682
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
attitudes for example from the giu the

683
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
svr the fsb within russia

684
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
and their counterparts elsewhere where

685
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,039
do you think the most

686
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
interesting and difficult cyber threats

687
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
come from if you look across that

688
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
landscape of the people who wish to do

689
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
us harm

690
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
you know i have a very contrarian view

691
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
on this gear and that is

692
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,080
that north korea i believe is the most

693
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
creative actor out of

694
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
any of them they've really pioneered a

695
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
lot of the attacks that we're now seeing

696
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
being adopted by other threat actors

697
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
they were the first ones to do

698
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
destructive attacks from a nation-state

699
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,400
perspective

700
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,799
back in the mid 2000s as they were

701
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,000
starting to do operations

702
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
against south korea and using wiper

703
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
malware that was then adopted by the

704
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,559
iranians

705
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,320
and the russians they were the first

706
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,919
ones to do a dump and

707
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,039
and um leak operation um

708
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
you know we we often think that the

709
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
russians were the first ones to do it in

710
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,919
the 2016 elections

711
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
but the sony hack was actually the

712
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
original example of stealing emails

713
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,960
and then leaking into wikileaks for for

714
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,159
publication

715
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
which was very effective at destroying

716
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,600
um a number

717
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
reputations of a number of executives

718
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,440
within sony that i'm sure

719
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
did not go unnoticed in moscow when they

720
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
were conducting their

721
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
election interference operations uh

722
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
about a year and a half later

723
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,880
um they were the first ones to really

724
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
engage in

725
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,880
cybercrime on a massive scale um

726
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
uh breaking into banks breaking into

727
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
cryptocurrency exchanges stealing lots

728
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
of money to finance the regime

729
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
so a lot of the things that we're now

730
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
seeing from other nation states

731
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
the north koreans pioneered and their

732
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
technical sophistication

733
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
is very good they've been

734
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
honing their skills on south korea for

735
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
almost two decades now using sort of a

736
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,559
free fire test range and

737
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,799
over time expanding to other targets

738
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
across the globe

739
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
so um there there are a force to be

740
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,360
reckoned with for sure

741
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
and yes somehow they've done all of this

742
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,360
while at the same time remaining

743
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
under most people's radar you talk to

744
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
people about where the cyber threats

745
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
come from and they might mention

746
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
china russia and if they think about it

747
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,440
a bit iran and then way down the field

748
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
comes north korea so

749
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
i think that's a bonus points for

750
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,559
pyongyang as well for actually making

751
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,000
sure that nobody's has them at the front

752
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
of their mind while doing all of this

753
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
but in the the rsa keynote

754
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
not so long ago you you mentioned that

755
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
the biggest threat is not actually

756
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,960
the nation states but ransomware and i

757
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
wondered if you could uh pull that apart

758
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,360
so

759
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
is that really a separate problem from

760
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,679
the nation states that might want to

761
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,480
condone to encourage to allow ransomware

762
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,679
attacks to be launched from their

763
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,320
territory

764
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,919
can we actually really split it out like

765
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
that or is it is it again

766
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,320
coming down to the approaches that we

767
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
need to take across the board in order

768
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,880
to protect

769
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
ourselves on a systemic level yeah great

770
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,039
question by the way

771
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
i made that statement that ransomware

772
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
was the top threat before the colonial

773
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,880
hack so

774
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,240
uh uh i'll take some credit uh for

775
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,280
highlighting it before

776
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
it was even top of mind for many people

777
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
outside of the

778
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,760
cyber industry but the um um

779
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,159
no i i think when you look at where most

780
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,600
of the ransomware is coming from

781
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
not all of it but most of it it's coming

782
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
from russia it's coming from criminals

783
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,120
operating within the russian gov

784
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
within the russian federation many of

785
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
them known to the russian government

786
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
many of them

787
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
uh harbored by the russian government

788
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,159
some of them over the years have been

789
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
identified by u.s law enforcement they

790
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
have provided evidence to russian law

791
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,159
enforcement and nothing has been done

792
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
no arrests no investigations no

793
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
prosecution so the only thing

794
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,919
that you can extrapolate from that is

795
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
the russian government is at a minimum

796
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
completely uninterested

797
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
in prosecuting cyber crime within its

798
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
borders when evidence is brought to it

799
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
and at a maximum is actively supporting

800
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,279
and encouraging those types of

801
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,159
activities

802
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,039
so yes uh while there's no evidence that

803
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,720
the russian government itself

804
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
is involved in ransomware operations the

805
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
fact that they are allowing these groups

806
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,520
to operate within their borders um even

807
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
when they know about them

808
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,679
and have been provided evidence uh

809
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
highlights how big of a problem

810
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,799
russia itself is as as a purveyor

811
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
of ransomware that is absolutely right

812
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,520
and it's a point that

813
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,760
we've been trying to get across for for

814
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
a decade or more

815
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
that all of the conversations about

816
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
whether the russian state is actually

817
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,360
complicit

818
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,120
in attacks coming from its territory

819
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
whether there is a direct line on the

820
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
org chart from the kremlin to the cyber

821
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,840
criminal

822
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,080
really misses the point that if if

823
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
russia did not want this stuff to happen

824
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
they would find it really

825
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
straightforward to stop it and therefore

826
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,080
we should be having the conversation

827
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
from a completely

828
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
different angle now we're not seeing

829
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
many uh uh

830
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
questions coming in from the audience at

831
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,440
the moment i think they're probably too

832
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
busy uh

833
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
studying your book shelf and your coin

834
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,679
rack to see

835
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
where you've been and who you're reading

836
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
please do audience members send in some

837
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,279
more questions while we have still

838
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
five minutes left to put them to meet

839
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
three but in the meantime while we're

840
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,840
waiting for anybody to

841
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
come up with anything exciting and

842
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
challenging let's

843
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,279
take a step sideways again from cyber

844
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,720
now the issue you're working

845
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,840
on at the moment is related but separate

846
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,000
and it's another big challenge that you

847
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,279
and silverado see

848
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,880
at the moment and it is the

849
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,799
semiconductor crisis and i wonder if you

850
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,480
can tell us a little bit about that and

851
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,600
specifically how you see that affecting

852
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,159
our

853
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,919
current area of interest what does that

854
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,679
actually mean with a short

855
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,039
and long term and how are we going to

856
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
deal with it

857
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
well i'll make a statement that's a

858
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,360
little bit uh strange for cyberperson

859
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
the one the one i spent 25 years working

860
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,799
in this field to say

861
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
but i believe the the top national

862
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
security problem

863
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,840
in technology today is not cyber it is

864
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,080
semiconductors

865
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,520
and um uh we often say

866
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,240
um in the semiconductor world that

867
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
semiconductor is the new oil

868
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
and that's actually the wrong way to

869
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
think about it because at least there

870
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
are replacements for oil there's

871
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,559
renewable energy there's gas there's

872
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,559
all kinds of other things that you can

873
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,400
use to to produce energy

874
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
there is no replacement for

875
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,559
semiconductors and we're seeing that now

876
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,520
with the shortage that we're

877
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
experiencing at the moment

878
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,159
it's impacting car sales it's impacting

879
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,520
home sales because

880
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
in a bunch of places in the u.s right

881
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
now new construction cannot be finished

882
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
because they're missing microwaves

883
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,919
they're missing washers and dryers that

884
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,760
you have to buy code put in

885
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
before you can finalize construction and

886
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
they can't procure those items

887
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
because of a semiconductor shortage

888
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
they're literally in everything that we

889
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
use today from your coffee maker to your

890
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
computer to your iphone

891
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,679
and one there is a shortage today that

892
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
that's mostly

893
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,159
covet related and a huge spike in in

894
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:22,960
demand

895
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,559
but the biggest strategic threat over

896
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
the long term is that the vast majority

897
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,080
of semiconductors

898
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,480
both the leading edge semiconductors the

899
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
five seven nanometers

900
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,559
um that you use in your iphones and your

901
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
cloud computing and your ai applications

902
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,039
as well as the so-called trailing edge

903
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,120
semiconductors the older technology

904
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,840
nodes

905
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,399
like the 65 nanometer the the 28

906
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,360
nanometers

907
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,440
they're used in cars they're used in tvs

908
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
they're used in lots and lots of other

909
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
things

910
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
they're mostly coming from one company

911
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,399
tsmc that is located in taiwan

912
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,440
taiwan happens to be 100 miles

913
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
across the taiwanese straits from china

914
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,440
if something happens to taiwan

915
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,799
an invasion a blockade or even a weather

916
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,320
event like a typhoon

917
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,720
or a drought semiconductor manufacturing

918
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,559
uses a lot of oil and there's actually

919
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
drought in taiwan right now

920
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
that is having some impact on production

921
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
capacity for tsmc

922
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,679
that will have global implica

923
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,520
implications and a lasting

924
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,080
uh shortage of semiconductors will have

925
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,799
devastating

926
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,919
impact on global economy so um this is

927
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,360
one of the key issues that we're working

928
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,279
on at silverado in addition to cyber in

929
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,000
addition some other

930
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
things that we need to diversify our

931
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
supply chain on semiconductors

932
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
we need to bring more of it to the u.s

933
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
but we also need to work with allies we

934
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,240
need to bring more of it to europe

935
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,559
to south korea to japan to other

936
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,440
partners

937
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
so that there is not one chokepoint in

938
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,799
taiwan

939
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,279
for this supercritical technology and

940
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,080
frankly

941
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,480
you know the best way to solve cyber is

942
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
to not have semiconductors because

943
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
nothing will work

944
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,919
and we'll all be perfectly secure but

945
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,880
we'll also be

946
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
living back in the stone ages so a

947
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
potentially huge problem with one which

948
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,240
is

949
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
even more remote from public

950
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,039
consciousness than all of the cyber

951
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,960
issues we were talking about before

952
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
we are close to time but we have had

953
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
another audience question come in

954
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
and it is a classic it is one that uh we

955
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
have heard chewed over at great length

956
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,039
at

957
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
successive cycons ever since they

958
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,200
started running in 2009

959
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
and it's the attribution one but a

960
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,240
specific take on on attribution and i

961
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,880
suspect

962
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
you may have a a brief potted answer to

963
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,880
this that you can fit into the remaining

964
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
90 seconds or so that we have i'll read

965
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
the question to you it's what sort of

966
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
standards of proof should be required

967
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,799
for official attribution and sanctions

968
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,559
is there a problem that media and other

969
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,720
private interests may attribute

970
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,559
on shaky grounds that influence the

971
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,159
public opinion i suspect you have some

972
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
well-developed thoughts on that so let's

973
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
round off the session with with that

974
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,520
thanks demetri

975
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
that's a great question so look i i

976
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,520
think there there have to be multiple

977
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,240
standards for

978
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
for attribution if you're going to go

979
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,919
into a court of law and prosecute

980
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,480
someone

981
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
uh for for a cyber attack obviously you

982
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
need a very high

983
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,159
degree of proof beyond a reasonable

984
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,520
doubt to convict them at least in the

985
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,720
u.s

986
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,039
court when it comes to public opinion

987
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,760
the the

988
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
level of proof is much lower and it has

989
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,960
always been that way cyber is not

990
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,840
special

991
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,799
look at uh you know the allegations uh

992
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,200
about

993
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,640
uh russian poisonings in salisbury

994
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,679
or you know the gru operations all over

995
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,840
europe or the poisoning of navalny

996
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
or the allegations about use of chemical

997
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
weapons in syria a wide variety of

998
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,320
things that we accuse foreign states of

999
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,200
doing

1000
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,760
and sanction them for those efforts we

1001
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,799
don't reveal

1002
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,440
um all the evidence we is in the us

1003
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,240
government

1004
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,159
for how we arrive at that some of it is

1005
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
based i'm sure on very sensitive

1006
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,640
intelligence

1007
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
uh somewhat is not but um we leave it up

1008
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,320
to

1009
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
to the courts to actually dig into the

1010
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
details of that but this

1011
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
the standard that the nation states have

1012
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,000
used

1013
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
for taking action against other nation

1014
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,519
states have always been low

1015
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
in in the uh international relations

1016
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,440
realm and and will continue to do so and

1017
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
cyber is no special

1018
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
great dmitry we could carry on talking

1019
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
about all of those issues for hours but

1020
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,159
we are

1021
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,320
unfortunately at times so we'll have to

1022
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,200
park it there and

1023
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,279
hand back to henrik and lina it's been

1024
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,720
great chatting and i hope to see you

1025
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480

so thank you gentlemen for uh for

1028
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,360
allowing us to follow your truly

1029
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,480
interesting discussion

1030
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
um it would appear that we are indeed in

1031
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
need of improving our cyber strategies

1032
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,320
which is of course something that we

1033
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,640
should constantly strive to improve

1034
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,600
um and acting as if your opponents

1035
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,120
already in your systems

1036
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,440
or in our systems may indeed be an

1037
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,519
approach worth pursuing

1038
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,120
but this rounds up uh today's topics

1039
