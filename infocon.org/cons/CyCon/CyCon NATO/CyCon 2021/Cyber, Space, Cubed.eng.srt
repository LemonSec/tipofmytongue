2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,000
so

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
good afternoon and many many thanks to

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,360
the

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
cycon team for a great three days so my

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
name is p cooper and i'm honored to be

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,279
here with a great panel

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
that's right at the cutting edge and

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,599
crossover of two areas which are

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,279
absolutely critical to us

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,320
which is cyber security and space

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,399
we're fully dependent on both and when

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,000
we look at where they overlap there are

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,920
some really fascinating and pressing

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
challenges

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
and i'm and i'm honored that throughout

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
my career i've been able to

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,399
keep a handle on be involved in both

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,840
through either being involved in for

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,600
example the shreve war games or being

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
involved in

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
the aerospace village at defcon and

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,480
working with the

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
the great hacker community industry and

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,160
different governments about

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,520
how do we look at the cyber security of

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
our space assets

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,800
and when we look at the growth of our

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
connected digital ecosystem

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,320
we can see that right across all of our

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
sectors the challenges of

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,600
securing what we value against our

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
adversaries that are resource innovative

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,720
and determined

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,119
is that there's nothing off limits and a

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
satellite is literally just a digital

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
connected computer that happens to be

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
physically inaccessible

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
just because it's in orbit and there's

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
been a significant growth in that space

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,119
sector both in launch vehicles and

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
payloads and satellites

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
now isn't just nation states that we are

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
seeing such a diversity of stakeholders

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,280
getting involved

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,960
because that now ranges from commercial

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
to academic

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,479
so innovation in both satellites and

49
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,159
launch vehicles is now bringing down the

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
cost of getting payloads into orbit

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
and it's now no longer one payload to

52
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
one rocket or one launch vehicle

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
if there is a physical space and launch

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,000
vehicle that can be sold to multiple

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
stakeholders for multiple payloads to

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
reduce costs

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
so as an example spacex even on their

58
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
recent starlink deployment had two

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,200
rideshare

60
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
satellites or payloads and then another

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,079
rocket earlier this year had 143

62
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,280
satellites on board so the world of

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,479
getting payloads into orbit has

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
completely changed

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
but what does this look like what does

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
this mean if we look at it through

67
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,639
our cyber and adversarial lens so this

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
panel is going to start exploring that

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
that overlap of space and cyber security

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
and where those challenges can multiply

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,840
so science space cubed so how much trust

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
is required to strap somebody else's

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
satellite to your rocket

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
in this panel we're going to delve into

75
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
those questions and then what that means

76
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,160
across the intersection of cyber

77
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
security

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
space collaboration and risk

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
we're going to start with a presentation

80
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
from james

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
the paper that he and the team oxford

82
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
have written exploring a novel threat

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,360
model that

84
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,879
targets some of these implicit trust

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
assumptions when we're looking at our

86
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,239
multi-stakeholder

87
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
space community and then that

88
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,480
presentation will be used as a launch

89
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,319
pad for an open discussion

90
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,160
on challenges in securing these new

91
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
space missions

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
the tensions between the interstate

93
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
collaboration competition in orbit

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
and also the evolving role of both

95
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
technologists and policy makers

96
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,239
interested in defending that final

97
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,120
frontier

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,319
and how we need to actually work

99
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,239
together to achieve those

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
secure and trusted partnerships we're

101
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,840
looking for

102
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
so as an intro to james so james savor

103
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,959
is a b

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
phil student and a rhodes scholar oxford

105
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
university's department of computer

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
science

107
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
and his research focuses on satellite

108
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,080
cyber security and ways to secure

109
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
modern systems and modern space missions

110
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
from emerging trends

111
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
and what's great is i keep bumping into

112
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
him and his great work either at the

113
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,799
aerospace village at defcon

114
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,239
or the cyber strategy competition i

115
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
founded at the uk and it's great to

116
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
see him here at cyclon and i'm going to

117
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,519
pass over to him for a great

118
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,319
presentation

119
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,239
on the research he and the team came up

120
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
with before the panel thank you

121
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
thanks so i'm

122
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
really excited to be presenting today

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
and kind of starting off this panel

124
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
talking about some research that we've

125
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
been doing in partnership with arma

126
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,080
swiss

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,640
looking at a really exciting topic which

128
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,599
is this

129
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,640
rocket launches and in particular what's

130
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
happening at the top of

131
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
this tube full of fire and this image

132
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
here is from the european space

133
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
agency's vega mission which launched

134
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
last year and carried 53

135
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,640
satellites on a shared journey towards

136
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,720
the stars and if we peel back the

137
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,080
payload fairing at the top of that

138
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
rocket and look inside

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
we see a really complicated and

140
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,918
fascinating global world

141
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,800
we see satellites from giant u.s tech

142
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,360
companies

143
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
like facebook we see research projects

144
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,280
whether that's from a

145
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
university in tullen or a nuclear

146
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
physics institute in moscow

147
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
we see startups in argentina slovenia

148
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
israel all involved in this rocket we

149
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
even see governments the thai air force

150
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,240
was

151
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
sending a satellite on this same vehicle

152
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
with all these other people and if you

153
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
think about the relationships between

154
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
these states and these entities

155
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
you can understand that there's some

156
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
significant trust dynamics

157
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
involved in sharing this journey to

158
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
space today we're going to look a little

159
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
bit at threat models in that domain and

160
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
what happens if one of these

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,880
participants

162
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
is malicious and wants to somehow

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
compromise or undermine the security of

164
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,160
the space mission

165
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
maybe by inserting their own payload

166
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,240
with hidden behaviors in its code

167
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
or by manipulating the behavior of

168
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
someone else's payload

169
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
so that it can cause harm to the overall

170
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
operation

171
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,479
before i get too into that threat

172
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
modeling though it's important to have a

173
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
basic understanding

174
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,759
of why states and companies are doing

175
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,840
this ride sharing thing at all

176
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
so if we imagine that you're a satellite

177
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
operator and you want to launch your

178
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
satellite into space

179
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
the first thing you'll do is acquire a

180
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
rocket or a launch vehicle and we'll say

181
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,479
it costs like 150 million dollars

182
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
you put your satellite on it and then

183
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
you realize there's a problem here

184
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
which is that you're not really using

185
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
all of this enormous expensive rocket

186
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,479
your satellite

187
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,919
isn't heavy enough to push it to the

188
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
maximum of its capacity

189
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,280
so you call up your friends in the space

190
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
industry and you say hey i've got this

191
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
rocket i'm launching

192
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,000
any chance you want to hitch a ride and

193
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
your friends will

194
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
split the cost with you and attach their

195
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,400
secondary payloads

196
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,360
to your rockets we've gotten really good

197
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,919
at this

198
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
cost splitting sharing model in

199
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
particular we've been

200
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
developing smaller and smaller

201
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
satellites over the past decades

202
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
called nanosats or cubesats some of them

203
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
are literally the size of a rubik's cube

204
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
and we can basically just keep cramming

205
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
these on into rockets until we've used

206
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
up all of the available space

207
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,120
and launch capacity and this is a win

208
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
for everyone involved

209
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
the cubesat owners would be absolutely

210
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,520
it would be absolutely absurd for them

211
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
to spend 150 million dollars to launch

212
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
their rubik's cube worth of computing

213
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,280
components into space

214
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
so they're able to send these smaller

215
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
cheaper experimental projects

216
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
at a cost that otherwise would have been

217
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
impossible meanwhile the larger

218
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
operators can subsidize the cost of

219
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
their space missions

220
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
by selling out this wholesale launch

221
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
capacity they have

222
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
cutting into their own risk and

223
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
increasing their ability to innovate and

224
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,280
launch

225
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,160
new satellites today we're going to look

226
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
at what happens if one of these

227
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
smaller cheaper payloads is malicious

228
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
in some way and in particular what we're

229
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,800
going to be

230
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,039
looking at here is what someone could do

231
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,800
with the cubesat to harm the safety of

232
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,599
the overall

233
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
launch mission now there are a couple of

234
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
reasons in

235
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
the paper that we published in the cycon

236
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,919
proceedings

237
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
that kind of talk about why someone

238
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
would want to start with cubesats

239
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
the most obvious is that they're fairly

240
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,199
easy to develop exploits against

241
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,479
compared to

242
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
more traditional satellites because your

243
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
very big satellites are going to be

244
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,000
bespoke kind of one-of-a-kind projects

245
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
whereas cubesats are going to use

246
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,039
components that are purchased from a

247
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
handful of commercial off-the-shelf

248
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
vendors

249
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,039
and so an attacker might be able to also

250
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,479
purchase those components and start

251
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
designing exploits and

252
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
figuring out vulnerabilities in those

253
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
systems this commercial off-the-shelf

254
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
supply chain is also relatively

255
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
vulnerable

256
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,919
the components might be able to have

257
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
hardware back doors inserted into them

258
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
in a way that a one-of-a-kind part

259
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
manufactured by boeing or lockheed

260
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
is not really going to be as susceptible

261
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
to

262
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
additionally the organizations building

263
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,160
these devices

264
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
are not necessarily terribly experienced

265
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
at defending against cyber adversaries

266
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,360
we're talking about

267
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
a lot of very small space tech startups

268
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,479
or

269
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,800
universities and you can imagine a

270
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
university that would take a visiting

271
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
researcher for example working for

272
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
another country's espionage

273
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
wing and not recognize it and that kind

274
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,599
of insider threat

275
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
is incredibly difficult for these actors

276
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,039
to defend against

277
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
especially when you compare that with

278
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
defense contractors and the bigger

279
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,120
aerospace entities

280
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
who are at least aware of and working on

281
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
these threats however all three of these

282
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,599
things

283
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
might not matter if you're a nation

284
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
state and you want to use a cubesat

285
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
to harm a rocket because cubesats are

286
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
relatively cheap you can spend

287
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,080
a couple hundred thousand a couple

288
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
million dollars building a malicious

289
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,399
cubesat and potentially be able to reap

290
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
billions of dollars in harm and

291
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
reputational damage

292
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,399
against an adversary and if you fail the

293
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
risk of failure is very low because all

294
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,160
of the forensic evidence of your attack

295
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
is floating somewhere hundreds or

296
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
thousands of miles

297
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
above the earth's surface and will

298
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,519
probably never be found

299
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
so let's go ahead and deal with one

300
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
problem here which is that yeah you

301
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
might be able to compromise and build a

302
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
malicious cubesat

303
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
but what can you do with it this quote

304
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
here is

305
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,000
very common in the space industry and

306
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
it's not

307
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
wrong um cubesats are largely useless

308
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,959
devices for an attacker

309
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
they don't have maneuvering capabilities

310
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
you can't like crash them into things

311
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
they're very low power which means that

312
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
you're not really going to be able to do

313
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
a lot in terms of either causing like

314
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
kinetic explosive damage or

315
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
even in terms of like transmitting stuff

316
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
and the hardware on there is not very

317
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
novel or interesting it's going to be

318
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
mostly like cameras and antennas these

319
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
aren't sophisticated devices

320
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
compared to larger satellites however

321
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
when someone asks

322
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
a question like this as a cyber security

323
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
person my gears start turning and so

324
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
in our paper we delve really into this

325
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
question and think about

326
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
what you could do as an attacker with

327
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,640
the constrained capabilities

328
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,320
of compromised cubesat hardware

329
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
so the way we go about this is we first

330
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
try to figure out what it takes to build

331
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
a cubesat safely and

332
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
there are a lot of safety standards that

333
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
have been developed for cubesats

334
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
this makes sense because the people who

335
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
are building cubesats aren't

336
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
generally terribly experienced with

337
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
space stuff they'll be like universities

338
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
or kind of smaller businesses and the

339
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
people who launch rockets

340
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
really don't want these cubesats to

341
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
break in a way that could harm the

342
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
overall mission

343
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
and so there are reams and reams of

344
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
safety standards and requirements

345
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
that cubesats are supposed to be built

346
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
to in order to protect the overall

347
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,720
mission

348
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
from the malfunctions that will

349
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
inevitably happen in some people's

350
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
cubesats

351
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
however from our perspective in the

352
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
paper if we invert these standards

353
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
they're basically a guideline on all of

354
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
the things that an attacker

355
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,279
might want to try to get a cubesat to do

356
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
and then conceal that capability

357
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
um so in the paper we actually break

358
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
down these standards and go into depth

359
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
into a handful of them that are directly

360
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
susceptible to kind of

361
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
cyber exploitation a little bit more

362
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
easily modified in software and we focus

363
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,000
in particular

364
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
on radio communications because that's

365
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
where a lot of our research happens in

366
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,240
other topics

367
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
so somewhere we're comfortable on and

368
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,160
the radio safety standards are

369
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
really intuitive here so for example

370
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
cubesats are not allowed to transmit

371
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,959
radio signals for like 45 minutes after

372
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,000
they separate from

373
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
a launch vehicle to reduce the risk of

374
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
radio interference while the cubesat is

375
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,320
close

376
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
to the rocket however as we delved into

377
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,720
these standards we found that

378
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
the actual process for verifying that

379
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
these have been met often just boils

380
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
down to

381
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,279
paperwork the person who builds the

382
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
keepsake has to do a lot of paperwork

383
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
about how it works and how it's designed

384
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
they provide that paperwork to a launch

385
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,079
integrator

386
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,680
who then decides whether or not they

387
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
approve the device based off the

388
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
paperwork

389
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
and this works really well if everyone

390
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
has the same goal of reducing their

391
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,279
liability

392
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
and ensuring that the launch mission is

393
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
safe but if

394
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,800
the operator has been either deceived

395
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,399
into believing their cubesat works in a

396
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
way different than it actually will

397
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,880
in orbit or is deliberately malicious

398
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
and trying to deceive the launch

399
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
integrator

400
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
this system is not quite as robust and

401
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
in our paper we delve into a lot of

402
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,399
different attack scenarios that i'm not

403
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,680
going to get into here

404
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
talking about how those deceptions might

405
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,959
happen

406
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,680
but the main takeaway i think from this

407
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,320
process

408
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
is this idea that when the

409
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
responsibility for truth

410
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
is so hard to independently verify right

411
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
you can't tear apart every single

412
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
cubesat

413
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,519
before you put it onto a rocket or

414
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
you'll never launch your rocket you end

415
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
up having these opportunities for trust

416
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
exploitation

417
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
and the next thing we do in our paper is

418
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
we try to see what would happen

419
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
if you got away with breaking a handful

420
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
of these rules

421
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
in particular a rule about when you're

422
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
allowed to transmit and a rule

423
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
about what frequencies you're allowed to

424
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
transmit on what could you do with

425
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
cubesat hardware

426
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
so we walk through a simulated attack

427
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
scenario and

428
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
the first thing we do is we posit there

429
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,079
is a cubesat that has

430
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
basically two hardware requirements it

431
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,279
needs to have what we call a

432
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
software-defined radio

433
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,040
which are becoming relatively common in

434
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,959
space because they allow you to adapt

435
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
your frequencies programmatically

436
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
and also have an antenna with operating

437
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
capabilities inside a certain frequency

438
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,079
range

439
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
it's very likely you could find someone

440
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
else's cubesat that has both of these

441
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,000
properties

442
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
and it would be fairly trivial to build

443
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
your own cubesat

444
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
with these properties if you invested

445
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,480
the money into it

446
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
during the first stage of launch our

447
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
attacker's malicious cubesat

448
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
will behave like every other satellite

449
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
it won't do anything wrong

450
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
until the moment it separates from the

451
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
rocket in orbit

452
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
at this moment it's going to start

453
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
transmitting radio signals 45 minutes

454
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
sooner than it's supposed to according

455
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
to keepsake design standard

456
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
and those radio signals will be selected

457
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,839
to cause interference with the l1 band

458
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
of the gps or global positioning system

459
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
with the goal of degrading

460
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,720
the reception of gps signals on the

461
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
launch vehicle that just

462
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,040
push that cubesat into orbit the

463
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
ultimate objective for the attacker here

464
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,079
is to try to trigger

465
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,880
an anomaly in the ability of the rocket

466
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,079
to tell where it is

467
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
and this is really scary because rockets

468
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,000
are really scary

469
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,199
when you think about a rocket that's

470
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,040
launching a satellite it's not all that

471
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
different from an icbm

472
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
other than the direction it's pointed in

473
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,160
and so if you

474
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,600
don't want to accidentally start world

475
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
war three and your rocket looks like

476
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
it's straying off of its intended path

477
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
you will normally terminate

478
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,959
your launch mission through a flight

479
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
termination system so that means you'll

480
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
literally trigger

481
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
a self-destruct sequence that can bust

482
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
the rocket before it can hit the ground

483
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
and sometimes this is some guy on the

484
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,279
ground with a big red button

485
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,199
but increasingly we're seeing something

486
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
called an autonomous flight termination

487
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,839
system and

488
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
these are devices that remove the humans

489
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
from the loop here and basically if they

490
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,880
detect

491
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
a positioning or movement anomaly on the

492
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,000
launch vehicle

493
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
they can just trigger that self-destruct

494
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
sequence automatically

495
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,120
now the details on these autonomous

496
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
flight termination systems are very much

497
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,279
not public information so it's hard to

498
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
know exactly how much of an anomaly or

499
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,120
what sort of anomaly would be used

500
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
but we think that at least an attacker

501
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
could degrade the reliability of these

502
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,760
systems which definitely rely on gps

503
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,199
as one key telemetry feed so to model

504
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,399
this we need to understand whether or

505
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
not a cubesat could actually mess with

506
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,279
gps

507
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,079
reception well enough to trigger such an

508
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:12,800
incident

509
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
and what we ended up doing is we built

510
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,040
some astrodynamic simulations the first

511
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
thing we had to simulate

512
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
was that process of the cubesat

513
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
separating from the rocket turns out

514
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
this is surprisingly low-tech

515
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
um cubesats are basically put in these

516
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
little tubes with a spring on one end

517
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,160
and a door on the other

518
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
the door pops open and the spring just

519
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,759
kind of gently shoves that cubesat out

520
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,040
into space

521
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,399
and our attacker is going to be

522
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,079
targeting this early window when the

523
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
cubesat is just starting to drift away

524
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,959
from the rocket

525
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,480
before they're supposed to be able to

526
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
transmit radio signals

527
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
the next question is how much power the

528
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
attacker needs to be able to get that

529
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
radio transmitter on the cubesat

530
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
to deliver to an antenna on the launch

531
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
vehicle

532
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
and there's not a lot of great evidence

533
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
as to like how much reception

534
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
you would or how much power you need to

535
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
transmit to interfere with gps reception

536
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,839
in low earth orbit but there was one

537
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,360
study done by the us department of

538
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,240
transportation

539
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
on a nearby frequency band related to

540
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,399
lte cell towers

541
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
which estimated that kind of that dotted

542
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
line you see on the graph there

543
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,959
as where you'd start to see problems in

544
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
gps reception

545
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
which means that our attacker who's

546
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
targeting the exact same frequency bands

547
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
this is an accidental mirror band

548
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,199
interference this is intentional in-band

549
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,240
interference

550
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
will probably be able to at least cause

551
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,399
trouble during that 20 to 40 minute

552
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,120
period

553
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
depending on what transmitter they have

554
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
another way we look at this in the paper

555
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,279
is to look more on the reception side of

556
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,120
things and to calculate the signal to

557
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
interference plus noise ratio at the

558
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
receiver

559
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
so the dotted line on the top there is

560
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
how the gps receiver would be

561
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
getting information if there was no

562
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
attacker in the scenario

563
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
and then the bars below are different

564
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
power levels and if we compare this to

565
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,399
the kind of parameters

566
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
of a standard or high-end commercial gps

567
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
receiver

568
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
we can see kind of that the attacker is

569
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
able to at least degrade the signal into

570
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,519
that kind of yellow zone on the graph

571
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,240
here where

572
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
it's not great but it's not perfect with

573
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
a low power transmitter

574
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
and with a higher power transmitter

575
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,959
might be able to cause sustained

576
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,559
disruption or complete

577
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,039
elimination of gps precision and the

578
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
amount of time there can be

579
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,199
anywhere from 40 minutes to hours

580
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,559
depending on how close

581
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
they're able to maintain positioning to

582
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
the vehicle and how strong their

583
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,160
transmitter

584
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
is so there's a lot more work

585
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
to be done here um one thing that we

586
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,199
could think about is how we might

587
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
prevent this attack via technical means

588
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
looking at anti-jamming techniques in

589
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
those flight termination systems

590
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,280
and gps receivers on rockets another

591
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
thing we could think about is how we

592
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,559
might prevent cubesats from behaving in

593
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,600
this malicious way

594
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
perhaps with a bill of materials that's

595
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
pre-approved with antennas that like

596
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
can't communicate in the gps spectrum so

597
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,039
you don't have to worry about

598
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,320
unintentional or intentional

599
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,600
interference

600
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,280
we might think about ways that we can

601
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
improve our attribution of this kind of

602
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
attack scenario to increase the risk of

603
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,440
deterrence

604
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
from a nation-state actor or someone

605
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
getting caught doing this so the

606
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
forensic evidence isn't completely out

607
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
there in space there might be something

608
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
on the ground we could use to attribute

609
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,280
it

610
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
and then we might also think about how

611
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,559
we could revise the way we certify and

612
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,840
approve cubesats

613
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
to account for this kind of risk and i

614
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,440
think

615
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
a lot of the panel discussion will be

616
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
about kind of figuring out what sort of

617
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
things we can do against these

618
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
types of threat models without breaking

619
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
the ecosystem that has made small

620
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
satellite launches possible

621
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,720
so to sum things up i think there are

622
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
three general takeaways

623
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
from this research the first is that

624
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,679
safety and

625
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,400
security are not always the same thing

626
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
cubesats are designed to be really

627
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
really safe but the way that safety is

628
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
verified

629
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
is not necessarily robust against an

630
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
adversarial attacker who's trying to lie

631
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,640
or deceive

632
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
their way through a safety verification

633
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
process additionally

634
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
we see changes in technologies like the

635
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
emergence of software-defined radios for

636
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,200
cubesats

637
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
that doesn't necessarily change the

638
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,880
safety standards but it changes the

639
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
capabilities and the adversarial

640
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
risk of these devices finally

641
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
it's really important that we try to

642
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
make these trust assumptions explicit

643
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,679
i'm not saying that we shouldn't trust

644
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,520
anyone we need to trust people to get

645
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
anywhere in space or otherwise

646
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
and shared launches have opened up a

647
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,640
completely different type of space

648
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,559
development than we've ever had

649
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,480
but at the same time when we are making

650
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,919
these trust assumptions we need to

651
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,720
understand what

652
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
risk we're bringing into our missions

653
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
and then account for that whether it's

654
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
through policy

655
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
or through technical mitigations thank

656
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,799
you so much for listening to this

657
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,600
presentation

658
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,360
and hopefully uh it was interesting

659
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,520
james thank you um and thanks to you and

660
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
the team at oxford for a great piece of

661
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
research um

662
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
it's amazing how many um fantastic cyber

663
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
security discussions are followed by the

664
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,000
sentence

665
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
what's the worst that could happen um

666
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
especially when that's in some of the

667
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
really innovative and

668
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
cutting-edge areas of technology so

669
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,280
picking up on a great piece of research

670
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
and

671
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
a great presentation we've now got a

672
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,919
panel where we're going to bring in some

673
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,559
great

674
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
thinkers and people around this area i

675
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
was about to say around this space

676
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
where we're going to start exploring

677
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
some of these um

678
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
concepts and um ideas that james and the

679
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,240
team have come up with

680
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
so um who we have in the rest of the

681
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,919
panel this afternoon is we have erin

720
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
of the cyber security subdivision

721
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,480
at the aerospace corporation which is a

722
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,679
federally funded research and

723
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
development center

724
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,679
where we interact and operate in all

725
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,640
aspects of

726
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,720
typically us government space um

727
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
in my organization we're we're typically

728
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
involved in uh the security of uh

729
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,039
spacecraft you know legacy space systems

730
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,440
uh next generation space systems

731
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
uh to include a launch vehicle although

732
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
we've done a lot more research and

733
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
development in the uh

734
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
in the space segment spacecraft security

735
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,240
and you know things like that but

736
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,679
again i'm looking forward to the panel

737
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
and appreciate being here

738
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
thanks and thanks for being here as well

739
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,880
so andrew finally over to you

740
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
yes yeah good afternoon everyone and

741
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,880
again thank you for inviting me

742
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
to speak at this afternoon's workshop or

743
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
conference in session

744
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
uh i'm uh chief technology officer of

745
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,799
scizo

746
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,600
and also i'm the founding chairman of

747
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
the american

748
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
institute of aeronautics and

749
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
astronautics small satellite

750
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,799
uh technical committee and so i've

751
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,280
worked

752
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,360
right from the very early days uh with

753
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
cubesats and small satellites

754
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
especially cubesats as they've gone from

755
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,000
more

756
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
low in numbers to suddenly blossoming to

757
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,200
universities and

758
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,360
hobbyists and businesses and and of

759
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
course the government level

760
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
uh and more recent work has been of

761
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,960
course i've had a few cubesats go up

762
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
into space

763
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
and now working on the cyber security

764
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
front uh creating a sandbox actually

765
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,120
that creates that simulates the actual

766
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
different segments the ground segment

767
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
link segment and space segment for

768
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,000
cubesats and small

769
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
satellites again thank you for inviting

770
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
me today's

771
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,559
conference in session

772
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
brilliant um yeah and thanks to all the

773
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,120
panels so you can see that

774
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,520
across everybody from the academic

775
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
industry to the community we've got a

776
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,120
great representation

777
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,200
um and actually the way that we're going

778
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
to structure the panel is that first

779
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,919
we'll develop the idea

780
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
and then we'll start talking about how

781
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
do we make this this risk and much more

782
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
risk and also continue to grow the

783
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,960
sector and then really

784
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
um and really trying to set the scene

785
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
for everyone listening about

786
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
how we how we tackle some of these

787
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,799
challenges at scale and collaboratively

788
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,080
but first of all i'm going to be coming

789
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,480
to andrew where having been involved in

790
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,720
the small site community for a long time

791
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
um can you really sort of set the scene

792
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
about what what the growth is like

793
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,880
in this small satellite big satellite

794
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
world and

795
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
and what a difference that the ride

796
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
sharing has made in

797
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,520
in this area and how people are

798
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
approaching it

799
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
yeah starting off remember we have to

800
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
look at the situational landscape that

801
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,159
uh cubesats and i'm going to take more

802
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
on cubesats but does cover small

803
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,880
satellites too

804
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
up to 500 kilograms yes that's a small

805
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,080
satellite

806
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
still uh where we cover scientific

807
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
missions military operators

808
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
education missions uh loads of

809
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,120
commercial

810
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
enterprises civic operations and of

811
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
course even hobbyists so

812
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
when this all and when we think of

813
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
cubesats and small satellites we have

814
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
down to a picosatellite

815
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
which is under one kilogram to

816
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
nanosatellites from one to ten kilograms

817
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
microsatellites to 100 kilograms and of

818
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
course a mini or

819
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,200
small satellite up to 500 kilograms and

820
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,960
originally we were looking at

821
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
oh uh you know onesie twosies

822
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
maybe 10 or 20 back in the mid 90s but

823
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,480
if we think of

824
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,320
cubesats and small satellites where the

825
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
pc industry was

826
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,880
in the 70s where against more of a

827
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
hobbyist and kind of getting off the

828
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
ground and then it exploded into the 80s

829
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
and of course 90s

830
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
where that same thing is happening with

831
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,919
cubesats where now we're looking at

832
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,600
cubesat growth up to

833
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,480
over 1400 units a year by 2022

834
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
and mini satellite growth up to 250

835
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
units of course this is all being helped

836
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,320
with spacex starlink and oneweb and

837
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
others but there are certainly

838
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,080
a lot of small satellites going into

839
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
orbit even the pico satellites

840
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,919
where there be launch of even a hundred

841
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,080
at one time all distributed at once to

842
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
return to earth within a day or two

843
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
and this is all being uh facilitated by

844
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,400
these ride shares

845
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,960
uh both here in the u.s and

846
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,039
internationally so there is a

847
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,080
broad broad sprectum and of course

848
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559
with that large number uh great

849
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,600
vulnerability

850
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
in the situation in all three segments

851
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
again the ground segment the lynx

852
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,760
segment

853
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,720
and the space segment

854
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,880
um so that's just really showing the

855
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
massive growth that we've got

856
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
um across all of those um stakeholders

857
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,159
in that ride sharing world so i mean

858
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,360
ryan coming to you

859
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,960
from um from your perspective on that

860
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
on that journey across all of the

861
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
stakeholders through

862
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,000
all the payload operators and all of the

863
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
launch vehicle operators

864
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,919
that's quite a complex world when it

865
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
comes to how they're all interrelating

866
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,600
and forming those trust models

867
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
um to actually get the payloads in into

868
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
orbit can you talk sort of more through

869
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,200
through that perspective as well

870
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
yeah of course um so like you said it's

871
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
a complicated um

872
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
set of interactions right you have um

873
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
first just starting at the launch site

874
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
by itself there's a lot of

875
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,440
things going on the launch site a lot of

876
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
support equipment uh there's a launch

877
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
vehicle provider typically

878
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,679
the rocket owner you know rocket launch

879
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
is gonna have a primary mission

880
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
which which may include one or could be

881
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
more spacecraft on a primary mission

882
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,640
and even though spacecraft could have

883
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
multiple vendors uh them themselves

884
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,919
could have multiple payloads and i'll

885
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
explain what i mean by that in a second

886
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,480
and and and they primary mission

887
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
typically uh certainly has multiple uh

888
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
stakeholders as well

889
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
um and that's not even getting into the

890
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
ride shares and the in the cubesats yet

891
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
so that's just kind of a default launch

892
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,399
uh uh configuration

893
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,880
uh so these spacecraft are are built by

894
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
a vendor or a set of vendors uh they're

895
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
delivered to a launch site

896
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
um and they may sit there for a while

897
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
before they're before they're actually

898
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,720
flown

899
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,039
uh there may be a chain of custody issue

900
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,399
where um

901
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,080
uh various people may have access to

902
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,679
them uh potentially

903
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,799
um and so when we talk about

904
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,320
getting into the spacecraft themselves

905
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,600
you know again i'll talk about cubesats

906
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,799
in a second but

907
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,840
uh the spacecraft themselves um you know

908
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
they may have a single payload and by

909
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
payload i don't mean that thing that

910
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
you deliver in a cyber security attack i

911
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
mean the thing that's actually supposed

912
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,679
to do the mission

913
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,880
uh they certainly have what's called a

914
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,399
spacecraft bus and these are the things

915
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,840
doing the attitude control

916
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,760
the positioning the command and data

917
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,039
handling

918
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,640
all the primary things you need to do to

919
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,200
have a to have a spacecraft fly

920
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
um they certainly have their primary

921
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,840
payload they could have multiple

922
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
payloads

923
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
uh then on top of all that you you get

924
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
into this cubesat world of

925
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
okay like like james said we want to

926
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
share some launch vehicle capacity

927
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,559
and split the cost um and there could be

928
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,159
a few there could be tens of

929
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,880
small sets and cubesats um you know

930
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
riding with them

931
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
um the the other thing to keep in mind

932
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
that you know james hit this in his

933
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,799
original um uh presentation was uh the

934
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,000
spacecraft themselves the primary

935
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,279
missions are typically close to

936
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
one-of-a-kind systems right they're uh

937
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,159
they're built by some vendor they're um

938
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
they're there for a particular mission

939
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
uh they have a huge dependency on fault

940
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,080
management uh and in this case fault

941
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,120
management uh

942
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
may or may not you know really do the

943
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
the right thing when a security event

944
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
right they're built for

945
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,320
a random failure and a radiation event

946
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,279
something like that and the fault

947
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,720
management systems

948
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
aren't specifically built for for cyber

949
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,000
intrusions

950
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,039
um and then you have the issue of

951
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,960
of integrating these these cubesats that

952
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,039
the um

953
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
james was talking about if one of them

954
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
is malicious um

955
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
you know what effects could they could

956
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,600
they have on your primary mission and

957
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
the primary mission isn't necessarily

958
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,760
built for

959
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
uh for depending but against that so uh

960
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,120
there's

961
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,559
a lot of things a lot of different

962
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,960
stakeholders uh and each mission is each

963
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
launch is gonna be different it's gonna

964
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
have different stakeholders and uh

965
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,840
just it's important to kind of keep in

966
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,880
mind all the different uh players in the

967
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,760
in that area

968
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
thanks for that and actually that's a

969
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
really nice time to segue across

970
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
to erin and the work that you're doing

971
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
with the space isaac

972
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,880
because you do have multiple sets of

973
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,399
stakeholders in there

974
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,600
um and looking to both share information

975
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
gain context and and try and build trust

976
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,120
really across a lot of them

977
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
as well but do you want to talk about

978
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,159
that from your perspective as well and

979
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,200
actually

980
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
how are you seeing people starting to

981
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
talk about risk and balancing that

982
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,760
across

983
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,279
all of those different stakeholders be

984
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,360
that of different scales and size and

985
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
across that supply chain as well

986
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
yeah well let me set the stage a little

987
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
bit for you of what the space isaac

988
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,679
looks like

989
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,520
when we launched the space isac it was

990
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,880
launched by the s t

991
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,799
partnership forum which is chaired by

992
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,000
nasa

993
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,360
so we had an initiative from

994
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
the u.s government calling the

995
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
commercial and international and

996
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,640
uh government contractors together to

997
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,399
collaborate to share information with

998
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,760
one another

999
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
and so part of the reason why they did

1000
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
that is they saw the lower barriers to

1001
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
entry to enter the commercial space

1002
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,799
economy

1003
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,919
uh the proliferation of leo and the need

1004
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,799
for us to share

1005
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,960
information about cyber security risks

1006
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
and vulnerabilities

1007
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
in a trusted community what we've done

1008
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
in the space isaac is we've created an

1009
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,640
environment where

1010
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
you have government and commercial and

1011
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,399
international coming together in

1012
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,440
different forums

1013
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,159
where they're able to uh share

1014
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,519
information with each other

1015
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,919
about what they're seeing on the horizon

1016
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,640
the problems that already exist today

1017
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,000
and at it uh provide them an opportunity

1018
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
where they get to know each other and

1019
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
we're increasing trust on a regular

1020
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,159
basis by these regular forums

1021
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
we also have um a standing information

1022
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
sharing working group that

1023
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,919
has created rules of engagement so we

1024
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
have what's called our operations and

1025
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,559
analysis

1026
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,880
homework and we also have priority

1027
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,559
intelligence requirements

1028
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
so we're scoping what's important to the

1029
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,559
community to share and we're also giving

1030
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,159
them some rules to follow when they

1031
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:38,480
share

1032
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
information so we can send alerts and

1033
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,679
notices

1034
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
to the global space community on the

1035
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
regular so that they

1036
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
have access to this type of information

1037
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
allows them to respond to you

1038
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,240
accidents so that's some of the work

1039
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
that's great and actually across such a

1040
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
diverse community i've got to say that

1041
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,960
isn't a small piece of work so

1042
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
so hats off to you and the team for for

1043
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,039
really sort of

1044
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,720
getting that conversation going and

1045
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
starting to build that trust across

1046
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,200
that community but what we've done

1047
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
really now i think

1048
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,279
is is set out from both the research

1049
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,080
um and the growth of the sector and some

1050
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,440
of that challenge out there

1051
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,679
is that actually when we're looking at

1052
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,200
risk across the sector

1053
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,760
we've got to try and balance growing the

1054
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,279
sector and growing that innovation and

1055
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,320
allowing that

1056
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,640
that diversity to keep increasing

1057
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,440
but also making risk manageable as well

1058
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,240
and and when

1059
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,159
james is is talking about his research

1060
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,000
about the potential threat but then

1061
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
at the same time we've got andrew

1062
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,679
talking about the

1063
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,440
the the different numbers of

1064
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
stakeholders out there and in even the

1065
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,640
small groups that are trying to do this

1066
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
in a safe and secure manner

1067
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,840
how do we how do we find the middle

1068
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,760
ground across all of those so um

1069
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,559
it's it's i'm going to come to you james

1070
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,200
first

1071
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,919
so if we're looking at the security of

1072
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,519
this sort of challenge

1073
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,880
and you've been looking through this in

1074
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,120
your research so

1075
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
can we make this a practical and viable

1076
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,240
um

1077
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
approach to actually increase this

1078
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,760
increase the security around these

1079
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,240
platforms

1080
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
yeah it's a very hard question um i

1081
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,320
think that

1082
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
we can definitely improve things and

1083
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
it's very easy at a conference like

1084
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,120
cycon to think that

1085
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,279
cyber security is hopeless but we've

1086
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,159
actually gotten

1087
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,559
quite good at doing cyber security on

1088
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,360
the ground

1089
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,519
and it takes a lot of effort for

1090
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,640
attackers to

1091
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,919
especially when they're targeting one

1092
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,840
specific system and they absolutely need

1093
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,200
to get that system

1094
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,679
to be successful and i think that we can

1095
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
learn a lot of lessons from terrestrial

1096
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,039
cyber security

1097
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,279
in space and we can make progress right

1098
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,120
like very basic things

1099
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,399
encryption logging forensics having

1100
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,399
those capabilities on our space assets

1101
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,159
can go a really long way

1102
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,480
towards making it much harder for

1103
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,200
attackers

1104
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,679
and more difficult i think it can be

1105
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,440
very tempting to try to go with a

1106
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
complete security approach and want to

1107
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,719
lock down a systems that is completely

1108
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,000
unbreakable

1109
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,839
and we need to find a middle ground

1110
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,040
between the two

1111
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
to be able to have these very low cost

1112
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,119
innovative systems in orbit

1113
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,879
which is also a goal that we should have

1114
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,319
when we're thinking about security

1115
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
but to follow up on on that question i

1116
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,079
mean you you picked up right in the

1117
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,440
presentation right at the very start

1118
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
it's it's that trust model so from the

1119
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,520
research that you did it's uh

1120
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
at the moment it's very much a almost

1121
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,280
like a self-assessed questionnaire of

1122
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
have you done the right things

1123
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
um i mean from what you've seen in the

1124
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,800
research you've been doing with the team

1125
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,359
is do you think that is still viable

1126
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
yeah so i think that that trust model

1127
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
needs some sort of pushback i think

1128
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,399
maybe one way to do it is that you earn

1129
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,480
trust over time right so

1130
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,639
if it's your first cubesat maybe you do

1131
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,800
have to have someone else do what we

1132
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,280
call

1133
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,640
a day in the life test where you

1134
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,400
essentially simulate the first day of

1135
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,359
your cubesat's

1136
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,680
existence and then see that it doesn't

1137
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,800
break

1138
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
and later on you might gain trust over

1139
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,560
many missions that you can do that

1140
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
within your own laboratory

1141
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,839
alternatively you might have like a

1142
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,839
trusted hardware or a trusted software

1143
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,400
model

1144
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,880
where in order to get rid of some of

1145
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,960
that just you can tick the box saying my

1146
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
cubesat doesn't operate during this time

1147
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
window and will spot you

1148
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
have software that cannot operate during

1149
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,839
that time window

1150
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,200
and then check that the cubesat is

1151
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
running that software as it

1152
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,599
as a additional threshold um and all of

1153
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,599
those can be circumvented it's a game of

1154
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
cat and mouse

1155
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,720
but it's nice to at least move the bar a

1156
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,359
little bit higher

1157
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,560
and i'm also going to pick up on

1158
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
something that that you spoke to

1159
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
us about before the panel which is when

1160
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
we're looking at actually getting the

1161
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,280
getting the cubesats out of the launch

1162
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,560
vehicle

1163
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,640
actually it's the physical protections

1164
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
around those cubesats

1165
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,800
as well which as as the drive for

1166
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
reducing weight has increased then that

1167
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
has potentially increased

1168
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
the risk of rf interference you'll just

1169
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,760
quickly touch on that as well

1170
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
yeah it's a really cool topic um and i

1171
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
think it speaks to this idea that you

1172
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,599
might change the technology

1173
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,359
with an effect that's basically the same

1174
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,800
for safety but very different for

1175
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,079
security so

1176
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
we're seeing those tubes i talked about

1177
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
in my presentation the pea pods

1178
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
they're made out of i think aluminum and

1179
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,599
they're essentially faraday cages so

1180
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,280
radio signals can't get out of those

1181
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
tubes while the door is closed and the

1182
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,320
cubesats inside

1183
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,400
um but there's been some push towards

1184
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,000
changing the deployers that they're made

1185
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,480
out of

1186
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,240
lighter weight materials like carbon

1187
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,720
fiber or even they're open on the sides

1188
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
to reduce the weight because you don't

1189
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
actually need the side bits there

1190
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
and those changes don't do anything for

1191
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
the safety of the cubesat it's still

1192
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
locked into that tube until the door

1193
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,040
opens

1194
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
but now a radio signal can get out of

1195
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
the tube because maybe the material

1196
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
doesn't create a proper ferry cage or

1197
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,680
it's open

1198
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,359
on one side so the radio emissions can

1199
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,119
get out and then you can start jamming

1200
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,320
while you're on the launch pad or

1201
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,119
something which

1202
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,599
is much much more dangerous because the

1203
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
range safety tolerances that close to

1204
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,839
populated areas are going to be much

1205
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,640
tighter

1206
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,280
so again it's one of those uh areas

1207
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,560
where physical changes

1208
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
and then the potential onward changes

1209
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
from from the adversarial point

1210
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
is making the mission quite complicated

1211
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,880
when it comes to

1212
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,920
the the risk and trust models so andrew

1213
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
coming to you from that community

1214
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,800
perspective

1215
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,240
and actually building creating launching

1216
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
um all of these different payloads

1217
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,440
what sort of impact is this sort of

1218
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
thinking potentially going to have on

1219
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,520
the community

1220
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,280
yeah um i don't sound like a

1221
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,200
debbie downer or anything like that but

1222
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
i do see

1223
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,839
uh more and more with both let's say

1224
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,200
players like nanoracks

1225
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
in the united states and also nasa and

1226
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,720
their independent verification

1227
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,320
validation facility and the launch

1228
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,839
providers doing

1229
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,040
more independent verification of the

1230
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,280
cubesat and small satellite uh being

1231
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
compliant not only the safety side

1232
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,760
but a cyber security side that might

1233
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
overwhelm

1234
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,160
a lot of lower cost of players uh

1235
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,560
lower revenue players so that hobbyist

1236
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
that did a fundraiser for

1237
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,440
their cubesat may not even make that

1238
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,320
threshold

1239
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
and even tougher for a lot of

1240
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,079
universities as they go through this

1241
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,200
process and

1242
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
certainly be a great learning experience

1243
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,240
for all players to learn what's involved

1244
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,640
in a

1245
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
verification validation process but i

1246
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
see that becoming uh

1247
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,359
more into play um and i

1248
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,760
even uh feel even with the they're

1249
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
talking about you talking about changes

1250
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,359
in the

1251
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,599
the p-pods for rejecting the cubesats

1252
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,040
and small satellites

1253
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,880
in a sense i go back to in the shuttle

1254
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
days when launching a small satellites

1255
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,839
that in the end it may

1256
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,200
end up being a very tight container

1257
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,599
uh even though it's heavier it still is

1258
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,800
a protective carrier

1259
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
uh container uh from the launch vehicle

1260
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,240
and the larger payload

1261
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,280
by keeping that small satellite shelled

1262
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,119
in because it can be a very capable

1263
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
system to bring down a launch vehicle a

1264
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,359
large satellite or really anything

1265
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,599
so i see more effort on

1266
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
more restrictions in that process but

1267
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,640
also as a community

1268
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
for example i'm working on an effort to

1269
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,880
create the san cyber security sandbox

1270
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,960
using our links to our system where we

1271
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,320
actually have a real

1272
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,640
cubesat though it's on the ground that

1273
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
simulates the space segment we have a

1274
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
element that

1275
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
simulates the link segment in

1276
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
partnership with global star

1277
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
and then the ground segment uh setting

1278
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
up secure ground servers

1279
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
ground servers for the mission side

1280
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,520
where we can

1281
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,079
or people selected groups in the smart

1282
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
larger small satellite cubesat community

1283
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
where we probe those constant constantly

1284
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,240
probe those vulnerabilities

1285
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,000
and try and address those back to the

1286
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,079
community to make it easier at least for

1287
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,359
a smaller player

1288
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,560
uh like universities and hobbyists when

1289
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,000
i say smaller players so could be a

1290
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,079
large university but still compared to

1291
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,880
like your

1292
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,760
your nasa department of defense boeing

1293
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,119
and lockheed martin

1294
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,040
uh where they have a much larger budget

1295
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,359
to work with than these organizations

1296
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,119
uh at least have this sandbox

1297
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,560
environment and we're going to be

1298
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
talking about this

1299
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,280
and sharing this several times

1300
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,520
throughout different conferences

1301
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,599
throughout this year actually where

1302
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,520
people can get involved and then share

1303
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
that with the community

1304
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,839
the small satellite cubesat community so

1305
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,319
can we

1306
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,079
just um i mean one again one of the

1307
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,280
things that we've we've picked up in

1308
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,640
previous conversations is

1309
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,599
we just touch base on the cost of of a

1310
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,520
of a typical cubesat mission because

1311
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
again it's one of those things that

1312
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,640
we keep talking about democratization of

1313
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,000
it and actually but just

1314
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
just can you just throw out a couple of

1315
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,280
numbers of right let's get a cubesat

1316
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,800
airborne um how much is that going to

1317
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,520
cost

1318
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,720
because people think i think it's

1319
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,680
yeah originally when i worked with this

1320
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,040
whole idea has raised

1321
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,680
you know 50 000 get launched get a free

1322
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,200
ride you're good

1323
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,280
on the cubesats but what i found in

1324
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,800
several missions

1325
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,240
is the real cost just gone to

1326
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,640
uh to university anywhere from a quarter

1327
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,560
of a million to a million dollars

1328
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,440
and that's just uh partly due to the

1329
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,480
expense

1330
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,240
in the process not the launch cost but

1331
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
more just in getting the resources lined

1332
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,599
up and managing it

1333
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,240
even when you even flight qualified

1334
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,119
hardware

1335
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,079
and then issues related to that

1336
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,920
aggravate and stretch that time to

1337
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,280
develop including well

1338
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,839
for university teams they're still going

1339
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,480
to school

1340
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,880
they still have classes they still take

1341
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
holiday

1342
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
they have you know their final exams and

1343
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,000
then some of them even

1344
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
graduate and then they get so those

1345
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,480
cause all these added delays

1346
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
which drives up the cost for emissions

1347
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,319
so what i'm telling a lot of

1348
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,079
universities if they can get

1349
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,800
into space that is a major milestone

1350
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,520
just to get

1351
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
into space if they can get their small

1352
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,200
satellite cube satellite

1353
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,480
to say hello world that's fantastic

1354
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,079
um unfortunately there's a high failure

1355
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,079
rate with cubesats and small satellites

1356
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,640
which

1357
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
aggravates this whole situation and so

1358
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,319
we're trying to address this as a

1359
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,440
community

1360
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
to uh to better identify the problem and

1361
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,040
then

1362
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,880
now you throw into all the cyber

1363
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,960
security that has to be concerned

1364
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,640
uh with this process again with the

1365
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
ground segment the link segment in the

1366
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,440
space segment

1367
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,160
uh the goal is as can we how do we

1368
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
manage that

1369
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,760
and share that to help take the load off

1370
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,240
of

1371
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,599
all the various players including those

1372
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
who want to get started in this cubesat

1373
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,480
world so

1374
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,839
it's kind of like where the i said the

1375
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,079
pc world was in the 70s where you had

1376
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,359
all these hobbyists and

1377
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,800
building boards and everything and then

1378
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
how it streamlined out i think we're

1379
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,920
seeing that same

1380
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
thing sort of situation take shape uh in

1381
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,960
the cubesat and small satellite world

1382
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
how that dresses you brilliant no that's

1383
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,079
that's

1384
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,400
that's a great answer and actually it

1385
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
goes to show that actually we've

1386
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
there's lots to discuss when it comes to

1387
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
uh risk and managing risk across all

1388
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,640
those

1389
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,440
stakeholders and and ryan can i come to

1390
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,720
you on that from

1391
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,160
from your background and your

1392
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,240
perspectives because

1393
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,920
that there's there's a huge amount of um

1394
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,520
risk management across all of those

1395
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
different stakeholders but

1396
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,160
they're all looking at it through their

1397
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,200
different perspectives um

1398
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
how do you sort of like see that across

1399
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,640
all of those different stakeholders

1400
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
considering that the criticality of a

1401
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,920
lot of those missions and the high cost

1402
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,319
involved is this something that is there

1403
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,240
a common view or is there lots of

1404
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,839
different views at the moment

1405
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,440
yeah yeah for sure and risk management

1406
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,000
is all about

1407
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
intelligent risk management right i've

1408
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,280
seen risk management done

1409
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
intelligently and i've seen it done

1410
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
where it's just kind of a

1411
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
it ultimately creates a paperwork drill

1412
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,200
and it just drives up your cost right so

1413
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,839
um you know starting with even the

1414
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,720
economics

1415
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,440
um you can't play a million dollars for

1416
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,920
independent verification on a 250 000

1417
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,480
cubesat the economics just doesn't uh

1418
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
make sense

1419
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,960
um and certainly if if that's what i

1420
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,079
that's what it would take in order to

1421
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,240
get a ride share to work um

1422
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,640
then i'm never going to pair a 250 000

1423
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
cubesat with a with 100 million dollar

1424
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,319
uh spacecraft right that just wouldn't

1425
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
make sense because the the cost that

1426
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,319
they're gonna absorb in the ride share

1427
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,119
um isn't gonna isn't gonna pay for the

1428
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,200
uh for the independent verification so

1429
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
i think we need to get back into

1430
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
intelligent risk management uh we need

1431
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,760
to think about what threats are

1432
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,640
realistic

1433
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,079
and which ones you should pay to

1434
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,760
mitigate uh and there are ways to

1435
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,280
mitigate all these threats and

1436
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
and there's a cost associated with them

1437
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,960
um standards are part of it and they're

1438
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,599
great

1439
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,640
um you know and we should probably have

1440
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,880
uh more you know launched specific

1441
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
standards in terms of security

1442
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
um but but again that gets an

1443
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,480
intelligent risk management you can pay

1444
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
for the wrong things you can make a 250

1445
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
000 cubesat into a million dollar

1446
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,960
cubesat and still not actually mitigate

1447
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,920
any important

1448
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,119
um threats so as as an example

1449
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,720
um you know james laid out a very

1450
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,160
specific scenario where

1451
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,839
um where a cubesat will maliciously

1452
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,880
um broadcast in the gps l1 frequency

1453
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,200
right

1454
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,760
right after separation in order to

1455
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,480
affect the

1456
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,560
launch termination system and that's a

1457
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
very realistic scenario

1458
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,839
uh there are ways to mitigate that

1459
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,560
particular scenario so for example

1460
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,520
um i i could have i could force a

1461
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,560
independent input

1462
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,599
and uh into your rf chain and verify so

1463
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,319
i could ask you

1464
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,520
for example to um to specify what what

1465
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,000
uh

1466
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,599
what filter you're using to specify what

1467
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,359
antenna you're using and to

1468
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,440
and and just at a paperwork level to

1469
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,760
demonstrate okay that there's a

1470
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,560
tens or probably 100 db uh loss at that

1471
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,760
frequency

1472
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,520
um and of course you as a malicious

1473
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,800
actor could

1474
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,440
um could could put the wrong part in or

1475
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,400
could lie about what the

1476
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,319
what the part was well i could have

1477
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
somebody test that it wouldn't be very

1478
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,720
expensive to have somebody do an

1479
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
independent test on that by by putting

1480
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,000
in their own input

1481
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,599
uh and testing your rf chain and

1482
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,200
demonstrating that goes through your rf

1483
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,920
chain

1484
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,839
and i could do that at the launch site

1485
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,280
and i could i could maintain a chain of

1486
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,119
custody so that you couldn't go back and

1487
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,640
and put new filters and antennas on

1488
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,280
there um that's going to cost some money

1489
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,520
um it's not an exorbitant cost if i go

1490
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,200
off and do that for every threat anybody

1491
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,480
could possibly imagine whether they're

1492
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,920
realistic or not

1493
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,960
then i'm going to end up with a million

1494
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,280
dollars of cost but if i just go through

1495
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,839
um you know four five six things that i

1496
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,599
think are realistic

1497
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,960
then you can actually have independent

1498
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,520
verification uh for a reasonable cost

1499
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,480
and not

1500
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
completely destroy the economics of your

1501
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,480
of your rideshare um

1502
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,000
there's so many good points that we've

1503
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
come out with all of that and and i

1504
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
want to like pick up on those in in in

1505
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,079
probably the next set of questions as

1506
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,040
well but

1507
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,680
um i mean erin coming to you you've got

1508
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,480
um

1509
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,280
a great community building up around the

1510
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,520
you and the work of the space nissac

1511
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,560
across all areas of the of the sector

1512
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,839
and and a lot of that will be talking

1513
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:52,880
about the trust as you've already

1514
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,560
highlighted but also they're all

1515
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,400
managing risk as well

1516
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,040
so so how are you how are you seeing

1517
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,160
that growth of

1518
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,000
of trust and discussion about risk

1519
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,079
management across the sector

1520
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,280
because um i mean certainly looking at

1521
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,920
for example

1522
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,319
the the work that jeff has done with the

1523
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,240
aviation ice ac

1524
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,839
building trust and building those

1525
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,920
communities is a is a huge

1526
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,720
challenge um especially on things that

1527
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,880
are critical involving safety as well so

1528
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,720
how are you seeing the industry and

1529
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
yourselves approaching building out that

1530
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,160
that trust and that really good

1531
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,720
information sharing

1532
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,920
yeah uh so in the global space community

1533
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,160
we know there's a lot of different

1534
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,640
uh subgroups and one of the subgroups

1535
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
you could say would be like uh

1536
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,480
us defense contractors they're quite a

1537
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,599
large group

1538
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,559
and they've been managing risk in their

1539
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,520
own way for

1540
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,280
a long time based on military

1541
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,040
requirements

1542
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,520
but when it comes to the commercial

1543
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,240
sector

1544
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,599
and non-military implications associated

1545
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,319
with

1546
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,400
launching uh vehicles in space and

1547
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,720
putting payloads in space then there's

1548
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,160
a whole different environment as has

1549
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
been addressed on this panel with the

1550
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
smallsat community being primarily

1551
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
composed of small businesses startups

1552
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,359
and spinouts from universities or

1553
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,440
university research settings

1554
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,599
so what we've done in the space isaac is

1555
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,480
we formed

1556
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,880
a small satellite owners and operators

1557
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,040
community of interest

1558
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,160
and non-small stat owners and operators

1559
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,760
are welcome to join this community of

1560
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,480
interest

1561
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,839
so we're looking to bridge a large

1562
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,800
uh group of folks that normally are not

1563
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,400
engaged in small stats with the

1564
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
smallsack community

1565
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,839
and that also includes our public sector

1566
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,000
partners from across the world

1567
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,559
so we when we form this group then from

1568
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,000
the outset it is

1569
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,319
a public-private partnership so

1570
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,960
government and uh

1571
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,520
the uh small sat community coming

1572
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
together to be able to talk about cyber

1573
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,480
security

1574
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,119
and our going in approach for this group

1575
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,359
is not to talk about standards it's talk

1576
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,800
about best practices

1577
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,000
create awareness education and just

1578
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
have a forum where we can talk about

1579
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,079
threats and vulnerabilities because that

1580
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,240
may not be an opportunity for someone

1581
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,839
who's in the small sac community to

1582
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,400
every day

1583
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,480
have a place to go where they can just

1584
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,920
chat you know what is the risk

1585
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,359
associated with

1586
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,400
um a certain uh function of their small

1587
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:20,720
sat

1588
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,760
and what are the threats and

1589
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,440
vulnerabilities that they need to be

1590
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,880
aware of

1591
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,760
when uh designing cyber security in to

1592
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,119
their system

1593
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,319
so this forum that we've created is

1594
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,000
uh intended to not necessarily impose

1595
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,800
standards um in the short term is to

1596
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,079
create awareness

1597
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,480
and over the long term we should start

1598
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,280
considering

1599
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,440
and this group will be encouraged to

1600
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,440
share information between the public and

1601
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,040
private sector so that

1602
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,720
the standards are informed uh because as

1603
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,400
we continue to progress down this path

1604
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,480
where there's more implications on

1605
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,520
civilians for the use of space systems

1606
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,160
then there will be things like space

1607
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,920
systems being designated as critical

1608
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
infrastructure is something that's being

1609
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,720
discussed and so

1610
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,960
we're very well well aware in space

1611
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,119
isaac that there's the potential for

1612
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,000
regulations

1613
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,280
to come from that designation and

1614
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
although it's very important we want the

1615
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,119
public private sector conversation to

1616
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,040
inform the regulations so

1617
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,200
this gives the startups the university

1618
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,880
setting the

1619
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,000
small businesses a a way to inform the

1620
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,119
direction that we're going

1621
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,119
thanks erin and that's actually really

1622
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,119
nice really nice to hear i mean

1623
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,440
um already if we sort of just reflecting

1624
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,040
on the panel we've got

1625
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,960
some great research from james and team

1626
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,640
oxford highlighting some some really

1627
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,920
good challenges

1628
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,119
um and we've got a thriving

1629
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,000
and growing sector and community around

1630
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,240
there and already in the space ice act

1631
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
you're having those discussions and

1632
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
forming those communities so for the

1633
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,200
people who are listening hopefully we're

1634
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,960
showing that there's already

1635
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,640
spaces out there to be able to to

1636
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,079
discuss um

1637
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,359
and move forward and collaborate on

1638
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,440
these areas and it's interesting we've

1639
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,400
had one question

1640
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,640
um come in that talks about how do you

1641
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,079
keep cubesats free from

1642
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,720
compromise and malfunction and ideas and

1643
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
suggestions which

1644
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,280
is great timing because that pretty much

1645
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,040
aligns with the final um

1646
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,319
bit of the panel um and and

1647
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,240
i mean the first thing i'd sort of sort

1648
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,839
of highlight i think that

1649
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,359
across all of this is um

1650
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,839
i tried when i'm when we've done stuff

1651
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,280
like this in the past it's a

1652
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,200
try not to think about your satellite as

1653
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
a satellite think about it as a computer

1654
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,720
that happens to be in space

1655
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,920
um when you're talking about your

1656
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,280
aircraft don't think about it as an

1657
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,640
aircraft it happens to be a computer

1658
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,480
with wings that flies around the world

1659
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,599
and your ships and your boats so it's

1660
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,319
really

1661
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,240
if we treat them like computers that

1662
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,760
we're putting in physical proximity to

1663
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,119
other computers

1664
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,760
actually how do we how do we start

1665
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,880
making this

1666
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,079
um something that is easy for all of the

1667
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,520
different stakeholders

1668
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,319
to to do to secure these and reduce

1669
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,000
almost classes of vulnerability through

1670
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,880
the design or safety considerations so

1671
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,079
it really sort of go through

1672
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,760
go through the panel and so sort of last

1673
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,359
set of questions is

1674
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,400
how do we take this forward um and how

1675
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,079
we do we really start to not just sort

1676
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,280
of manage the risk and prioritize the

1677
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,880
risk right as you were saying but also

1678
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,720
really start reducing the risk so that

1679
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
we we keep the barrier for entry

1680
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,760
low for all of these different

1681
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,720
communities to be involved

1682
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,559
so um i'm i'm probably

1683
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,839
going to come to you james first to

1684
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,599
to see what you think from your

1685
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,839
perspective on this of actually

1686
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,760
what would be some some good things you

1687
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,119
would want the community to do out of

1688
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,280
this

1689
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,480
yeah so i think ryan's point about

1690
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,240
figuring out which threat models are

1691
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,160
credible and then prioritizing them

1692
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,359
effectively

1693
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,119
is really the key here and trying to

1694
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,800
create an ecosystem where that's

1695
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,440
possible

1696
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
so i think that involves people doing

1697
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,440
offensive security research

1698
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,160
making this information available for

1699
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,359
researchers or

1700
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,920
doing it internally even and then

1701
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,079
working on defenses and mitigations as a

1702
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,920
secondary step there

1703
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
and i think the way that we make it

1704
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,280
affordable and accessible is thinking

1705
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,280
about ways that we can standardize not

1706
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,079
just a

1707
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,359
you should do x but you should do x by y

1708
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,000
so come up with very basic rules of the

1709
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,480
road

1710
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
and best practices that people can

1711
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
incorporate into a lot of space missions

1712
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,280
because you're right they're all

1713
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,079
fundamentally

1714
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,480
computers in space that are very similar

1715
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,000
in a lot of ways in very different and

1716
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,280
very small ways

1717
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,040
and if we can make that similar bit

1718
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
secure then we can focus on the

1719
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,160
differences as kind of icing on the cake

1720
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
brilliant and and thank you for that and

1721
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,359
and uh andrew i'm going to come to you

1722
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,480
next from this community perspective

1723
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,880
because as you've already sort of raised

1724
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,079
it say

1725
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,240
it's there's not a lot of margin in

1726
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,280
making these things

1727
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,880
and trying to launch these things and

1728
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,480
actually people are still learning and

1729
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
doing this as a learning project

1730
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,800
um a i'm thinking ahead we can use this

1731
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,240
as a cyber security learning project as

1732
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,280
well which is great for the

1733
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,920
for the sector as a whole but how do we

1734
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,480
how do we

1735
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,119
help ingrain that into the community and

1736
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,800
get people thinking along these lines

1737
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,880
right well one thing that's happening

1738
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,240
like i've explained earlier

1739
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,280
is we've now are opening up a sandbox so

1740
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,599
to speak to cyber security sandbox for

1741
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,599
cubesats and small satellites with an

1742
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,680
actual cubesat small satellite albeit on

1743
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,319
the ground

1744
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,119
not in space uh that covers all those

1745
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,720
segments we just talked about earlier

1746
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,920
the space segment

1747
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,440
where the satellite is or it could be a

1748
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,839
rover or what have you the link segment

1749
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,440
and then the ground segment

1750
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
and instead of sharing that sandbox and

1751
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,200
discussing it

1752
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,280
you know once every conference every few

1753
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,280
months like here at cycon

1754
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,680
our goal is to build that community and

1755
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,079
have it active throughout the year

1756
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,559
and then share those results and best

1757
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,520
practices

1758
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,480
at each conference so for example we

1759
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,359
have an actual

1760
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,240
hackasad event coming up at defcon uh

1761
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,319
this august where we're taking this

1762
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,799
taking all the lessons learned right and

1763
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,920
and how that

1764
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,680
and share that to the community and then

1765
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,520
following that same week

1766
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,119
with the small satellite conference

1767
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,960
again discussing and presenting

1768
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,319
the cyber security sandbox and lessons

1769
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,160
learned during that time

1770
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,599
and then that's following with the

1771
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,359
ascend conference so it's not stopping

1772
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,359
at these conferences and workshops

1773
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,760
but rather keep the sandbox thriving

1774
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
have a discussion within the community

1775
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,359
matter of fact one group of us were

1776
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,280
meeting weekly and updating and all our

1777
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,640
work when i say a group of us this

1778
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,200
includes

1779
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,799
uh nasa jsc is part of this uh mit

1780
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,839
uh um uh i guess now writing embry

1781
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,319
riddle uh name the university they're

1782
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,079
all part of it and certainly everyone

1783
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,000
who's part of the small satellite

1784
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,119
technical committee

1785
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,599
which is a very broad broad audience and

1786
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,880
then that fans out

1787
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,720
to the broader community and again when

1788
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,160
we say small satellite we're talking

1789
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,000
cubesats nanosats and

1790
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,720
picosats so we see this sandbox is a

1791
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,520
great way

1792
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,240
to help set those best practices and

1793
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,480
standards and lessons learned to make it

1794
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,520
easier

1795
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,640
for uh even players like hobbyists in

1796
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,480
universities and small businesses to get

1797
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,520
involved and even

1798
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
large organizations like a lockheed

1799
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,440
martin or nasa or department of defense

1800
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,680
thanks for that um and that shows a lot

1801
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,760
of that good work in the

1802
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,520
community and and ryan coming to you

1803
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
um but one of the things that you've

1804
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,920
touched upon is the amount of effort

1805
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,160
and we've spoken before about the the

1806
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,640
focus on safety and and the focus on

1807
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,559
mission uh across across all of this

1808
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,640
and there's a there's a really clear

1809
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,839
delineation of

1810
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,520
accountability and responsibility in all

1811
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,119
of those areas

1812
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,200
how do we how do you try and get that

1813
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,040
that thinking across into that boundary

1814
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,880
on the cyber security aspects

1815
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,040
um in this in this area how do we make

1816
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,720
it how do we make cyber security on

1817
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,559
these platforms and these

1818
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,960
launches and integration of um the

1819
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,880
payloads and launch vehicles

1820
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,920
as natural as we think about safety and

1821
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,599
and mission criticality

1822
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,680
yeah that's good good question so you

1823
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,440
know part of it is is standard

1824
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,079
and uh in community which the other

1825
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:20,960
panelists have

1826
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,359
mentioned um you know a big one i think

1827
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,799
is to think about things from an

1828
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,720
adversarial mindset and what

1829
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,240
and also what could the cubesat actually

1830
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,760
do so you could classify threats and the

1831
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,160
paper

1832
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,200
the paper actually does this it

1833
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,119
classifies threats is kind of the

1834
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,720
outside threats where you have no access

1835
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,000
to the hardware you

1836
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,960
you put a um a software a malicious

1837
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,720
software payload into something

1838
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,520
uh versus uh an insider threat that

1839
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,240
actually could

1840
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
could modify and mess with the actual

1841
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,520
hardware so

1842
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,880
so the former has less than it can

1843
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,319
ultimately accomplish i can't i can't

1844
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,440
modify the hardware

1845
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,480
uh remotely um but the latter is much

1846
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,160
more risky right you can end up in jail

1847
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,799
or worse

1848
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,000
if your threat is successful and they

1849
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,760
figure out what happened um and so i

1850
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,359
think if you think about things from

1851
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,520
from the adversarial mindset you can

1852
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,480
limit the

1853
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,880
um the actual realistic threats into a

1854
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,400
into a tractable set of

1855
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,720
of things and and then the community can

1856
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,000
get together and come up with some

1857
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,839
standards around how do you mitigate

1858
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,520
those specific threats that are that are

1859
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,559
practical

1860
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,400
and and and also of course come up with

1861
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,000
well what do we not think of what are

1862
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,480
the other

1863
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,119
uh set of threats that belong there um

1864
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,559
but i think we do that then we can go

1865
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,760
through and classify

1866
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,599
um the threats and the mitigations

1867
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,200
against them into a realistic set and i

1868
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,000
think that would be the key

1869
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
brilliant thank you for that and then

1870
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
and then so finally everything coming to

1871
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,400
you

1872
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,200
is you're you're seeing the growth of

1873
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,839
this area

1874
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,960
you're you're seeing all of that

1875
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,440
collaboration um

1876
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,839
in in sort of sort of casting your eye

1877
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,280
forwards with where

1878
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,720
you've got the space i set going in that

1879
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,480
direction with the community

1880
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,400
um is this is this a is this a goal that

1881
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,599
we think can be achievable

1882
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,200
yeah i'm very optimistic and yeah i

1883
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,720
think right now what it does come down

1884
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,040
to

1885
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,599
is that uh people need more visibility

1886
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,440
on what the threats and vulnerabilities

1887
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,240
are

1888
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,319
and james paper was fantastic for

1889
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,000
creating some of that awareness

1890
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,200
on a specific uh topic and so

1891
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,799
because there are so many other

1892
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,799
opportunities and threat vectors out

1893
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:23,599
there

1894
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,400
and attack uh techniques and tactics

1895
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,359
then

1896
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,680
uh you leveraging the resources that are

1897
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,359
available to the community is the thing

1898
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,040
i would encourage the most and

1899
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,960
so since that's what we're doing every

1900
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,559
day and space ice back is creating

1901
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:37,760
resources then i just

1902
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,400
encourage people to think about what is

1903
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,480
becoming available to them

1904
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,920
through this great platform that we're

1905
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,520
building we have a threat intelligence

1906
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,000
platform

1907
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,079
where we're sharing alerts we have an

1908
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,520
analyst working group

1909
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,000
that meets every month to talk about

1910
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,599
threats and vulnerabilities

1911
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,839
and so creating a forum like that in our

1912
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,280
smallsack community of interest

1913
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,760
is probably the future for sats where

1914
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,720
they have

1915
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,920
uh regular access to that those threat

1916
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,920
briefings we also have

1917
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,559
uh been working with folks that are

1918
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,559
normally not providing information

1919
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,720
previously to

1920
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,480
the general public and they're now

1921
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
willing to speak on threats and

1922
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,599
vulnerabilities to the general public

1923
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,240
recognizing that this information is out

1924
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,000
there and it needs to be

1925
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,359
uh provided we need to provide access to

1926
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,240
it on a larger

1927
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,240
forum or in larger forums sorry

1928
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,760
and you know longer term then spacex

1929
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,280
actually next year we'll have a watch

1930
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,000
center

1931
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,599
and so that watch center will be staffed

1932
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,760
with about five to seven analysts

1933
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,720
and uh we'll pursue other activities we

1934
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,200
have

1935
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,960
great opportunities to do what other

1936
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,960
icesacs have done for their sector

1937
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,520
like create benchmarking and create

1938
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,640
cyber hardened

1939
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,040
uh platforms to make those available to

1940
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,240
their sector

1941
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,720
and make it easier for small businesses

1942
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,599
and

1943
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,000
uh university type settings to be able

1944
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,520
to have access to

1945
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,880
uh lower cost resources

1946
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,720
yeah erin thanks and that all sounds

1947
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,200
really exciting and i think that

1948
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,880
i think that also it's not just that

1949
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,160
small stack community that you've got in

1950
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
the space isaac it's also you've got the

1951
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,559
big

1952
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,720
industry space players in there as well

1953
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,079
um which i think is

1954
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,000
is really great and and that is uh if

1955
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,359
you look at the breadth and depth of

1956
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,880
that community i think that there's a

1957
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,319
there's a lot there

1958
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,359
so i mean panel that's been amazing um

1959
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,599
james and team uh great piece of

1960
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,480
research

1961
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,200
um and and i think to sort of summarize

1962
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,760
is that

1963
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,960
it still feels that we're in the

1964
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,280
foothills of talking about this as a

1965
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,319
as a as a great and innovative and

1966
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,720
fascinating area for not not just

1967
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,559
research but also building up that

1968
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,680
thinking and that and that

1969
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,240
and that sort of set of people that

1970
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,920
really understand this this intersection

1971
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,839
between space and cyber security

1972
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,160
because we're equally dependent on both

1973
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:54,880
really this

1974
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,559
uh going forwards um so

1975
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,640
lots to talk about going forward but

1976
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,160
also we've given lots of really good i

1977
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,599
think insight to

1978
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,359
um all the different areas where people

1979
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,200
can actually go and see more um

1980
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,440
about it and and read into james's

1981
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,559
research

1982
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,680
so thank you um to all of you um

1983
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,720
have a great great rest of cycle

1984
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,680
um and thanks to you and this icon team

1985
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,079
so

1986
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,760
now there is going to be a short

1987
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,000
20-minute break um and then at

1988
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,200
17 20 there'll be a great discussion

1989
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,720
with the representatives of the u.s

1990
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,400
subspace slaring commission that you'll

1991
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,440
be able to follow on

1992
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,960
stage one i've been uh cooper and this

1993
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,440
has been

1994
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,760
cyber space cubed with an amazing set of

1995
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,880
panelists so thank you very much

1996
