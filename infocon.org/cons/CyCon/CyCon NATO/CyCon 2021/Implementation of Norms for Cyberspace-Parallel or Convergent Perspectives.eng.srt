ccdcoe law branch

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
your moderator for for this session

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
welcome to second day one and our cyber

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
norms panel

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
i must admit upfront that out of all

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
years to miss cyclone

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
at least this year i can offer you the

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
cheap consolation of the weather being

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
ridiculously rainy and snowy

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,399
not snowy but stormy outside the

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
yacht-crowded

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
hub next to us looking rather sad and

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
and the nordic white house renowned

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
cafes next door being relatively empty

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,079
so if you had to miss

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,039
a year in thailand uh i'm glad it's this

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,319
one

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
so uh of course it's a it's poor solace

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,560
uh

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
thinking of uh it's every otherwise

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,240
every bit as charming

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
spring in thailand the city is finally

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,280

unique perspectives

to discuss the norms rules and

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
principles for the conduct

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
of states and not just states but also

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,720
other actors

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,840
in cyberspace towards ensuring a

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
stable safe and secure cyber environment

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,520

welcome to the panelists

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,439
hoffmann

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,399
mr vladimir radonovich and mr rahman

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:22,000
singh chima

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
so the session will come at cyberspace

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
with a

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
year and a half of a pandemic behind us

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
we are more digital than ever uh on

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
every layer of society well perhaps

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
the military which which is probably

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
defying change it seems

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
but on but every cyber incident response

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,239
team you ask

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,440
reports in increased levels of low

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,080
intensity

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
malicious cyber activities now the

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,599
question is has the

65
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
accelerated digitalization and the

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,519
subsequent

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
realization of our own vulnerability and

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
digital dependency

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
also accelerated the crystallization of

70
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
cyber norms

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
and if so then how we have three

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
different perspectives on the

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
on the panel today that of states that

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,599
of industry

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,440
and of civil society and before we hand

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
the floor over to the

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
speakers uh i'd like to

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,800
lay out some some house rules so the

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
speakers will

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
present their work for uh 12 to 15

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,319
minutes per

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,959
paper or intervention and followed by

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,560
possibly a short question

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,879
from me and then we will have a q a

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
session towards the

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
end of the session and to the audience

87

very rainy day so it's

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
a good thing to be inside rather than

133

the cyber pandemic

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
a plea for international law and the

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
rule of sovereignty in cyberspace

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
and i would like to thank the organizer

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280

due to the situation as well as for the

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
publication of the proceeding

146
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
as you mentioned i am a researcher at

147
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
esm which is a research center of the

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,560
french ministry of defense

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
so i wanted to make clear that i am

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
talking today in my personal capacity

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
and not in the name of esm or the

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
ministry

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
the objective of my chapter is to

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,759
analyze

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
the coving 19 cyber pandemic through the

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,440
lens of

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
international law and with a space focus

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,280
on the rule of sovereignty in cyberspace

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
in that sense one of the main focus

160
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
of the article of the chapter

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,960
is to assess whether the alleged state

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,280
conducted or state-sponsored cyber

163
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
operation

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,680
taking place during the pandemic um

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
constitute internationally wrongful acts

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
and more precisely breaches

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
of the rule of sovereignty building on

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
this assessment

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,280
i am also reflecting on what

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
it can tell us about the framework of

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
responsible state behavior

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
and in particular on the evolution of

173
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
the internal law applicable to cyber

174
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
operations

175
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,440
let's start with the cyber pandemic

176
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
the cyber pandemic uh takes mainly two

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
forms we

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
on the one hand we saw cyber threat

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
taking advantage

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
of uh the pandemic induced crisis indeed

181
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
the digitalization of our lives for work

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,840
entertainment but also staying in touch

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
with our friends and family has

184
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
increased the possible surface of attack

185
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,199
and we have witnesses for instance cyber

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
operation targeting video conferencing

187
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
systems

188
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
the second category that we saw the

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
second form are

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
cyber threats directed at the hills care

191
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
sector and that

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
institutions involved in the management

193
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,759
of the crisis

194
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
for instance we saw cyber operation

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
conducted by dark hotel

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
or ocean lotus against chinese and

197
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
international

198
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,599
institutions involved in the crisis

199
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
management we also witnesses

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
cyber operation against the world its

201
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,759
organization

202
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,840
it seems that a lot of this cyber

203
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,879
operation

204
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
end that gathering information on the

205
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
spread of the virus what was the

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,400
situation

207
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
um understand more what was happening

208
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
we saw also on that kind of the second

209
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
stage

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
um a new race a new wave of uh

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,599
cyber operation targeting institution

212
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,440
richard center involved

213
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
uh in the vaccine race and that was also

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
an interesting evolution

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
what is interesting when we talk about

216
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
uh these two categories i'm very sorry

217
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
and there is also the third category

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
which i'm not

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
uh studying in the article which is the

220
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,679
emphademic

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
on that they're always been some

222
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,279
interesting articles and

223
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
i would like to cite the one by barry

224
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
sanders on nicolas sagurias

225
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
which was published in the journal of

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
international humanitarian

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,600
legal studies so i will not um

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
work on that in this presentation this

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
is not part of turn that i'm focusing on

230
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
the cyber operation the cyber pandemic

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
what i wanted to say on the two

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,839
categories is

233
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
conversely to the first form the second

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
category has led to some accusation by

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
state that

236
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
some of the states were responsible for

237
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
conducting or sponsoring

238
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
cyber operation directed at health care

239
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
sector and other institutions involved

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
in the crisis management

241
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920
and that's interesting observation uh

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
then if we move on the question of

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
international law

244
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
and uh how the international committee

245
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
has reacted indeed

246
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
we have witnesses and we saw

247
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
uh different initiative and declaration

248
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,120
by state to recall the importance of

249
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
international law and the framework of

250
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,600
responsible state behavior

251
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
to deal with cyber threats and in

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,600
particular saturated with the pandemic

253
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,839
uh we are two hour formula meetings at

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,760
the u.n security council in may and

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
august 2020

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
we also had unilateral declaration by

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
several states

258
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
including an international organization

259
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
including the european union

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
in april 2020 however

261
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
when we study the concrete example of

262
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,279
cyber operations that have been

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,680
condemned or attributed by state to

264
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,800
other states

265
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
there is no mention by the attributing

266
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,240
states

267
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
of international law and of which full

268
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
of international has been breached and

269
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,839
that's interesting because we see kind

270
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
of a discrepancy between

271
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,320
the general disclose of states which are

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,279
attached to

273
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,519
international law as one of the

274
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,920
cornerstones for peace and stability of

275
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,160
cyberspace but at the same time we don't

276
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,560
see

277
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
translating into their practice on

278
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,000
actual

279
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,279
cases of cyber operation

280
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
studying the discrepancy between the

281
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
discourse and the practice is one of the

282
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
objectives of the paper

283
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
which led in the in the chapter it's led

284
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,120
me

285
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
to analyze what is interest

286
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,079
how international applied to cyberspace

287
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
so i will not detail that here but

288
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
states have already declared that they

289
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
recognize the applicability of

290
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
international law

291
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880
it was recognized by the ungge

292
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,079
in its report in 2013 and then confirmed

293
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,560
by

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,839
most states in their uh defense

295
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
you had also several natives to work on

296
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
the content of international law here i

297
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
put the talent manuals one and two

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,720
which were great initiatives sponsored

299
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,959
uh by the ccdcoe

300
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
so that's uh also a bit of the context

301
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
of the article

302
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,000
what we have also is we saw in the

303
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
recent year two interesting evolution in

304
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
state practice related to the

305
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
international applicable to cyber

306
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
operation

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
and the one and the growing number of

308
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,839
states releasing

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
publicly what is their view on the

310
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
international applicable to cyberspace

311
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
the only thing here is for now we have

312
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
only a limited number of states

313
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
less than 20 and also most of them are

314
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
western state

315
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
so that's also a partial geographical

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
picture

317
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
so which is the thing is that state

318
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,839
startingly developing

319
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,519
and strengthening their practice in

320
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
conducting but also in reacting to cyber

321
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
operation

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
but here we can do we can have the same

323
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
assessment that i just the same

324
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
observations that i just mentioned

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,920
is as it is the case with copied related

326
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
cyber operation

327
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
in general in bingo cyber operation

328
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
states make no use of international law

329
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
nor their explain

330
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
on which international rule have been

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,480
breached

332
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,440
by the behavior

333
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
so one of the objectives as i say is to

334
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,680
question

335
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
the reason for that and in the paper

336
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,519
talking about the whole international

337
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,600
law about the world process to apply

338
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
international which i have summarized on

339
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,440
this

340
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,880
first shot published two years ago

341
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
but i am focusing on the question on

342
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,240
whether or not

343
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
a cyber operation may constitute an

344
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,120
internationally wrongful cyber act

345
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,839
which are conditions it must be able to

346
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,399
estate

347
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,720
i am not focusing on that but i'm

348
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
focusing on the second

349
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
condition which is to constitute a

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,440
breach of an

351
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,079
international obligation and in the

352
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,120
chapter i

353
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
am diving into the prohibition of the

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
use of force on thread of four the

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,600
prohibition of

356
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
intervention and the rule of sovereignty

357
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
and the conclusion of this

358
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,839
uh study the conclusion of this

359
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
assessment is actually that

360
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,040
the vast majority of cyber operations

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
and all the examples of cyber operation

362
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
we have during the copy 19 pandemic

363
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,399
are so far not constituting a use of

364
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,279
force

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
or threat of force most

366
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
don't have recessive elements that will

367
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
allow to qualify

368
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
them as unlawful interventions

369
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
but most of them have actually the

370
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
elements that could make them

371
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
constituting breaches of sovereignty uh

372
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
why because most of them are penetrating

373
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
into computer systems of

374
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
other states with an objective to steal

375
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
or at least to

376
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,959
sorry to access and to steal to data so

377
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,279
it's

378
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
why in the paper i have this focus on

379
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,560
sovereignty

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
and i have this focus on sovereignty in

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,399
the conclusion of the paper

382
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
when we talk about sovereignty uh in

383
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,959
international the prohibition

384
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
of the violation of territorial

385
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
sovereignty in cyberspace what is

386
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,040
interesting

387
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,079
is in one of the most let's say debated

388
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
uh rule or principle of international

389
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,480
law with some state considering that

390
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
it's only a principle on that the rule

391
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
is only the rule of unlawful

392
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
intervention when there is a coercive

393
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
element

394
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
that's a british approach um also states

395
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
considering that it's a rule but then we

396
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,519
see three different

397
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
approaches remain different approaches

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,560
which is

399
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
for some state penetration based

400
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,600
approach

401
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
uh any penetration into a computer

402
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
system could be considered as a

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
violation of sovereignty that's for

404
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,160
example the

405
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
project france adopted we have also

406
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
all the states that decided to adopt

407
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,560
what we call

408
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
the minimum approach which is to say

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
that you need

410
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
in addition to the penetration a certain

411
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
threshold of arm

412
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,240
it's also the approach that was adopted

413
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
in the tallinn manual

414
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
and then you have also another approach

415
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
which was in the italian manual and

416
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
which has been adopted

417
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
uh by netherland which is to say that

418
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
there are also cases of interference or

419
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
observation of inherently governmental

420
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,720
functions

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
that constitute violation of sovereignty

422
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,839
so what is interesting when you analyze

423
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,519
the examples that we have from the

424
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
coving 19 pandemic

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
is most of all of them

426
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
up into like most of them sorry are

427
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
penetrating into computer systems so

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
according to the penetration based

429
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
approach they will constitute violation

430
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,680
of sovereignty

431
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,880
but actually most of them may not

432
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
uh meet the threshold of arms that is

433
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,160
requested

434
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,880
and then most of them may not constitute

435
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
unlawful

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
attempt to violate sovereignty and

437
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,800
that's interesting conclusion

438
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
which is made to the conclusion of the

439
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
paper which

440
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
is to say that the assessment of the

441
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
lawfulness of the cyber operations that

442
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
take advantage of the

443
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,279
v9 pandemic confirmed made changes

444
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,959
is not the identification of the

445
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
relevant norms or the principle of

446
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
international law but rather the

447
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
interpretation and implementation by

448
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,839
states

449
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,519
so we have the rules in place but the

450
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
question is how states are applying them

451
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,240
or interpreting them

452
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,240
which um sorry which i like so welcome

453
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
that i already made

454
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
which is the cyber operation during the

455
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
kobe 19 pandemic are not really

456
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
different to what we see outside of the

457
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
pandemic

458
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
but what is different is actually the

459
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
fact that there is an increase in the

460
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:49,759
number

461
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,959
and also there is an increase in tension

462
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,440
over the victim of this cyber operation

463
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,560
and that's a very

464
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,240
uh interesting element

465
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
building on these on these elements i am

466
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:03,920
um

467
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,039
sorry i am saying that it i liked two

468
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
incurrent elements

469
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,880
in two in coherent elementary in the

470
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
approach of some state on the

471
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
international law applicable to cyber

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
operation

473
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
which are also present and highlighted

474
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,079
in the context of the cyber pandemic

475
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,880
firstly some states have adopted an

476
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
approach by adding a requirement

477
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,120
for a threshold of um for a violation of

478
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
sovereignty and that's kind of original

479
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
because we don't see

480
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
certain show requirements in the real

481
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
world and at the same time there is a

482
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,520
dilemma

483
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
existing between peace and stability in

484
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
cyberspace

485
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,679
uh strong notably the condemnation and

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,640
attribution of

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,280
unfriendly and unlawful cyber operation

488
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
and the willingness are the other

489
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
end of state to avoid legal constraints

490
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
on some activities such as cyber

491
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,960
espionage

492
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,679
and using the example of the us practice

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
over solar winds but also the different

494
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,799
forward strategy

495
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
i sure our state may adopt a different

496
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
approach from a legal point of view but

497
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,480
also

498
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
from an acceptability point of view over

499
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,280
a similar type of operation

500
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,160
depending on which side the state is

501
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
placed

502
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
such as situations leads to kind of a

503
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,960
blurring

504
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
of the lines the legal lines between

505
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
lawful and unlawful behavior

506
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,919
and contribute to the erosion of the

507
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,919
international rule-based order or at

508
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,320
least

509
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
it's what we may see as a risk which is

510
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,520
an approach and this is the conclusion

511
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
of the paper which is also the

512
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,679
conclusion of my

513
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,320
presentation today i'm happy to discuss

514
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,720
my

515
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840
my chapter with you

516
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,799
contextualization of the legal rules we

517
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,440
must

518
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
must make work for uh to tackle the

519
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
cyber pandemic

520
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,919
uh i have one quick question for you

521
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
before we move on to the next

522
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,480
presentation

523
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
would you imagine a shift of legal

524
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
qualification of cyber attacks as the

525
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
impact of cyber operations increases

526
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,160
due to society's drastically grown

527
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
digital dependency

528
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
during the pandemic

529
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
yes i i think that's a very interesting

530
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,200
question

531
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
and what that's one of the elements

532
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
i want to show in the in this chapter

533
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,679
with this idea that at the end the cyber

534
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,960
operation we have witnessed

535
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
are not really different from what we

536
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
usually see but the difference

537
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,520
is there is a growing intention from

538
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
state and from the public over the

539
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,080
victims

540
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
and thus a growing uh

541
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
awareness of the risk and i believe that

542
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,039
such a situation may actually

543
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,400
incentivize

544
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
some state maybe and also international

545
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,760
organization

546
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,799
to push for a stricter approach on

547
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,640
sovereignty and maybe a more inclusive

548
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,840
approach on sovereignty

549
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,039
thanks this does tempt me to your next

550
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,480
question but i will

551
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
i will leave you in suspense hopefully

552
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
we have more time to discuss towards the

553
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,440
end of the session

554
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,159
thank you very much again franza and i'd

555
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
like to move on to the next presentation

556
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600

proceedings article

559
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
which assesses the impact that good

560
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
corporate practices

561
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
for digital product security could have

562
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,679
on global cyber

563
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,600

thank you so much kadri for the kind

627
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,919
introduction

628
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,240
uh i will start off this presentation

629
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
and then i will hand over to vladimir

630
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,960
um yeah so thanks thanks a lot for the

631
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
good organization the introduction

632
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,280
um great to be in tallinn if only

633
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,159
virtual um

634
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
it has been a while i've been there

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
physically but maybe next year

636
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
um so let me start taking you away a bit

637
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
from the state uh

638
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
perspective that we've just had um and

639
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:14,960
look at the

640
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
look at the private sector so

641
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,640
what is what is our argument that that

642
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
we are trying that we are trying to make

643
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
today

644
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,799
um the first the first point in our

645
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,360
argument

646
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
is that vulnerabilities in digital

647
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,640
products

648
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,000
are um essential or an essential part of

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
many sophisticated cyber attacks

650
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
or and also not so sophisticated ones

651
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
that we are seeing

652
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
today and those cyber attacks obviously

653
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
have an impact on global cyber stability

654
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,400
um we also look at multilateral norms

655
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
that have been developed at the

656
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,760
un level for example that also identify

657
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
vulnerabilities and digital products as

658
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,480
being

659
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,880
source of um as being the source of

660
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,520
insecurities and also address those

661
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,919
vulnerabilities

662
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
with with some prescriptions for states

663
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,639
and other actors

664
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,159
and then we are zooming in into

665
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,480
good corporate practices as one of the

666
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,760
cures for

667
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
these vulnerabilities and digital

668
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
products so

669
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,000
the the argument is like um on the one

670
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,520
hand we have these vulnerabilities that

671
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
are contributing to

672
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
cyber attacks and so we need to

673
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
work with the private sector to um

674
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,760
improve the practices um for developing

675
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,400
and and

676
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
uh disseminating the products that they

677
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,159
are developing

678
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,799
to make them more secure to to reduce

679
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,520
the

680
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
risk of cyber attacks

681
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
and then in the end we will also discuss

682
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,120
how to support the wider adoption of

683
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,159
those good practices um throughout the

684
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,400
supply chain worldwide

685
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,559
so let me zoom in now and two into the

686
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,640
argument

687
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,919
what is global cyberstability um

688
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
we are using partly the definition of

689
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
the global commission on the stability

690
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
of the cyberspace

691
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,320
which takes a pretty broad view and

692
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,520
states

693
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
cyber stability is a situation where the

694
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,320
availability and integrity of services

695
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
in and through cyberspace are generally

696
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
assured where change is managed in a

697
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
relative piece

698
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
and where tangents are resolved in non

699
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
in a non-escalatory manner

700
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
so note that this definition is pretty

701
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
right

702
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
it is wider than the question of cyber

703
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
peace or armed conflict

704
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
or even apt attacks but looks at the

705
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,159
availability integrity in in general of

706
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,080
digital of of cyberspace

707
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
um and then looking at the next question

708
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
how to reach cyber stability can states

709
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,840
solve the problem

710
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,960
on their own we just

711
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,039
heard from from francois the different

712
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
views that states hold on

713
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,679
sovereignty in cyberspace and and how it

714
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
applies

715
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,039
what constitutes the breach and so on um

716
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
and this these discussions have been

717
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
taken place

718
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,760
um obviously many states are um

719
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
voicing their opinion on this in in in

720
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,120
the papers that they put out

721
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,520
but they have also been discussing this

722
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
at the un

723
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,640
uh since 2004 so for almost so for 18

724
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,279
years now

725
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,919
almost 20 years now so what we have seen

726
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,240
so far was the adoption of 11 voluntary

727
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,039
norms of responsible state behavior

728
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,960
that have been set out in the report of

729
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,039
the 2013 to 15 you and group of

730
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
governmental experts on cyber ict

731
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
security

732
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,600
and these norms have been further

733
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
strengthened

734
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,480
by the report of the first open ended

735
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
working group

736
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,159
under the u.n general assembly that has

737
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,039
it was agreed upon this march

738
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,159
and in this report we also see

739
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,000
that states have underscored the value

740
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,159
of further strengthening collaboration

741
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,440
with other actors such as civil society

742
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,559
the private sector academia and the

743
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,520
technical community

744
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
and also if we look at what states do

745
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
below the international level

746
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,200
we recognize that regulation and

747
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
standardization in the area of cyber

748
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,559
security

749
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
is still very necessary and uneven and

750
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
has also difficulty coping with rapid

751
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
technological change and

752
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,159
also has the problem that if you put up

753
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,200
new barriers

754
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,679
new regulations then the products will

755
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,240
be

756
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
more expensive and and this also has a

757
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
disincentive to

758
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,840
kind of uh uh go further in with regard

759
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,399
to uh to traditional standardization and

760
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,880
regulation so there's now broad

761
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
recognition that states cannot ensure

762
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
the stability of cyberspace without

763
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,679
collaboration with other stakeholders

764
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,520
the private sector is clearly the most

765
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
important because digital products are

766
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,960
being

767
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,679
developed maintained and secured by by

768
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,279
this private sector and the technical

769
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,200
community

770
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
so let's look a bit closer at the norms

771
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,279
that i just outlined

772
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,200
they also contained proposals that would

773
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,640
need collaboration with the private

774
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
sector and their realization

775
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,799
such as the norm to protect the

776
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,720
integrity of the supply chain

777
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,559
so that end users can have confidence in

778
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
the security of ict products

779
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
or to encourage the responsible

780
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,720
reporting of vulnerabilities that's also

781
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
something that states have to do

782
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,760
in in or in unison or in collaboration

783
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,919
with the private sector

784
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
even as though as those norms do not

785
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,440
directly encourage

786
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,679
development of secure products it is

787
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,520
reasonable to assume that the integrity

788
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
of the supply chain is also

789
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,559
encompasses um digital products because

790
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,440
if you look at

791
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,919
the formulation that end users can have

792
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,600
confidence in the security of ict

793
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
products

794
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
the product dimension is clearly

795
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
addressed here

796
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,720
so um then we also have other the gcsc i

797
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
mentioned at the beginning the global

798
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,120
commission

799
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
they also uh take a multi-stakeholder

800
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,640
view and

801
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
and echo some of these norms that have

802
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
been developed at the un level

803
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
the paris call is of course a mighty

804
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
stakeholder initiative

805
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,360
has also a principle on security

806
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
principle number six

807
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
and the charter of trust which is an

808
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
industry initiative

809
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,240
also looks at this naturally so in our

810
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,960
paper we

811
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
we take a multi-stakeholder approach or

812
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
perspective on global sub-stability

813
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,159
we argue specifically that cyber

814
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,159
stability can be enhanced if the private

815
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,399
sector is assisting and implementation

816
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,240
of these above-mentioned norms by

817
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,760
improving the security of digital of the

818
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,159
digital products

819
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,120
so why do we look specifically at this

820
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,000
corporate practices for digital products

821
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,440
um let me uh highlight also in the covet

822
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,159
19 pandemic and we heard about the

823
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
um the cyber pandemic and so on

824
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,320
before um

825
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480
when there were incidents and even apt

826
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,960
incidents have been on the rise

827
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,200
and they often leverage insecurities in

828
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,799
digital products

829
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,799
let me give you just three examples most

830
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,320
recently the colonial

831
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,039
pipeline ransomware incident we do not

832
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,919
yet know

833
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
that the exact attack vector but the

834
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
threat actor that has been identified to

835
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
be behind this attack

836
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,399
has exploited the vulnerability in sonic

837
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,960
wall firewalls in the past

838
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
um then secondly the solarwinds hack

839
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
that created the backdoor to about 18

840
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,080
000 entities

841
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
including the u.s government and

842
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,600
research facilities

843
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,960
via the update process of of this um

844
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,399
of this software um here attackers

845
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,240
gained initial access via an insecure

846
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
password

847
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
which could have been prevented using

848
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,679
security by design practices

849
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,480
and also conversely the breach was

850
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,159
detected only by

851
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,279
very well maintained practices of

852
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,559
two-factor authentication because when

853
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,679
it wasn't detected by by fire only when

854
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
uh an employee apparently wanted to

855
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
register a second phone for

856
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,840
two-factor authentication and then they

857
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
were made aware of this attack so this

858
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,880
shows that

859
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,559
that also good practices can uh

860
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
help detecting attacks and and that

861
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
detects can be prevented by

862
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,559
uh better practices another well-known

863
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,559
incident are the four zebra they exploit

864
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,320
in microsoft exchange server this year

865
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
those have been used very widely also

866
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,320
after the patches has been had been

867
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
issued by microsoft

868
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
as part of the vulnerability management

869
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,440
process

870
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,760
as many small organizations so even

871
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
bigger ones have difficulties in

872
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,039
patching in a timely manner so this also

873
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,720
shows that it's important to upfront

874
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,799
secure digital products and not only

875
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,279
patch them afterwards so from these

876
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,840
examples

877
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,760
it's clear that if digital products are

878
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
being developed in a more secure way it

879
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
will be more difficult to conduct such

880
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
attacks

881
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,039
and yeah vlada will now

882
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,080
take you further into the the practices

883
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
that we developed as part of the geneva

884
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,360
dialogue

885
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,640
and i hand it over to him thanks

886
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
thank you honest and uh thank you kadri

887
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,840
for the invitation i

888
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,320
it's pretty that our third uh author

889
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,919
marielle is not here because we would

890
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,159
strike a little bit of a gender balance

891
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,519
but that means that there are ladies

892
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,960
which are involved in this research as

893
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,600
well

894
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
uh one of the main goals of of our paper

895
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,640
is as

896
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,679
jonah said was basically to connect

897
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,200
the aspects of vulnerabilities and

898
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
security of products with cyber

899
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
stability because

900
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,480
our impression is that it's not so often

901
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,039
done

902
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,120
for instance um it's it's often

903
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
discussed uh separately within the the

904
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,799
norms focus there is

905
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
not enough focus on vulnerability and

906
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,880
exploiting vulnerabilities and basically

907
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,279
uh keeping the whole cyber cyberspace uh

908
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,480
less vulnerable

909
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,760
and at the same time in the business

910
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,080
communities there is a lack of broader

911
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,200
understanding of

912
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
how vulnerabilities impact stability

913
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,320
it's not just about their

914
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,159
reputation and accountability it's a

915
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
much much bigger stake

916
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
and if we look at uh various type of

917
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,840
attacks

918
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,240
uh the vulnerabilities play an important

919
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
role also in these models about

920
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
sophisticated attacks such as the the

921
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
meter attack or or the

922
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,799
uh the the kill chain and so on by

923
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,000
locking martin

924
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
there are a number of papers as well

925
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
within the gcsc

926
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,919
briefings also which connect the

927
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,960
offensive cyber capabilities to um

928
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,600
to exploiting vulnerability so basically

929
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,399
the goal is

930
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,519
reducing vulnerabilities can lead to

931
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,440
increasing costs of conducting attacks

932
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,799
which in turn

933
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,880
can certainly impact stability and we

934
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,840
need

935
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,760
products which are more secure now

936
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,519
moving on to uh

937
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,360
to good practices and this whole

938
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
research is being developed within the

939
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
context

940
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
of the geneva dialogue on responsible

941
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,279
behavior which is basically

942
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,960
um sort of an issue initiative by by

943
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,919
diplo foundation

944
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,640
and the fdfa with the particular

945
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
participation of the private sector and

946
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,640
that's

947
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,239
where we come back to the to the

948
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,159
positions and roles of private sectors

949
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,918
just name a couple of them which are

950
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
which are well known um they include the

951
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,119
abb uh by zone which is part of

952
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,040
cisco firearm and kaspersky microsoft

953
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,399
ncr siemens tata consultancy ubs

954
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,159
so companies are really around the world

955
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,918
which which were involved in

956
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,560
discussions about their good practices

957
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
and these discussions in the last

958
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,199
year and a half now revolve around

959
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,440
security by design or

960
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
how do we embed security from the from

961
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,800
the

962
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,359
beginning of planning of digital product

963
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,960
and what are some of the good practices

964
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,560
that that stand out

965
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,239
the report by the geneva dialogue of

966
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,320
last year outlines

967
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
five general chunks of good practices

968
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,079
which includes

969
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,480
threat modeling um supply chain and

970
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,240
third party security particularly

971
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,119
knowing

972
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
what's in your product and what's now

973
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
becoming a buzzword is

974
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,079
bill of material and software bill of

975
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,160
material we see that in the executive

976
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
order by the u.s as well

977
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,240
these days then secure development

978
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,200
deployment

979
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
including securing the aspects of

980
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
developing the code and

981
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
and pushing the updates which is exactly

982
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
what was the problem in solarwinds

983
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,040
uh then the vulnerability processes

984
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
vulnerability management vulnerability

985
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,839
disclosure

986
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,240
which doesn't limit only to uh to

987
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
companies it also involves the

988
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,760
mediators the search the government the

989
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
regulatory environment and so on

990
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,359
and then adjusting the mindsets which

991
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
means involving the sea level of the

992
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,720
companies across

993
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,440
working across departments and so on uh

994
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
but then

995
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,320
uh i won't go into details we can

996
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
certainly get back to these more

997
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,320
technical details if there is interest

998
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,680
but then the question is how do we move

999
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
towards a greater implementation of

1000
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,000
these let's say good practices and how

1001
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,839
do we connect the dots basically

1002
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,800
and a couple of features that impact

1003
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,480
this this environment

1004
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
uh one is the complexity of supply chain

1005
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,640
we have more and more open source

1006
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,720
uh code the third-party components so

1007
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,400
there is a lack of understanding of this

1008
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
bill of material

1009
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,400
of understanding what is in a particular

1010
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
product even by vendors

1011
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,359
then the national security

1012
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,960
considerations where security is

1013
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
becoming uh cyber security is becoming

1014
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,119
uh

1015
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
a political issue part of regulate

1016
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
regulatory environment laws

1017
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,359
then the the new critical actors

1018
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,040
particularly during the covet crisis

1019
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,520
where

1020
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,760
we have you know actors like zoom if you

1021
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
wish and and others

1022
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
uh which suddenly become sort of a

1023
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,599
critical part of the supply chain and

1024
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,160
again

1025
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,560
the u.s executive order recently uh

1026
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
mentions the the the critical

1027
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
software what is a critical software so

1028
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
the new players on the board how do we

1029
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
involve them

1030
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,079
and what we outlined was the four major

1031
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
blocks that we have to take into

1032
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,560
consideration

1033
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,400
corporate practices certainly has been

1034
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,560
maybe the fastest ones but then they're

1035
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,760
based on standards

1036
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
which are maybe not fast enough now

1037
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
anymore or not overarch arching

1038
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,320
regulatory environment which is popping

1039
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,839
up and it's not always

1040
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,520
in sync with standards and with other

1041
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,680
developments we see it in singapore in

1042
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,760
european union and finland the other

1043
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,880
places

1044
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
norms and principles which we which we

1045
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
mentioned so the open question one of

1046
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
the open questions is

1047
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
how do we connect these dots how do we

1048
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,520
put them in sync

1049
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,280
and then we do whether we need some sort

1050
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680
of a baseline security requirements that

1051
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,280
we would all agree upon

1052
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,119
which might come out of the practice

1053
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,960
good practices they have to be in sync

1054
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
with the

1055
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
with the standards they have to also

1056
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,359
help standards to be developed

1057
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,200
but they might be even playing a role of

1058
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
light standards to help

1059
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
those that can't follow standards but

1060
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,240
they are critical as

1061
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,440
smes as uh open source communities as

1062
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,280
startups which are developing pieces of

1063
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,480
code and products

1064
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,280
to catch up and then boost the security

1065
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,960
of their product so that's an open

1066
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
question

1067
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,720
and just to to conclude with the with

1068
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,520
the maybe a

1069
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,720
a quick summary of uh what are the

1070
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,920
takeaways

1071
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,240
so enhancing the security of of digital

1072
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,119
products

1073
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
basically can increase the cost of cyber

1074
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,160
attacks

1075
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,520
we need um private sector to

1076
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,160
help implementing this boosting of

1077
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,200
security of

1078
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,320
products and thus the norms as well

1079
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,640
and certainly geneva dialogue has put up

1080
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,440
some

1081
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,839
uh good practices but we continue

1082
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,800
discussing

1083
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,599
this triangle or four components and how

1084
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,079
to

1085
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,240
sync them better uh better together but

1086
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,599
i invite you to

1087
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,680
visit the website and uh and happy to

1088
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,040
discuss more back to you country thank

1089
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,920
you

1090
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,200
thank you vlada thanks jonas thanks for

1091
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
to both of you for this convincing case

1092
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
of uh of the private sector's role not

1093
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,839
just towards

1094
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,960
enhancing uh product cyber security or

1095
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,440
service

1096
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,200
security but towards sustaining and

1097
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,440
promoting global cyber stability

1098
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,680
which of course is a topic that the last

1099
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
year has put into a lot more

1100
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,319
urgency

1101
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
i was going to ask a quick quick

1102
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
question realizing it's not really a

1103
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,880
quick question

1104
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,680
but in any case in contrast to states

1105
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
who seem to be dragging their feet

1106
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,000
somewhat

1107
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
when it comes to commitments there's

1108
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,599
been private sector

1109
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,760
induced and initiated

1110
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
initiatives to raise the security of the

1111
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,839
digital ecosystem

1112
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,200
protecting users empowering

1113
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,359
product and service providers refusing

1114
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,079
from undermining

1115
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,160
security under government pressure for

1116
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,839
for example

1117
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,640
to which now triple number of digit of

1118
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
companies

1119
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
including global vendors and online

1120
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,240
platforms have signed up to

1121
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,280
so you describe the geneva dialogue

1122
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,680
which

1123
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,200
translates high-level

1124
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
abstract principles into day-to-day

1125
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,400
operations

1126
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
and admittedly their initiative has

1127
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,160
recently concluded and that

1128
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,839
there's not yet a whole lot of practice

1129
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,320
to speak of but do you see this

1130
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,200
geneva dialogue initiative faring better

1131
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,480
in terms of actual commitments than the

1132
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,079
u.n

1133
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,520
norms of responsible state behavior

1134
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
where there's obviously a lot of talk of

1135
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
how an ideal world should look like but

1136
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
rather little commitment uh by states to

1137
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,359
actually follow those rules

1138
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,960
by themselves rather than expecting that

1139
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
everybody else should play by the rules

1140
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,400
yeah thank thank you kadri um

1141
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
thanks for this question which is really

1142
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,119
sums up nicely also our our intention

1143
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,960
with the geneva dialogue

1144
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
um well i have to say we are part of

1145
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,640
we see this as part of the efforts that

1146
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,000
states are undertaking

1147
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,440
to uh to enhance cyber stability

1148
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,599
and yes there are a number of there are

1149
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,000
a number of initiatives around by by the

1150
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
private sector

1151
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,480
but uh they have to be i think and we

1152
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,599
think they have to be

1153
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,960
more inclusive reflecting reflecting uh

1154
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
private sector actors from all around

1155
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,240
the world

1156
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,480
that's what we're trying to do and

1157
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
talking about the

1158
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,280
implementation yes that's um something

1159
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
we try to achieve step by step

1160
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,680
um and that's the practical approach

1161
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
that we are trying to

1162
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,079
that we are trying to push forward um

1163
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,119
with the geneva dialogue and um

1164
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,280
as vlada said this year we are working

1165
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359
further um not only on good practices

1166
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,720
but also on

1167
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,599
um some baseline recommendations that

1168
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,079
that

1169
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
then could be applied uh further down

1170
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,040
down the road and and this would be

1171
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,920
promising because as i said in the

1172
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
beginning the private sector really has

1173
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,760
the boots on the ground if you wish to

1174
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,920
to make change happen whereas

1175
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,800
states of course they are setting the

1176
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,200
the

1177
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,319
overall um regulatory

1178
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,280
boundaries and they are really powerful

1179
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,920
actors

1180
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
if they if they want to but they are not

1181
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,359
developing digital products by

1182
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,839
themselves

1183
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
mostly

1184
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,119
thank you and thanks again for the

1185
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,359
for the excellent presentation uh we are

1186
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,240
i see

1187
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
some questions coming from the audience

1188
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,680
i will

1189
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,960
we are trying to leave some space

1190
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,440
towards the end for for discussion also

1191
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,960
so uh next up uh we will have

1192
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,800
mr ramon jitsink chima

1193
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,960
who represents the the perspective that

1194
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,160
i'm really glad to

1195
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,800
include or to have included in this

1196
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,760
year's cycle

1197
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
namely one from the civil society and

1198
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,880
he will be laying out the progress of

thank you so much country it's been a

1244
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,079
pleasure to be here and to be able to

1245
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,520
follow an excellent series of

1246
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,280
interventions by many speakers who

1247
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,640
touched upon many of the points i hope

1248
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,359
to cover

1249
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,800
but i want to go back a bit to the

1250
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,560
beginning of what you mentioned in terms

1251
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:32,960
of

1252
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,800
the digitalization of society and the

1253
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,880
importance it leads to cyber security

1254
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
and that in effect is also why my

1255
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,800
organization works in this area

1256
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
we were born as an organization and we

1257
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,079
originally characterize ourselves as a

1258
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,440
digital rights organization as you

1259
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
described it

1260
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
and we now describe ourselves ourselves

1261
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,680
as a human rights organization in the

1262
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,720
digital age

1263
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,400
recognizing that digital touches every

1264
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
part of our societies and qualities

1265
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,599
globally

1266
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,040
and what has happened is that in fact

1267
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,319
these issues that we deal with are no

1268
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,000
longer just digital rights issues

1269
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,200
they're human rights issues and

1270
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,960
therefore cyber security touches upon

1271
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,800
nearly every major element of

1272
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,200
social industrial as well as political

1273
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
policy conversations

1274
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,240
our birth actually is an organization

1275
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,079
and why i often joke and say is that i

1276
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,040
get to build on

1277
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,960
the hard work of many others here is

1278
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,319
that we've actually born of the digital

1279
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,680
security organization

1280
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,599
a service provider in this space trying

1281
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,880
to assist

1282
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,359
uh civil society groups journalists

1283
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,119
activists whistleblowers

1284
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,760
democratic campaigners in their security

1285
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,440
needs as they try to organize

1286
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,200
a recognition that the internet empowers

1287
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,040
and enables people but it's also a

1288
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,000
source of

1289
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
harm source of threat vectors and a

1290
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,760
source of sometimes vulnerability and

1291
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,560
weakness

1292
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,520
to what they may be doing but it shapes

1293
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,480
everything that they do

1294
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
so in fact the real core of the

1295
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,359
organization and the sort of work that i

1296
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,800
do in the public policy team

1297
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,319
actually builds on our digital security

1298
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,880
helpline which is a 24x7 helpline

1299
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,680
maintained

1300
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
by the organization featuring incident

1301
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
handlers security trainers security

1302
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,079
analysts

1303
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,079
whose job it is to help journalists

1304
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,680
activists whistleblowers and others

1305
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,400
globally

1306
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
users at risk and vulnerable communities

1307
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,359
where they belong to lgbtqi communities

1308
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,800
or targeted vulnerable

1309
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
and ethnically targeted communities in

1310
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,839
many parts of the world

1311
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,240
with their digital security needs and

1312
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,680
what we see there is an increase

1313
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,839
significantly in sorts of security needs

1314
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,319
that they

1315
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,000
say and that shapes a little bit of what

1316
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,400
we do in our public policy work

1317
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,720
access now our helpline along with many

1318
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
other organizations in this space some

1319
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,599
of you may know them of course citizen

1320
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:26,000
lab

1321
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,760
but many others as well amnesty tech and

1322
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,200
others help form and

1323
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,680
coordinate the civil society computer

1324
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,920
emergency response team city cert

1325
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,520
and our organization is also now a

1326
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,800
member of the forum for incident

1327
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,079
response first

1328
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,599
and the reason we are there is because

1329
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,680
we see this

1330
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,440
issue about the use of digital

1331
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,720
technologies by

1332
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,760
civil society by civic space as forming

1333
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,119
critical infrastructure for modern

1334
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,000
democracies

1335
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,119
and if you don't protect this

1336
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
infrastructure you're actually not

1337
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,800
protecting a critical part of what we

1338
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
need to safeguard globally

1339
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
our helpline has seen a significant

1340
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,079
increase in the number of requests

1341
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,119
during the pandemic

1342
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,960
and it's shown as also what's happened

1343
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
in terms of digital becoming important

1344
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
and pervasive to what everyone does

1345
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,119
so what people are doing offline or in a

1346
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,240
partially digital way

1347
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,760
is being done in a much more digitally

1348
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,800
connected way over 2020 to 2021.

1349
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,359
by way of example uh just in april and

1350
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,160
march

1351
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,559
we saw 180 requests to our helpline

1352
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,200
followed by then 195 requests

1353
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,960
significant increases month by month in

1354
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,800
fact every month sees our helplines

1355
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,280
receive more requests and more ask there

1356
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,720
and a significant number of the sort of

1357
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,400
requests we receive are reactionary it's

1358
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,960
people

1359
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,559
coming under threat of harm and trying

1360
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,640
to see how they can be helped 73

1361
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,280
of the cases we saw in 2020 were

1362
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,040
reactionary incident response

1363
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,880
requests with most of our requests being

1364
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
to help people with account compromise

1365
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,160
but also significant number of requests

1366
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
from society being around censorship in

1367
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
terms of removed content on social media

1368
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,079
and trying to see how they could address

1369
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,680
this we also saw nearly 180 incidents of

1370
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,040
harassment against human rights

1371
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,760
defenders

1372
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,880
using cyber means in 2020. 26

1373
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,240
of our cases have been prevented which

1374
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,319
is that cyber that civil society and

1375
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,760
democratic communities are starting to

1376
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,240
see

1377
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,559
how can they probably defend themselves

1378
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,839
but it's still a

1379
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,520
tiny portion of what we are seeing and

1380
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,079
rather majority of what we're getting is

1381
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,520
a request to immediately help people

1382
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,160
that need why i also mention this is

1383
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,359
that a lot of things that don't seem

1384
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,000
connected to

1385
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,319
cyber or cyber security play a role in

1386
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,440
this for example

1387
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,480
one of the questions we've gotten

1388
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,920
recently and i thought i'd share here as

1389
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,720
well is

1390
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,480
internet shutdowns have a cyber security

1391
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,400
impact when internet shutdowns have been

1392
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,480
ordered including the continuation of

1393
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,280
shutdowns

1394
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
ordered by some government agencies in

1395
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
parts of the world during the pandemic

1396
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,960
is resulted in security updates not

1397
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,480
being rolled out to devices

1398
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,240
people not being able to access security

1399
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,800
expertise or incident handling resources

1400
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,720
and what that has resulted in many

1401
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
people in the most vulnerable

1402
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,200
tricky and sometimes ethnically tense

1403
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,440
or otherwise disturbed communities or

1404
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,559
regions in the world

1405
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,000
not be able to receive the digital

1406
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
security assistance they need

1407
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
we see an increasing sophistication and

1408
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,680
attacks against the society and an

1409
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,040
overall increase as i noted during the

1410
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,000
pandemic

1411
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,520
and that's one reason why we take part

1412
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
in cyber security policy discussions

1413
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,760
our focus is to ensure an advance an

1414
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,359
approach to cyber security

1415
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,280
policy proposals at the national level

1416
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,720
or international loans

1417
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,520
that are user-centric systemic and

1418
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,599
products of plural inclusive democratic

1419
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,400
processes

1420
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,760
and i think that's why the session topic

1421
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,599
something that really interested me do

1422
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,960
obviously parallel or convergent

1423
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,920
perspectives

1424
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,440
and ironically we're seeing a mix of

1425
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,599
both what we're seeing is a recognition

1426
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,240
for us

1427
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,720
and that internationally protected human

1428
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,319
rights are complementary to cyber

1429
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,480
security they are not opposed to it

1430
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,839
sometimes we see the human rights

1431
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,599
communities and the cyber security or

1432
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,119
national security communities

1433
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,640
see each other in tension and we

1434
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,800
actually believe that is not just a lost

1435
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,359
opportunity that makes for bad policy

1436
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,880
good human rights respecting approaches

1437
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,319
in cyber security improves cyber

1438
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,359
security as a whole

1439
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,760
reducing mistrust helping encourage

1440
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,200
actual communication but also

1441
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,000
recognizing

1442
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,920
as i mentioned that civil society and

1443
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,520
other groups are stakeholders in cyber

1444
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,200
security they are users of it they're

1445
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,160
providers of it

1446
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,960
and they're there for important

1447
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,359
stakeholders in it we also therefore

1448
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,200
unfortunately also need to recognize

1449
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,359
that cyber proposals and cyber security

1450
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,880
policy recommendations

1451
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,200
sometimes also harm wider societal

1452
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,920
interests

1453
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
or don't take them into account where

1454
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,920
the freedom online coalition

1455
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,000
its statement in february 2020 was a

1456
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,760
useful reminder of this where they noted

1457
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,240
that

1458
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,440
cyber security laws cyber crime laws at

1459
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,119
the national level but also global

1460
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,480
and regional discussions around cyber

1461
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,880
policy sometimes pose a threat to human

1462
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,839
rights or are used

1463
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,079
as excuses to attack human rights and

1464
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,920
that is something that states need to

1465
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,839
push back on and i think we've seen a

1466
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,000
lot of that sort of realization over

1467
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,040
large parts of 2020 21 some moderate

1468
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,079
successes

1469
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,000
some promising opportunities for the

1470
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,559
future but a lot of ground to cover

1471
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,000
we have seen as you've seen some

1472
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,680
moderate success in global cyber norms

1473
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,520
conversations including at the u.n

1474
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,040
for example we actually think that the

1475
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,960
un processes are very important

1476
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,640
it's very also important to not depend

1477
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,640
solely on them to have multiple

1478
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,760
diverse and perhaps un plus processes

1479
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
such as for example the cyber security

1480
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,920
tech accord the paris call and trust

1481
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,440
trust and security and cyberspace and

1482
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,240
many others

1483
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,839
but the ui process is also critical

1484
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,839
because it is the one multilateral place

1485
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,119
that all states

1486
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,960
look to or take part in even if they

1487
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,319
don't always agree and

1488
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,559
a backsliding in the un processes is

1489
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:21,680
very very harmful

1490
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
i think all of us saw the disagreements

1491
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,440
in the previous gge

1492
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,839
and the and uh sort of understanding

1493
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,040
that it didn't really achieve its

1494
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,599
outcome

1495
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
as being extremely problematic and

1496
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,680
resulting in greater norm conflict or

1497
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,079
diffusion globally

1498
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,920
that that's why the recognition of this

1499
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,520
oew report and preventing that

1500
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,359
backsliding is very useful even though

1501
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,040
its result was far less ambitious than

1502
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,440
what even we hoped for in particular i

1503
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,640
think that

1504
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,319
there was a couple of lost opportunities

1505
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,240
there we could have seen better

1506
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,400
progress on simple practical technical

1507
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,000
approaches such as for example

1508
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,280
vulnerability disclosure

1509
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,440
to sort of technical mechanisms of

1510
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,359
disclosing how vulnerabilities

1511
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,760
are taking place ways for states or

1512
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,040
other actors to report them

1513
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,559
and having those processes connected to

1514
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,559
a multilateral forum like the uin and

1515
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,520
elsewhere

1516
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,880
we also believe that they can be more

1517
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,240
done on recognizing the role of

1518
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,160
non-state actors in sometimes being

1519
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,880
threat actors to cyber security there

1520
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,160
was recognition of that in some of the

1521
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,520
oewg's earlier

1522
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,000
text versions not carried forward fully

1523
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,599
in the final report also noted in the

1524
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,559
chair statement

1525
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,079
but then there are complementary un

1526
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,680
processes that might be helpful for

1527
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,480
example

1528
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,800
the you the working group on mercenaries

1529
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,520
in the oh

1530
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,920
chr process and looking at the role of

1531
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
cyber mercenaries may be a place to take

1532
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,200
strong positions against

1533
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,440
spy bans surveillance tech vendors who

1534
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,119
are sometimes resulting in a decrease in

1535
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,280
global cyber security

1536
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,359
we also believe that it's important to

1537
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,960
recognize that there will be tension

1538
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,599
between

1539
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,400
states industry and civil society a lot

1540
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,480
of these discussions in the un uwt was

1541
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,240
about civil society participation but

1542
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,920
what really struck me was a comment made

1543
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,119
by a senior official

1544
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,720
involved in the process i respect

1545
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,640
confidentiality and i won't name

1546
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,559
won't name them but what they said was

1547
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,680
to civil society is

1548
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
yes you are trying to get into the room

1549
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,200
but when you're in the room are speaking

1550
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,440
don't hold back your job is to hold us

1551
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,280
to account to hold others to account

1552
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,359
and to speak truth to power that sort of

1553
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,200
commentary is required because while a

1554
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,640
lot of the u.n discussions are about

1555
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,480
diplomacy and states agreeing

1556
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,839
it's also degree to which you need to

1557
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,079
push them even states who agree on

1558
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,000
better coordinated cyber norms are

1559
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,599
conducting practices domestically or

1560
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,599
bilaterally which might be problematic

1561
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,960
the sort of tension we've seen in the

1562
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,040
national security and surveillance and

1563
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,720
vulnerability stockpiling space

1564
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,480
versus say for example effective cyber

1565
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,079
security connections

1566
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
the other thing that struck me taking

1567
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,119
part in these processes and then many

1568
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,880
others noted was the disconnect between

1569
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,680
what's said

1570
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,640
in u.n meetings whether in new york

1571
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,359
geneva

1572
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,440
or in the future in vienna and what

1573
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,119
happens with national capitals or what

1574
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,640
happens in security researchers on the

1575
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,359
ground

1576
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,960
far too often states say they want to

1577
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,920
see more coordination on cyber security

1578
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,760
expertise sharing and norm agreement

1579
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,920
globally but then national cyber crime

1580
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,400
laws

1581
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
still criminalize security research

1582
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,000
still provide gray areas that

1583
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,040
prosecutors

1584
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,319
sometimes out of misguided intentions

1585
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,160
and sometimes unfortunately due to

1586
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,319
desires to suppress uh criticism of

1587
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,400
government practices or on

1588
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,280
uh preventing cyber security disclosures

1589
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,319
criminalize what pros

1590
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,720
what cyber security researchers do and

1591
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,359
therefore we

1592
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,599
undermine the the largest cyber security

1593
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,559
community that we all need to depend on

1594
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,160
the last thing i'd leave is also the

1595
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,079
context of national cyber crime laws and

1596
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,359
i think that's critical as we see the

1597
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,079
un's

1598
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,720
cyber crime treaty process kick off with

1599
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,400
the ad hoc working group there

1600
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
and we've recognized that there is a

1601
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,760
tension there between national

1602
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,880
and international cyber crime

1603
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,040
discussions data disclosures and

1604
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,559
protecting human rights

1605
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,160
and i think that's something we should

1606
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,599
this take into account i'm just

1607
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,200
reflecting on the fact that yesterday we

1608
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,480
saw a ruling from the european court of

1609
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,359
human rights

1610
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,440
touching upon some of these issues and

1611
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,359
as we see the formalization of the

1612
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,799
second optional protocol

1613
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,720
under the budapest convention on cyber

1614
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,799
crime and you see future discussions in

1615
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,319
the u.n cyber crime process

1616
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,079
we need to make sure that we don't go

1617
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,240
into discussions that undermine trust

1618
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,599
that set up conflict

1619
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:06,880
if international cyber crime

1620
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
harmonization proposals

1621
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,319
are at the risk of human rights

1622
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,520
particularly about criminalizing

1623
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,640
legitimate speech

1624
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,960
or harming privacy we are setting them

1625
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,839
up to fail

1626
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,079
we are allowing states to disagree with

1627
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,000
each other to set up geopolitical

1628
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,720
conflict but also set up legal and

1629
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,720
non-conflict at the domestic level

1630
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
and therefore we need to not just

1631
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,680
involve society and other actors there

1632
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,559
but we need to look at these sort of

1633
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,839
complementarities between the human

1634
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,200
rights system in the u.n

1635
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,640
the international peace and security

1636
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,400
discussions and what technical

1637
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,640
communities are seeing on cyber security

1638
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,920
i wanted to therefore chart out these

1639
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,079
sort of complementarities divergent

1640
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,119
processes so i would say

1641
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,720
sometime like a line sometimes running

1642
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,160
parallel sometimes intersecting with

1643
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,720
each other

1644
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,640
sometimes very close to each other but

1645
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,160
recognizing that we're not always there

1646
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:50,799
yet

1647
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,559
and but therefore what i do look forward

1648
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,240
to is discussions in this session

1649
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,920
questioning and challenging this and

1650
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,119
thank you for giving me the opportunity

1651
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,520
to speak

1652
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,599
thank you rahman thanks for this uh

1653
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,040
this overview of your your sort of

1654
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,680
uh the end use of rights and then the

1655
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
human centric approach that you

1656
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,520
also stood for in the in the un open

1657
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
ended working group processes

1658
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,440
uh we have uh rather few minutes left

1659
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,000
i would like to uh ask you one one

1660
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,440
question to uh

1661
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,400
to sort of follow up on your

1662
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,000
presentation and then we we still have

1663
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,559
an

1664
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,359
an outstanding question to vladimir and

1665
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,319
jonas

1666
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,520
so rahman axes now forcefully promoted a

1667
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,079
human-centric approach in global

1668
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:36,960
cybersecurity discussion

1669
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,720
you obviously closely followed the un

1670
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,079
open-ended working group

1671
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,480
process and you stood for highlighting

1672
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,160
the right to privacy and

1673
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,359
data protection and right to information

1674
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,359
and most interesting for for me actually

1675
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,520
for practical technical means for

1676
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,960
accessible for

1677
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,119
for improving cyber security how much do

1678
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,079
you think that

1679
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,040
such venues such as the u.n norms groups

1680
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,920
can push for the culture change

1681
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,240
needed to make cyber security more end

1682
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,119
user accessible

1683
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,280
i think we're seeing slow but positive

1684
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,960
progress the fact that

1685
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,640
a human-centric approach was recognized

1686
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,640
in the oewg's final report

1687
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,640
despite and i would note opposition from

1688
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,839
some states initially

1689
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,079
disagreement skepticism on what it meant

1690
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,760
is a tremendously positive thing

1691
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,599
it allows us to now shape what will come

1692
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,200
next there it's also

1693
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,520
an effective repudiation of the sort of

1694
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,440
idea that cyber security is a purely

1695
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,319
either

1696
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,119
diplomatic norm setting conversation or

1697
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,799
something that is only very technical

1698
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,160
looking at large systems

1699
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,760
and i think what we need to see next in

1700
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,480
the new oewg but also in the vienna

1701
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
processes with the u.n ad hoc group on

1702
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,359
cyber crime

1703
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,799
is a recognition of a human-centric

1704
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,280
approach requires looking at whether

1705
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
norms and principles protect the

1706
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,640
individual users

1707
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,160
involved in these processes and better

1708
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,720
secures them you are you protecting the

1709
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,480
individuals and the humans involved in

1710
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,760
cyber security

1711
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,119
security researchers in the wider

1712
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,880
security research community

1713
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,119
and are you writing an effective remedy

1714
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,799
involvement and accountability in these

1715
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:09,599
processes

1716
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,680
but it's still a challenge but we've

1717
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,440
seen some initial progress and i've been

1718
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,119
accused of being an optimist and i think

1719
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,760
i probably still am in 2021.

1720
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,040
thank you it's an optimistic note to

1721
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,079
to conclude that that presentation on

1722
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,839
vlada and jonas i i will ask for your

1723
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,880
quick comments on the

1724
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,119
on software vulnerabilities

1725
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,799
uh uh what uh

1726
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,000
incentives what uh what ideas what

1727
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,480
mechanisms could there be to uh

1728
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,760
to convince states to not uh stockpile

1729
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,799
and use uh

1730
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,079
zero days do you have any ideas how to

1731
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:52,799
achieve that

1732
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,520
is the is the final question and i

1733
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,559
realize a minute is very short time but

1734
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,040
try yourself i may try to to briefly

1735
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,559
respond

1736
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,960
on one hand how to incentivize even the

1737
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,880
producers which is a big thing

1738
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,559
because the whole industry has shifted

1739
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,319
from companies and raman just reminded

1740
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:10,799
me

1741
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,400
that the digital products are not

1742
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,640
anymore produced by companies only

1743
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,240
it's the civil society organizations

1744
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,160
which are putting up their own software

1745
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,760
it's the governments it's everyone is

1746
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,520
doing that so the whole complexity adds

1747
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,400
to that

1748
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,160
and that adds to the complexity of the

1749
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
effects of a possible attack

1750
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,200
uh or misuse of vulnerabilities and my

1751
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,040
general comment or or regret with it

1752
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,200
with the last open any working group

1753
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,480
fund report uh which was good was that

1754
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,520
this ex exploitation of vulnerabilities

1755
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,119
and this stockpiling

1756
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,559
was not more prominently um

1757
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,040
underlined as a real real threat even if

1758
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,559
not as part of the norms

1759
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,720
don't stockpile but at least within the

1760
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,599
threats part

1761
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,760
this is one of the critical components

1762
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,440
of stability of of

1763
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,839
of cyberspace i'm not sure how to push

1764
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,280
governments for that i'm i'm quite

1765
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,880
skeptical that we can

1766
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
but maybe pushing them towards more

1767
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,400
transparency such as

1768
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,160
vulnerability equity processes that we

1769
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,319
know what type of vulnerabilities they

1770
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,960
stockpile

1771
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,359
when and how they use in what cases and

1772
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,319
and so on maybe

1773
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,240
transparency can at least help a little

1774
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,000
bit i don't know honestly if you have

1775
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,480
other view

1776
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,760
no thank you i think that summarizes it

1777
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,599
really well and also raman's comment

1778
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,599
about the oewg with regard to

1779
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,680
vulnerability disclosure yes that that's

1780
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,000
one

1781
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,119
way of of also showing more

1782
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,680
responsibility of all stakeholders in in

1783
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,480
disclosing

1784
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,119
timely disclosure of vulnerabilities

1785
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,000
yeah but

1786
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,400
i i cannot add really anything

1787
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,240
substantial to what florida said thank

1788
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,599
you

1789
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,240
thank you gentlemen it's been an uh a

1790
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,200
discussion that

1791
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,040
we could easily continue for at least a

1792
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,319
half an hour i'm

1793
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,640
uh i very much appreciate all of your

1794
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,720
your rather practical takes to the

1795
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,440
the subject that is inevitably rather

1796
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,799
abstract

1797
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,200
so uh with that i would like to uh

1798
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,880
thank all of you for your for your

1799
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,559
presentations for sharing your

1800
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,599
your insight and thoughts and thanks the

1801
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,319
audience

1802
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,079
thank you to the audience for for

1803
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,319
listening cycling will continue

1804
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,359
so i hope to see you around thanks very

1805

much again

1806
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:33,790
[Music]

1807
