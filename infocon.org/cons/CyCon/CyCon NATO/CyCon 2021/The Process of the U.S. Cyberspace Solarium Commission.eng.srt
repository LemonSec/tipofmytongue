00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,319
panel by talking about

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,159
how uh the commission was established

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
and what the motivation was behind uh

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
behind its creation and then

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
brandon we'll get into a bit more detail

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
about about the process of the

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
commission itself

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,159
so um uh amy as you mentioned the

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,080
commission was created in the 2019

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
national defense authorization act um

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
it's a congressional commission

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,319
and um it was a bipartisan mission so it

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
had 14 commissioners

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,439
came from both democratic and republican

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,159
parties across members of congress the

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
executive branch and the private sector

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
and um its purpose was to develop a

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
comprehensive strategy and also a set of

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
meaningful and implementable policy

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
recommendations to defend the united

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,120
states against cyber attacks of

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
significant

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
consequence and a big part of the

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,639
motivation behind

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,960
its establishment was this general

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
recognition that

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
the united states lacked a comprehensive

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,080
cyber strategy

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,000
um anchored sort of at the highest level

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
that could drive

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
um implementation across different

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
elements of the government

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
even though there were sort of different

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
strategic documents across different

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
parts of the government there wasn't

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,759
one comprehensive uh perspective um and

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,800
in particular

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
um that sort of the absence of this um

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
cyber strategy at sort of the highest

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,440
level of government meant that um

136
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
you know there wasn't a mechanism for

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
sort of clearly articulating and

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
defining

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
rules and responsibilities and how

140
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
different uh subordinate elements are

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
are supposed to be operating um and so

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
you know to me what really stands out is

143
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
that you know around the time of the

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,479
commission's

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,120
creation there was essentially sort of

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,080
strategic

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
fragmentation or confusion uh

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
within the government at least from my

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,639
perspective so you know i think a few

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,520
examples kind of illustrate this point

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
on the one hand

152
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
you had the 2018 national cyber strategy

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
which articulated this idea of

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
preserving peace through strength and

155
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
then also

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
called out the state department cyber

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
deterrence initiative

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
uh which was focused on figuring out how

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
to impose different types of

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
consequences

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
for actions that were seen as violating

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
different norms of behavior

163
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
um at the same time though around the

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
same time

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
the u.s cyber command released its 2018

166
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
command vision

167
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
um which came out before the department

168
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
of defense debuted its updated cyber

169
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
strategy so the 2018 strategy which was

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,319
an update of its 2015 strategy

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,560
and the cyber command command vision

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
seemed to sort of reject the idea of

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
cyber deterrence entirely

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
even though the national cyber strategy

175
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,199
was explicitly grounded in

176
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
a logic of deterrence and instead the

177
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,639
command vision

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
advocated this concept of cyber

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,080
persistence

180
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
which became sort of formulated into

181
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
this idea of persistent engagement

182
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
um shortly after that the department of

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,919
defense

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,720
introduced its 2018 cyber strategy which

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,639
contained this concept of defense

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,600
forward

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,080
um and according to the summary that was

188
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
released of that strategy

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
the idea behind defend forward was that

190
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,319
u.s cyber forces should be

191
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,440
rather than be in sort of a reactive

192
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
posture should be operating you know as

193
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
close to the adversary as possible

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
to learn about their evolving

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
capabilities and their ttps

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
and when appropriate and authorized take

197
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,599
action to disrupt deny

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
or degrade their offensive capabilities

199
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
and the infrastructure that's used to

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
enable them and at the time it wasn't

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,160
entirely clear

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
to external observers at least how

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
these concepts of defense forward and

204
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
persistent engagement were meant to

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
relate to one another because both

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
contain sort of similar logics and

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
ideas um or so more importantly

208
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
how they related to the broader national

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
strategy which was anchored in the idea

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
of deterrence um so there seemed to be

211
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,479
this sort of inherent

212
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,960
tension perhaps confusion or lack of a

213
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
cohesive strategic mission

214
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
so um so so that was sort of an

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
important

216
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
gap that the cyberspace delirium

217
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
commission

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
was aiming to fill at at the strategic

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,000
level

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and what the commission set out to do

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
was to reconcile these different

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
approaches

223
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
and in doing so articulate a national

224
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
strategy that could bring more

225
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
um cohesion and unity unity to how how

226
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,840
the us government was thinking about and

227
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,879
implementing

228
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
on cyber strategy and policy but i also

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,080
think

230
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
it's important to point out and i

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
imagine that mark will talk about this

232
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
in a bit more detail that the commission

233
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
wasn't only about the strategy itself it

234
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
was also very much focused on

235
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
implementation so i don't remember which

236
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
commissioner it was who said it but

237
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,479
one of our commissioners like to say

238
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
that there was we had a bias for action

239
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,800
so

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,479
the strategy is the foundation of the

241
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
commission's report

242
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
um but equally if not more important are

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,320
also the policy actions especially the

244
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
legislative provisions that the

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
commission was able to

246
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
um help um get into the

247
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
2021 national defense authorization um

248
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,120
and so

249
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
that's where the structure of the

250
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
commission became so important for us

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
because we had

252
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
four active members of congress across

253
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
both parties and across the house and

254
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,399
the senate which is

255
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,920
somewhat unusual for a congressional

256
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
commission and was really instrumental

257
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
in our legislative success

258
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
um but to go back to the sort of the

259
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
commission's um approach

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
and it's the purpose for its um for its

261
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
establishment

262
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
um so it was really meant to fill the

263
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
sort of gap in existing cyber strategy

264
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
and the commission drew its name and

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
it's sort of inspiration

266
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,160
from president eisenhower's project

267
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
scenario

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
which uh took place in the early days of

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
the cold war

270
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
um and and and reflected as a process

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
that president eisenhower established to

272
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
develop a strategy for addressing the

273
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
emerging soviet threat

274
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
um so under eisenhower's project

275
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
solarium um there were sort of three

276
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,200
different

277
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
task forces each focus on a different

278
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
lens toward uh toward grand strategy

279
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
with respect to the soviet union

280
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
one sort of became kind of the

281
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
containment task force

282
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,920
um another focus on nuclear deterrence

283
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
and then

284
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
the third focus on more of a hardline

285
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,240
approach which

286
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
we now may associate with the idea of

287
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,000
rollback um

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
and so you know the idea behind drawing

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
this inspiration from the early days of

290
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
the cold war is that even though

291
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
we're in the contemporary environment

292
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
has many different

293
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
characteristics from the nature of the

294
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
cold war challenge

295
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
it represents sincerely systemic and uh

296
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
and urgent challenges um so of course

297
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
there are a number of

298
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
differences um now in cyberspace we face

299
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
a multitude of threat actors

300
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,360
at different levels of capability um and

301
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
with different strategic motivations

302
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
the strategic environment is not one

303
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
that's characterized by

304
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
the threat of cataclysmic violence that

305
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,800
would come from

306
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
the use of nuclear weapons but rather

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,399
more sort of routine

308
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,279
malicious corrosive behavior that takes

309
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,000
place

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
most of the time below a use of force

311
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,519
threshold

312
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
and then another big difference is the

313
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
role of the private sector both as a

314
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,279
target

315
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
of malicious attacks as well as um the

316
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,880
owner

317
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
operator of most of the infrastructure

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
that private actors and the government

319
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
rely on

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,839
for all different types of things um so

321
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
um on the one hand the strategic

322
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,399
environment is is

323
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,760
sort of quite different but on the other

324
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
hand it's a similarly

325
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
um sort of systemic challenge and so the

326
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,079
commission organized itself

327
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
um drawing from eisenhower's uh

328
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
organization

329
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
and his process for uh for project

330
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
solarium so we were organized into three

331
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,120
different task forces

332
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
which brandon will talk about um in more

333
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
detail in a few minutes

334
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
um but essentially the task forces were

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
meant to represent

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
the primary strands of thinking in

337
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,480
different circles about u.s cyber

338
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,040
strategy

339
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
so um task force one was focused on

340
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,399
you know active disruption defend

341
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,399
forward persistent engagement

342
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
task force two was focused on uh denial

343
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,839
and resilience and defense and task

344
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,680
force three focused on engagement and

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
norms and then there was a fourth

346
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
directive directorate that explored

347
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
cross-cutting issues um and so

348
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
again brandon will get into the process

349
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
a bit more in a few minutes but i won't

350
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
i won't get into the details here uh but

351
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
essentially after an extensive process

352
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
of research and outreach by the

353
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
different task forces

354
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
each task force produced a unique report

355
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
uh the reports were subjected to red

356
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
team analysis by external experts and

357
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
further refined

358
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
there was a comprehensive exercise that

359
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,639
was organized around different scenarios

360
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
and then long story short would emerge

361
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,079
from this process

362
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
was a strategy of layered cyber

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
deterrence and

364
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
this is the anchoring strategy for the

365
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,959
commission's report

366
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,560
and um and is what drives the 80 plus

367
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
policy recommendations that that are

368
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
found in it so i'll close my my remarks

369
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,200
by talking

370
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
briefly about the logic of layered cyber

371
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
deterrence and

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
i'm happy to talk more about that

373
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
concept um in greater detail in q a

374
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
um so essentially layered cyber

375
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
deterrence i would say is anchored in a

376
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:52,959
few

377
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,240
core assumptions the first is that

378
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
deterrence is actually possible in

379
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,959
cyberspace

380
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
so you had this sort of prior debate in

381
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
u.s policy and strategy circles about

382
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,680
whether or not deterrence works and it's

383
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
possible and it's feasible or worthwhile

384
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
and the commission very much

385
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
came down on the side of deterrence

386
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,600
however

387
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
um you know it was clear that we need to

388
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,959
have a more

389
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
nuanced understanding of how deterrence

390
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,079
might operate

391
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
differently at different thresholds and

392
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
so it doesn't make sense to take a

393
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,800
binary

394
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
sort of all-or-nothing approach to

395
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
whether cyber deterrence works but

396
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,279
rather

397
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,480
identify the conditions under which

398
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
it might work and the conditions under

399
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
which we need different types of tools

400
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
uh paired to different types of

401
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
deterrence challenges and so

402
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,680
you know above the use of force

403
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
threshold or the level of armed attack

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,199
we've sort of already seen

405
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,720
cyber deterrence and um that's

406
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
largely probably due to the credible

407
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
threat of retaliation

408
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,800
sort of across the spectrum using um

409
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
using cyber non-cyber

410
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
instruments um the challenge is really

411
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,760
below that threshold

412
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
um and so the commission you know

413
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
has essentially argued that we need to

414
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,480
sort of

415
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
rethink how we define deterrence sort of

416
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,639
below that threshold

417
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,480
and sort of question whether it makes

418
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
sense to define successful deterrence

419
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,680
outcomes as being

420
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,079
a complete absence of malicious activity

421
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,680
which was the metric for nuclear

422
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
deterrence for obvious reasons

423
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
um but rather focus on a reduction in

424
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
their magnitude and their frequency

425
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
um so that's sort of the first core

426
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
assumption of layered cyber deterrence

427
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,800
um the second is that the best form of

428
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,839
fighter deterrence

429
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
is deterrence by denial um so you kind

430
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
of have these three different

431
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
visions of deterrence or mechanisms of

432
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
deterrence returns by punishment

433
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,240
deterrence by denial and deterrence by

434
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,839
um uh by uh entanglement

435
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,199
um and you know while layered cyber

436
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
deterrents contain sort of

437
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
all of these mechanisms of deterrence so

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
the bulk of the strategy is oriented

439
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,199
around the logic of denial

440
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
which which means sort of improving your

441
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
own defenses and resilience and making

442
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
it harder for for adversaries to protect

443
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
 behavior um the third

444
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
core assumption is that the private

445
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
sector has to be systematically

446
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
incorporated into national security

447
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
strategy as a key stakeholder

448
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
um and it seems sort of obvious to say

449
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,480
in a cyber context

450
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
but um it's an important innovation i

451
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
think in thinking about national

452
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
security strategy more broadly because

453
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,079
that's just

454
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,880
simply not um not the typical

455
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,079
orientation

456
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,120
um and then finally um you know all

457
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
instruments of national

458
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,759
power are are sort of important not just

459
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,959
um cyber tools um and so that those are

460
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,399
sort of the core assumptions of layered

461
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,519
cyber deterrence

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
um and the vision really is these sort

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
of three different

464
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
um layers um that operate in different

465
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,279
proportions

466
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
at a different threshold so at the

467
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
highest threshold um

468
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
the focus is more on cost and position

469
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
mostly through the use of military

470
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,839
instruments

471
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,000
um below that threshold the focus is

472
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
really on

473
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
denial and resilience um and then sort

474
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,800
of at the far

475
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,680
left of the spectrum most of the focus

476
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,240
is on

477
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
norm's development and shaping behavior

478
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,880
through diplomatic means and engagement

479
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,000
um and and um the way that the

480
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
commission aim to sort of reconcile

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
defend forward and layered cyber

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,279
deterrence

483
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
um is that just defend forward is

484
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,399
something that operates

485
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,240
across um across the across that

486
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,199
spectrum

487
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,880
um and is focused on

488
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
maneuvering in cyberspace to um to

489
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,560
collect

490
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,440
information about adversary behavior and

491
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
intent and capabilities

492
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
and to share that with sort of domestic

493
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,800
stakeholders in the sort of denial and

494
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
resilience

495
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
uh bucket of the spectrum to enable

496
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,959
defense

497
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,920
and sort of in in a limited way support

498
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
the uh the cost and position aspect of

499
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,800
the strategy

500
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
um so that's sort of the um intent

501
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
behind the commission's founding and

502
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
where the commission ended up in terms

503
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
of a strategic perspective

504
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,599
and happy to talk about any more of this

505
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
in q a but i'll turn

506
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,839
turn the mic over to uh to brandon uh to

507
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,160
talk

508
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
more about the process itself

509
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
perfect thank you erica for sending out

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,359
such a brilliant uh

511
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,079
context assumptions and key concepts

512
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
when we're talking about the

513
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
commission brandon over to you and i

514
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,919
believe you have slides as well so we'll

515
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,480
bring those up

516
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,280
great thank you yeah i'm delighted to be

517
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,679
here

518
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,880
um always a big fan of cycon and i miss

519
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,480
being there in person but hopefully

520
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
we'll be able to do it uh in person next

521
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
year

522
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
um i'm gonna build a little bit on what

523
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,400
erica was saying

524
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
and um basically i'm going to skip my

525
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
first two slides

526
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,600
but i think to introduce the paper

527
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,400
that's in the conference proceedings is

528
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
meant to be

529
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,000
paired with the solarium report and

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
the two things together are a lasting

531
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,799
document of our work

532
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,679
a lasting document of the process of the

533
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,960
commission

534
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
and i think that's the key thing we

535
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
wanted to get across with this article

536
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
is the details of strategy

537
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,880
development we tend to not talk about

538
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,240
the nuts and bolts of constructing a

539
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,200
strategy

540
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
and i think one of the big problems is

541
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,760
knowledge of how to construct a strategy

542
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
especially in a highly politically

543
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,840
charged

544
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,120
era is knowledge held by a few people

545
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,760
and the idea behind this paper is to

546
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
democratize that to

547
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
be very open about our process and how

548
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
we came about our conclusions and more

549
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
importantly in this report in this paper

550
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
to talk about risk management so let me

551
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,679
skip to two slides

552
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,720
um and that will leave us on um the

553
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
process slide

554
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
and uh you know as erica mentioned we

555
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,760
had three different task force but

556
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,160
before we get there the goal is that um

557
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
absence of a process to evaluate ideas

558
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
and test assumptions

559
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
strategy formation often devolves into

560
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,960
a competing process of bureaucratic

561
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,440
interest

562
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
and that's what we wanted to avoid and

563
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,799
we are very

564
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,799
happy to have avoided that in the

565
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,720
celerium commission in that

566
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,840
um you know the the the

567
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,679
graham allison perspective of where you

568
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,880
sit

569
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
did it really determine what the

570
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
commission was doing it certainly

571
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
determined what people were saying when

572
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,799
they gave us advice

573
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,160
and when we consulted them but basically

574
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,440
everyone kind of came in

575
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
as equals once we entered the door but

576
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
the goal was to avoid the garbage can of

577
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
ideas which

578
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,080
is a literal um citation in this field

579
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
and it often happens when these

580
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
commissions these reports

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
these evaluation processes just put

582
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,440
everything into the bucket and kind of

583
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,960
hope it all works out

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
and uh that obviously doesn't work um

585
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
very well

586
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,559
we try to establish a clear deliberative

587
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
process to guard against agenda setting

588
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
as well as to check some common sources

589
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
of bias and that was the key thing for

590
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,240
us

591
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
so of course the first thing was to

592
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
build out the executive director who was

593
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,559
mark montgomery

594
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,120
and the chief of staff who was deb

595
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
colonel deb graves i believe

596
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
um and then uh we went to the task force

597
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,400
leads

598
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
which of course erica bogart was another

599
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
one val colfield from the fbi

600
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
led task force two three and john

601
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
costello led a

602
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
task force two uh we also had the senior

603
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,000
research director

604
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,880
who was bet jensen my co-author who was

605
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
currently uh deployed to combat right

606
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
now so he can't be there with us

607
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
and then of course we filled out the

608
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,919
rest of the staff with think tanks

609
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
capitol hill staff academia basically

610
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,240
everyone

611
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,640
who potentially could leverage their

612
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
knowledge and abilities to support the

613
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,159
commission

614
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,840
we had a very truncated and short

615
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
timeline

616
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
i forget exactly how long it was but it

617
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
was basically within a year

618
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
we went from briefings to writing the

619
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
report

620
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,520
to coalescing around the report to the

621
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,640
war game

622
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
to the final actual report and then we

623
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
actually dropped the report on march

624
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,000
2020 which of course became a momentous

625
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,400
month

626
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,159
in international history for many other

627
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
reasons besides the commission report

628
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,919
but we did our best to

629
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,960
promote and to push out the report as

630
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
best possible

631
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,039
um the strategy formation process it was

632
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
not a carbon copy of the eisenhower

633
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,320
solarium process

634
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,240
we were a bit more open and a bit more

635
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
deliberative in terms of how we went

636
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
about doing things

637
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
and the goal of course was to build

638
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
towards commission approval

639
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
we were focused on research questions

640
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
and we had a very extensive research

641
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,159
phase

642
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
with over 300 interviews 300 submissions

643
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
from academia think tanks and multiple

644
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
trips

645
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
to israel to silicon valley to new york

646
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
uh to europe uh we had a team go visit

647
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,280
cyclone and cc

648
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,960
doe um and in the end the task force

649
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,799
strategy was focused on

650
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,280
taking us from individual task force

651
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,480
reports

652
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,520
to a red team

653
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,400
to a report and then the solarium

654
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
commission

655
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
report

656
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
the event we

657
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
kind of focus on this event and i i'm

658
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
kind of surprised i don't remember the

659
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
date of the event at this point maybe

660
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,039
someone else could help me out

661
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,840
with that later but um that was the the

662
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,240
goal

663
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
that was the end state for a lot of us

664
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,760
and the actual

665
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,200
event where we developed and presented

666
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,240
our ideas

667
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
as a team combined elements of red

668
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
teaming matrix work gaming and stress

669
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
tests to allow the commencers to

670
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
evaluate

671
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,000
each task force and each recommendation

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,919
we had two scenarios slow

673
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,640
burn and break glass slow burn was a

674
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
series of small minor cuts that would

675
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
lead to something important and

676
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
devastating in cyber security

677
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
and break glass was a break class and

678
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,559
emergency massive cyber event

679
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,159
in some ways that actually mimicked the

680
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,919
solar winds event that happened a few

681
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,320
months

682
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,039
later observations

683
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,640
the goal and the victory condition as

684
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
erica mentioned is to ensure

685
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,320
connectivity required a modern society

686
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
remains stable despite

687
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
cyber operations so the goal was to

688
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
reduce severity attacks below the

689
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
threshold alarm conflict we were never

690
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
going to deter

691
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
all cyber attacks that's off the table

692
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,520
basically

693
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,039
and in many ways the concept of

694
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,280
deterrence has no

695
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
um it doesn't have very many uh

696
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
intellectual correlation with the cold

697
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
war concept of deterrence it's something

698
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
a little bit different

699
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,559
and of course shaping the international

700
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,400
environment and entanglement in norms

701
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,480
became a very important core concept for

702
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
our strategy

703
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
and then of course we have denial

704
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,679
defensive beam and defense and depth

705
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,039
which was critical

706
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,559
to enabling resiliency and

707
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,840
survival of basic attacks and then also

708
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
we had to enable the field

709
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
and that was about restoring cost and

710
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
position to our national strategy

711
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
which was technically removed under

712
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
persistent engagement

713
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
uh we also spoke quite a bit and we'll

714
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
be developing more work in the future on

715
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:23,919
the critical

716
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,320
importance of signaling division of

717
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
clarity of the strategy because if we

718
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
don't know what the strategy means in

719
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,039
the united states

720
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,200
how are our allies and our adversaries

721
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
supposed to understand the strategy so

722
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,679
that was very much critical for us

723
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,000
the legislative strategy um was very

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,919
important in terms of implementation and

725
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,480
i think

726
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
every other working group every other

727
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
commission they don't exactly think

728
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,240
about

729
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
implementation and this is what was

730
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
critical and this is what allowed us to

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,799
be

732
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
successful in any sort of metric sense

733
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,640
we had 52 legislative

734
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
proposals that was cut down from over

735
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,279
150 during the solarium

736
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,200
matrix war game uh and 27 of them were

737
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
implemented in the 2021

738
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
ndaa the national defense authorization

739
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
act where we fund

740
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,320
the military budget

741
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,799
failures were basically due to either

742
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,000
running out of time

743
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
because we had a short eight month

744
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
process or competing bureaucratic

745
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,320
interests

746
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
and we're working to enable the

747
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,760
remaining

748
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
uh 25 or so recommendations in the 2022

749
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
ndaa

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
and once that's done i'm sure mark will

751
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,960
talk about this but i think at that

752
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
point the commission's work will kind of

753
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
roll up

754
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,279
we were very much critical um critically

755
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,559
focused on

756
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,120
enabling the dod to achieve its goals

757
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
and that's become recent news where

758
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
there's going to be more budget

759
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
allocated to the dod

760
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,120
to expand the cyber mission forces but

761
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
more importantly we needed to enable

762
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
cisa

763
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
the cyber security infrastructure

764
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,919
organization that's part of the dhs to

765
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,159
conduct defensive operations

766
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,640
the dod based on their authorities is

767
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,440
basically

768
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
focused on offensive and forward-moving

769
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,880
uh

770
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
operations to disrupt adversaries well

771
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,400
the dod

772
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,039
i'm sorry the dhs and sisa is focused on

773
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
defensive operations

774
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,720
um we also recommend the state

775
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
department build out their efforts

776
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
and um there is going to be a cyber

777
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,919
diplomacy act that will probably make

778
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,679
its way through congress

779
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,120
over the next few months or even days um

780
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
and finally the most importantly was the

781
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
national cyber director position which

782
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,919
was uh

783
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
just nominated a few months ago for

784
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,760
chris english and the idea was to

785
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
restore an elevated commissioner for all

786
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,200
government efforts to establish a whole

787
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,480
nation strategy

788
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
that we needed to have something outside

789
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
of the dod and nsc

790
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
to enable freedom of action and to

791
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,279
deconflict

792
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,480
between the various branches pressure

793
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
points and risk management is very much

794
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,520
critical

795
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
um one of course we wanted to move

796
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
beyond the basic idea of deterrence

797
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
and um the focus is on the reduction of

798
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,679
attacks not

799
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,960
the stopping all attacks

800
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
we also needed to establish a causal

801
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
mechanism to achieve desired ends

802
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
and that's cost of position denial and

803
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
entanglement strategy so we had three

804
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,039
causal mechanisms basically

805
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
we were also very much uh concerned

806
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,360
about the dangers of escalation risk and

807
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,720
me and erica are you know have done a

808
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
lot of work on escalation escalation

809
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,120
risks

810
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,799
and this is very important for us to

811
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,039
avoid the interactive process that comes

812
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,679
with

813
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,640
a conflict spirals and security dilemmas

814
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
and this can be done through denial

815
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
efforts and communication efforts uh

816
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
particularly signaling efforts

817
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
um we're working now hard uh

818
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
very hard in the u.s system to enable

819
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,480
breach

820
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,799
data reporting and that's gonna be

821
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,640
important because we need to understand

822
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
baselines in the scope of cyber security

823
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,200
activity

824
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
we can't know if our strategy is

825
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
effective unless we measure the

826
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,480
effectiveness of the strategy

827
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,240
and we also through the nda last year uh

828
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
subsection 1744 established a national

829
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
cyber exercise a

830
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,240
a war game of sorts to check progress

831
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,320
and that's important for mitigating risk

832
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
path forward to wrap up the commission

833
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
establish a roadmap for national

834
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
strategic development

835
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,919
that um can be a model for others other

836
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,600
states to develop a strategy in cyber

837
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,320
security

838
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,360
and for other levers of a government

839
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,039
power to develop strategies

840
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
but for us research evidence and data

841
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
were very much critical

842
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
not speculation not bringing up the

843
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,600
tropes and you know

844
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
we're not going to recommend a cyber

845
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,679
letter or mark or something like that

846
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,600
these these spectacular things

847
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
that don't exactly do anything we're

848
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,120
focused on evidence

849
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,039
and the other focus was to avoid whole

850
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,799
of nation strategies

851
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,320
i mean to focus on whole nation

852
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,919
strategies and avoid

853
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,520
whole of department strategies because

854
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,679
we needed to build out more for the us

855
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,399
government

856
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,520
besides just enabling the dod the

857
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,279
process model of strategic reform

858
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,600
avoids bipartisanship and many of the

859
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,559
pathologies

860
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,240
of the past and we're very proud of our

861
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
efforts because

862
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
during a heightened political time

863
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
the commission very much seemed devoid

864
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
of partisanship

865
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,320
and that gave me confidence as an

866
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
american that we can move forward in

867
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,080
this country and avoid some of these

868
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,360
disputes and partisan bickering um

869
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,799
and but in many ways implementation and

870
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,399
creating conditions for success for the

871
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,279
most important

872
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,840
attribute for success uh maybe the

873
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
strategy will live on maybe the strategy

874
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
will become an efficient part of us

875
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,600
government doctrine

876
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
but the most important and lasting thing

877
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
will be the legislative success and the

878
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,159
things that we enable

879
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,159
technically through the mda and that's

880
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,200
important and that's something that

881
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
people need to remember

882
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
when they develop strategies because you

883
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,399
can say something

884
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
but how you actually behave and how you

885
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,679
actually enable

886
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
a strategy is more important than what

887
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
you write down on paper

888
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,200
and with that uh i'll turn it back over

889
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
to amy

890
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,559
thank you brandon for taking us through

891
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,159
that journey and in light of your

892
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,279
comments about

893
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,120
transparency and the importance for that

894
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,480
it's brilliant to see

895
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
this journey and and your paper in this

896
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,480
year's proceedings

897
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,200
um perfect so on to mark

898
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,120
well thank you very much and and thanks

899
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,000
to uh ccdcoe for sponsoring this and uh

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,399
we

901
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,039
we certainly i want to re-emphasize that

902
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,880
they were very helpful to us

903
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
during our investigative phase uh in in

904
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,320
uh

905
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,520
late 2019 when we had a number of our

906
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,039
staffers visit there and then followed

907
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,279
up with uh with interviews afterwards

908
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,080
um so i i'll try not to be repetitive on

909
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,799
my uh

910
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
my two colleagues so as i go through

911
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,000
this what i would say is

912
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
i would step back from one moment into

913
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,520
what erica was talking about and say

914
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
that if if i looked at layered so if i

915
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,880
thought there were three things about

916
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,640
layered cyber deterrence our strategic

917
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,080
recommendation

918
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
um and to recall we were required to

919
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,519
both

920
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
make a strategic recommendation for how

921
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
to better defend our national critical

922
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,240
infrastructure

923
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,919
from significant cyber attack and the

924
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
legislative proposal so

925
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,320
what both um erica and brandon have now

926
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,960
talked about

927
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,039
but i would highlight three areas where

928
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,240
we said look

929
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
in addition to kind of your typical

930
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
joseph nye description of

931
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,600
of um uh deterrence layer side returns

932
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,159
requires

933
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,120
three specific investments first you

934
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,559
absolutely have to invest in your

935
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,519
defense

936
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,440
um as erica mentioned you know this is

937
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,279
something we did we don't have to do

938
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,200
you know traditionally in cruise missile

939
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
defense or

940
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
jet fighter defense in the united states

941
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,840
or anti-submarine warfare

942
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
you know we have the luxury of 4 000

943
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,120
miles at atlantic

944
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,159
7 000 miles of the pacific stable

945
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,720
allies in canada and mexico you know we

946
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,519
really had

947
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,679
a single advantage going back either 70

948
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,880
years if you want to go all the way back

949
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,159
to 1815

950
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,679
you know over 200 years but you know

951
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,200
cyber in a moment removed that

952
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,440
geographic advantage so we really do

953
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,039
have to invest in your defense

954
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,480
and and that was something we weren't

955
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,159
doing the second

956
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,399
critical element is that defense is

957
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,159
owned and the system you're defending is

958
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,600
owned and operated by the private sector

959
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,799
not by the government whereas the

960
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,799
government owns every plane

961
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,919
tank submarine aircraft carrier we don't

962
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,279
own the public infrastructure

963
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,200
and and if we do it's at the state and

964
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
local level

965
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,039
so we really do have to build a better

966
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,799
public private collaboration so that was

967
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,679
step two

968
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
and then step three was we needed to

969
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,320
continue you know we had to instantiate

970
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,799
the idea of defend forward and make sure

971
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,000
that we looked at it

972
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
and with all its attributes not just the

973
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600
military ones

974
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,559
but the economic you know sanctions the

975
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,080
law enforcement indictments and the

976
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,600
diplomatic activity

977
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
and bring it together so we definitely

978
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
understood it was a mix of offensive and

979
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,120
defensive solutions

980
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,840
um i do think in 2020 you know brandon

981
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,440
said we passed 20 25 of our

982
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,240
recommendations

983
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,120
came out in 27 different uh legislative

984
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,760
provisions in other words 27 small laws

985
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,279
which is quite a bit um and but we were

986
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
limited in the areas we were successful

987
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,039
we were very successful i think

988
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,000
in reorganizing the government so that's

989
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
creating the national cyber director you

990
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
know uh

991
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,559
a uh certainly a signpost we took from a

992
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
number of our allies and partners

993
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,519
that have a principal senior person in

994
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,159
the proximity of the national leader who

995
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,480
is uniquely responsible for cyber

996
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,760
so we created the national cyber

997
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,399
director we strengthened sizza and

998
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,640
there's a real argument there do you

999
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
sizzo was not working

1000
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,000
in a number of infrastructure areas that

1001
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,960
it was not

1002
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,200
achieving its appropriate effect a part

1003
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
of that it was it's only a

1004
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
three-year-old organization

1005
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,519
part of it is it's significantly

1006
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,919
under-resourced and part of it is it

1007
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,240
it had to make a choice on what to focus

1008
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,559
on and naturally some things didn't get

1009
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,760
focused but

1010
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,600
we doubled down on cisa the cyber

1011
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,519
security infrastructure security agency

1012
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,440
and really made investments in it and

1013
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,880
legislative gave it

1014
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,519
new powers uh to do its job and then

1015
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,600
finally we had to strengthen those

1016
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,960
parts of the government that are

1017
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
responsible for critical infrastructure

1018
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
so the department of energy with energy

1019
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
the environmental protection agency with

1020
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
water and there's a very

1021
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
uneven level of support across those

1022
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,159
agencies

1023
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
for their infrastructures and so we

1024
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,520
created laws that

1025
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,000
we created a law that said ex explicitly

1026
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,679
this is your sector risk

1027
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,800
management uh responsibilities and you

1028
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,399
will be held accountable for this and

1029
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,079
and hopefully we'll resource you to do

1030
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,320
this mission but we have a very

1031
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,918
inconsistent uh infrastructure landscape

1032
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,040
for example financial services um

1033
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,839
especially the high end the large banks

1034
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,480
is

1035
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,560
you know reasonably secure they have

1036
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,520
some a

1037
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
there are several banks that spend more

1038
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,040
than every federal agency

1039
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
except the department of defense on

1040
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,320
cyber security they spend

1041
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
more than 500 million dollars a year

1042
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,000
they have operation centers that would

1043
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,240
make a three or four star general blush

1044
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,280
but that doesn't mean everything's

1045
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
running properly at those banks but it

1046
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,480
does mean there's a level of investment

1047
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
and commitment

1048
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
but then you go down down we identified

1049
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,560
pipeline security which unfortunately

1050
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,119
um you know uh darkseid doubled down on

1051
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,880
our identification of that recently at

1052
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
colonial we identified water

1053
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,440
and we identified a few others um why

1054
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,400
this is important is

1055
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
that we have to invest in all of these

1056
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,839
areas now look

1057
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,760
we were marge we were successful in

1058
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,000
those areas we were unable

1059
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
to pass the legislation necessary for

1060
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,079
building a public-private partnership

1061
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
and our and our ability to put money

1062
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
into budgets was also

1063
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
uh substandard we only got about 40

1064
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,280
percent of our

1065
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
appropriation recommendations that is

1066
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
plus plusing up investments in specific

1067
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,040
agencies to do their job

1068
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,880
we're only about 40 successful we would

1069
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,320
have liked to have been higher

1070
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,400
now things changed dramatically solar

1071
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,440
winds

1072
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
hafnium colonial i mean these have all

1073
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,400
come together so there was a

1074
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,160
you know a 1.7 billion flowed into the

1075
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,760
cyber security coffers

1076
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,160
you know through uh through the last

1077
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,359
covid bill

1078
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,440
um and this is a cyber security budget

1079
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,640
for the federal government that's about

1080
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,880
18 billion a year so that was a

1081
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
that was a good healthy 10 plus up uh

1082
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
and when you consider none of it was the

1083
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,119
department of defense was about 50

1084
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,560
budget it was really about a 20

1085
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,440
plus up for the gov or the civilian side

1086
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
of our government

1087
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,480
um but as we look into 2021 uh you know

1088
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
we we really have to get a good

1089
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,640
understanding of of how we build that

1090
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,160
public private collaboration we have to

1091
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,520
have more success and again

1092
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,760
i think colonial has really helped us

1093
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,720
one of the things that came out of

1094
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
colonial was just a complete

1095
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
failure to provide security standards to

1096
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,520
them a complete failure to assess

1097
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,960
or inspect colonial uh by its um

1098
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
infrastructure support agency which is

1099
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,480
the transportation security

1100
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,079
people who kind of monitor your travel

1101
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,280
in and out of the united states also

1102
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,760
have

1103
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,520
pipeline security don't ask me how we

1104
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
got to that point

1105
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
although i was involved in it 23 years

1106
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,920
ago and i'm embarrassed that we're

1107
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
at this point um that the second

1108
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,720
issue um is that uh you know is that

1109
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
there was very little incident reporting

1110
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
and and you know and uh you know they

1111
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,720
did not feel the company did not feel

1112
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,839
compelled to

1113
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,599
traffic much with the with the us

1114
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,440
government so

1115
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,240
uh those three incidents solar winds

1116
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,079
have him and then particularly colonial

1117
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,240
pipeline have given us some impetus

1118
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,480
so i think you will see big changes in

1119
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
our public private collaboration

1120
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
and i think the most important one is

1121
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,760
systemically important critical

1122
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,079
infrastructure this is the idea

1123
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,640
that uh you can identify and then

1124
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,480
attempt to protect and defend

1125
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,839
the most critical companies in

1126
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,359
in your country that have targeted and

1127
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,920
exploited by an adversary

1128
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,320
say russia or china it could produce

1129
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,079
really catastrophic consequences for

1130
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,520
your economy

1131
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,160
um your national security or your public

1132
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
health and safety

1133
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,520
so with that said you know i think this

1134
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,160
isn't ted's dry cleaner down the street

1135
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,119
this is florida power or or southern

1136
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,000
company that provides

1137
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,680
most of the power to the southeast

1138
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,839
united states um and what we'd have to

1139
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
do is identify what those critical

1140
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,800
functions are

1141
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
the several hundred companies that own

1142
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,320
and operate our most important critical

1143
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,599
infrastructure

1144
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,800
and then we're gonna have to make a

1145
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,040
compact with those companies

1146
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
and that compact says look we're going

1147
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,280
to burden you with requirements

1148
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,520
and we're going to provide you benefits

1149
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
and then but together what this does is

1150
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,119
it's going to raise the overall level of

1151
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,560
our cyber security and make us more

1152
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,200
effective

1153
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,640
not that we can prevent everything

1154
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,320
that's not going to happen but this has

1155
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
as much to do with

1156
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,800
responding to an incident and recovering

1157
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,240
from an incident

1158
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,839
in a in a more graceful manner so

1159
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,760
uh you know what this require is after

1160
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
we designate these companies

1161
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,040
um they'll have to comply with cyber

1162
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
security performance standards

1163
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
based on identified risk to that

1164
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320
specific type of business operation

1165
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,079
so this will be done very like for banks

1166
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,520
that would be really led

1167
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,839
by their normal regulator or for energy

1168
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,200
it would be for energy production

1169
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
facilities would be led by the um

1170
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
the ferc and the um you know the

1171
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,680
department of energy's uh

1172
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,880
uh regulatory arms um and and then what

1173
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,079
would happen was

1174
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,800
uh we we the uh you know once they once

1175
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,920
they have these

1176
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
um these specific requirements there

1177
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,839
would be they would have to attest to

1178
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,800
the fact that they're meeting the

1179
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,599
standards

1180
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,880
and then there would be third-party

1181
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,200
assessment um to ensure that those

1182
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,000
performance standards

1183
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
are being met that's the first burden

1184
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
the second burden of big burden

1185
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
is that these companies are going to

1186
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
have to report all cyber incidents

1187
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,680
and not in days or weeks but in minutes

1188
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:39,920
or

1189
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,760
hours depending on what type of incident

1190
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,839
it is so that we can have a good

1191
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
indication of the pressures that our

1192
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,240
infrastructure is under at any one time

1193
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,880
and see and more easily see indications

1194
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,040
of a comprehensive attack

1195
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,920
in return for those those uh those uh

1196
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,560
burdens

1197
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,839
there will be benefits to these

1198
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,599
companies first we have to improve their

1199
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,200
intelligence support

1200
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,319
uh we will create the the authorizations

1201
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,440
for the director of national

1202
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,560
intelligence

1203
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,440
to share any intelligence indicating a

1204
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,960
cyber threat to their companies

1205
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
but also to tailor how we collect

1206
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,160
intelligence

1207
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
to to to acknowledge the fact that these

1208
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,000
critical infrastructures

1209
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,920
are in fact national assets that have to

1210
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,280
be protected

1211
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,839
that has not been the traditional

1212
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,520
collection mechanism of the

1213
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,440
of the of our national intelligence

1214
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,359
agencies and finally probably most

1215
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,720
importantly the companies

1216
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,520
if they meet the security certification

1217
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,960
requirements if the assessments are

1218
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,079
satisfactory

1219
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,119
and they're subject to a an attack from

1220
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,240
uh you know from a

1221
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,480
advanced persistent team or a large

1222
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,000
criminal enterprise

1223
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
they'll be they'll be free of of uh of

1224
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
liability associated with that loss of

1225
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,520
services

1226
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,200
this assumes no dare election by the

1227
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,359
company but they'd get some liability

1228
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,319
protection

1229
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,760
so what you ended up with are benefits

1230
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,119
and burdens and we think this is the

1231
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,319
model that we're gonna that you know

1232
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,760
most democracies are gonna have to go

1233
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,319
through

1234
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,520
most countries that don't have

1235
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
state-owned energy significant

1236
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,319
state-owned enterprises

1237
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,400
you're going to have to do a better job

1238
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
building this public-private compact

1239
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,640
so you're going to see a big push for us

1240
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,480
on that final thing i'll point out

1241
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,920
um we we have required a cyber

1242
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,319
mission force force structure assessment

1243
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,319
you know this is on the offensive side

1244
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,400
we recognize that so we put into law

1245
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,599
that said look

1246
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,359
the current sizes have a mission force

1247
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,240
we'll say 133 teams you know 6 000 on

1248
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,760
net operators

1249
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,160
that was based on 2012 threat

1250
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,960
assessments in 2013 kind of mission sets

1251
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,720
well as eric has mentioned though the

1252
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,000
mission sets have changed with this

1253
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
persistent engagement

1254
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
the threat assessments of china and

1255
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
russia have changed it's clear that they

1256
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,680
need

1257
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
another and our estimate was between 30

1258
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,040
and 50 percent

1259
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,720
we are exceptionally and so he ordered

1260
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,079
up a four structures assessment that

1261
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,839
says over the next 24 months

1262
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,760
come back with the builds to get

1263
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,520
yourself up to the proper size

1264
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,200
but general nakasana has already shown

1265
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,640
back up reportedly

1266
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,359
um uh this is in the in the u.s press

1267
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,319
with a 10

1268
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,560
growth already just in this year they're

1269
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,240
over that this year they'll begin to

1270
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
fund a two-year growth of 10

1271
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
so i would guess that would be from 133

1272
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,119
uh cyber you know uh teams in the summer

1273
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,280
mission force to 147 teams

1274
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
we think this is a great down payment uh

1275
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,400
what will eventually be a 30 to 40 to 50

1276
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,880
growth over five you know four five six

1277
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,680
years

1278
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,599
so uh we're you know there we're seeing

1279
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,880
some success

1280
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,720
uh in this critical infrastructure i

1281
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,920
talked about we'll have to see if we can

1282
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,960
get the law through but

1283
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
we're having a lot more success

1284
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,720
post-colonial on the hill

1285
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,160
uh getting this kind of thing through so

1286
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,079
i think which you'll see long term at

1287
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
the end of this year when the commission

1288
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,640
stands down

1289
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,079
if we're able to get these last couple

1290
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,720
things done as we've been able to

1291
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,440
uh through both authorized authorities

1292
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,760
and

1293
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,920
appropriations improve our overall

1294
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,520
investment in defense

1295
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,000
through the authorities we're giving and

1296
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
the laws are passing improve that public

1297
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,119
private collaboration

1298
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,960
and finally through the appropriations

1299
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,800
of the work of the department of defense

1300
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
improve the commitment and instantiating

1301
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,319
defend

1302
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,960
forward as a concept if we can do those

1303
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,520
three things

1304
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,119
i think we'll met the overall goals of

1305
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,200
the report excited to take any questions

1306
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,280
on these issues but i i pass it back to

1307
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
you amy

1308
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
thank you so much mark and we do have uh

1309
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,720
quite a few questions to go through so

1310
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:18,960
uh

1311
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,040
should be a good discussion first one is

1312
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
the cyberspace salary commission is a

1313
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,440
fully public document

1314
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,800
what do you think is the reason for this

1315
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,359
decision and what effect do you expect

1316
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,319
us to have

1317
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,800
in a broader international context so

1318
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,680
maybe um

1319
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
brandon if i ask you to kick this off

1320
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,839
and then erica mark

1321
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,799
if you'd like to add that

1322
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,880
yeah i think mark can speak best about

1323
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,400
why it was so public um but in many ways

1324
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,319
we avoided having a

1325
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,480
classified annex and the type of things

1326
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,760
that uh happen

1327
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,960
quite um commonly in this field and

1328
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,720
it's it's it was a goal of ours to avoid

1329
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,119
that because it's important to signal

1330
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,520
exactly what we're doing and again back

1331
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,400
it gets back to the

1332
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,560
the basic doctor strange lobbying idea

1333
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,520
of

1334
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
why didn't you tell them so if we're

1335
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,960
going to develop a strategy to

1336
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
discourage

1337
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,640
cyber actions we need to communicate

1338
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,520
such strategy

1339
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,440
and that was very much important for us

1340
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,480
and it's very much important for

1341
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,680
national security

1342
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,200
so everything we're doing is out in the

1343
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,359
open because this is a very open process

1344
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,079
because

1345
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,400
cyber is one of the most uh despite it

1346
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,440
being covert

1347
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
is one of the most known and open

1348
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,839
domains that we've ever seen for

1349
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,240
conflict

1350
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,760
mark i'll pick up on that so brandon's

1351
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,599
right for the strategic reason

1352
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,480
you you had in the signaling reason um

1353
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,839
he had this openness

1354
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,599
at a process level this really comes

1355
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,119
from senator mccain

1356
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,400
um mccain wanted law

1357
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
uh done from this he the only reason he

1358
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,599
supported the commission he was not a

1359
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,960
big fan of commissions

1360
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,680
was that he wanted legislative proposals

1361
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,960
um let's say propose

1362
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,720
one of the good things about uh the

1363
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,160
united states and most of our

1364
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,960
democratic uh allies is that our laws

1365
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,720
are unclassified we don't

1366
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,800
secret laws aren't really good laws so

1367
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,960
we really needed to write the report

1368
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
in the medium in which we would write

1369
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,400
the laws and that medium was the

1370
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,520
unclassified

1371
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,960
environment so we worked really hard it

1372
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,440
was hardest on erica uh working in her

1373
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,839
uh task force one area but for all of us

1374
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,079
we wrote in the unclassified medium

1375
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,000
sometimes we were informed by classified

1376
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
knowledge but the whole idea was to be

1377
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,560
able to write

1378
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,240
law at the end of it and to write law

1379
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,720
the best laws unclassified law

1380
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
and uh and to do that we need to stay

1381
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,439
unclassified

1382
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,760
eric would you like to add anything to

1383
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,079
that are you happy

1384
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,000
i think my colleagues basically covered

1385
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,200
it but i i would just

1386
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,880
emphasize again you know i think that

1387
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,119
there there's an

1388
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,440
inherent value in transparency and i

1389
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,480
think it reflects

1390
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,000
you know uh broadly speaking democratic

1391
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,160
values and something that was important

1392
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,440
for the commission and

1393
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,520
you know the other the one audience that

1394
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,960
um that wasn't mentioned it was the

1395
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,440
american

1396
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
the american people itself um and so

1397
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,800
this was something that

1398
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,280
um it was important i think for our for

1399
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,319
our commissioners

1400
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,079
that um we had a transparent process and

1401
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,839
a public-facing document that

1402
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,560
would be um sort of consumable by by the

1403
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,760
american people

1404
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
and uh you know in addition to of course

1405
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,880
our allies and partners and

1406
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,440
other constituents in uh you know within

1407
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,720
the government but you know but the

1408
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
american people is an important consumer

1409
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,119
um particularly given the role of of

1410
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,160
every individual

1411
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,960
in you know in helping secure the

1412
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,040
resilience of the cyber ecosystem and

1413
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,400
then finally i guess i would just add

1414
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,960
that

1415
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,079
um you know in addition to

1416
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,440
the fact that we don't have sort of

1417
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,280
secret laws in democracy

1418
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
if we need to work if collaborating with

1419
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,720
the private sector is meant to be a

1420
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
foundation of the strategy

1421
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,000
then to be able to more um seamlessly

1422
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,560
and and easily facilitate bringing that

1423
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,400
stakeholder into the room those

1424
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,200
conversations have to be transparent um

1425
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
and open and not secret and so i think

1426
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,800
that was another motivation behind

1427
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
uh behind the transparency of our

1428
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,480
initiative

1429
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
brilliant thank you and another question

1430
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,920
where i think

1431
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,960
all of you uh can answer is this

1432
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
discussion this panel was originally set

1433
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
to take place last year at psychon 2020

1434
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,559
and was of course cancelled

1435
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,800
uh due to clovid since then there have

1436
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,720
been various developments that

1437
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,440
um you've mentioned how have your

1438
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,280
assessments of the commission changed

1439
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,240
over the last year

1440
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,559
i'll go first on that as the executive

1441
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,079
director ross says first i think in the

1442
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,559
year

1443
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,319
um since uh cycon 2020 was scheduled

1444
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,240
uh we've gotten a lot you we at

1445
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,480
psychology we would have had the product

1446
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,880
and the aspiration uh and i probably

1447
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,599
would have briefed

1448
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,359
well you know we might get 10 to 12

1449
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,640
legislative proposals done

1450
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,839
so the first thing i'll tell you is

1451
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,000
we're a lot more successful and believe

1452
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,760
it or not covid helped our commission

1453
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,040
just the way we worked

1454
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,520
having legislators we had constant

1455
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,280
virtual access to the congressional

1456
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,000
staffs

1457
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,839
and we were able to work actually more

1458
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,079
efficiently in a coveted environment

1459
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,040
that that is

1460
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,240
not a common uh you know uh

1461
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,079
attribute and so we were fortunate in

1462
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,400
that regard we got more done i i did not

1463
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,079
understand the value

1464
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,280
of representative langevin

1465
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
representative gallagher senator king

1466
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,839
senator sas

1467
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,839
to the process this is where mccain was

1468
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,280
senator mccain was really

1469
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,599
enlightened he insisted on these four

1470
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,720
members being there

1471
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,359
you know over the objection of other

1472
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,680
senators and congressmen who didn't want

1473
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,200
you know uh um current legislators on

1474
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,960
commissions usually you have former

1475
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,640
legislators on commissions

1476
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,119
but mccain insisted on it and and uh you

1477
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,119
know the insight he had really came

1478
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,319
forward with a lot more

1479
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,640
the second thing i would say is colonial

1480
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,599
and

1481
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,640
um and solarwinds and others have given

1482
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,839
us a second life like

1483
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,240
again if you'd asked me six months ago

1484
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,599
or you know last november

1485
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,839
how much we're going to get done this uh

1486
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,200
this legislative cycle i would have

1487
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,000
thought you know

1488
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
five to ten proposals maximum now i

1489
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,079
think it's more realistic 15 or 20 and

1490
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,319
two very significant ones are in play

1491
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,480
but i don't think were before so the

1492
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,359
adversary

1493
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,599
over the last year has moved our goal

1494
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,280
you know has moved our goal posts a

1495
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
little closer he's made it more clear

1496
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,680
to both the american public but also

1497
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,200
american companies

1498
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,720
and our um and our legislators that

1499
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,280
action is required so i'm more

1500
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,119
optimistic every six months

1501
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,559
that's probably because the condition's

1502
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,440
more pessimistic

1503
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,480
yeah i would add that our work has

1504
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
gotten more important but the other

1505
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,400
thing too

1506
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
is that um we have learned to work

1507
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,960
uh virtually and uh that demonstrates a

1508
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,720
change in dc because it's always been

1509
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,240
said that if you're outside of virginia

1510
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,599
and maryland that

1511
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,520
you don't exactly have an impact on u.s

1512
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,119
policy but that's obviously

1513
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,760
changed and i remember very quite fondly

1514
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,720
one of our senators and commissioners um

1515
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,200
took very many meetings on an rv so um

1516
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,559
we were able to work from just about

1517
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,720
anywhere and that just demonstrated that

1518
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,240
things have changed and i look forward

1519
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,760
to our future um

1520
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,000
including more people in the policy

1521
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,040
process

1522
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,319
erica yeah i know i definitely concur

1523
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,839
with that as someone who is uh

1524
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,599
physically based in the new york metro

1525
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,960
area and traveling to

1526
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,200
washington for uh for a lot of the

1527
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,160
commission's work

1528
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,440
um i think it's uh we've sort of

1529
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,200
validated the idea that we can

1530
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,520
work in a dispersed uh and virtual

1531
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,240
environment

1532
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,440
um i would also add that the um you know

1533
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,079
the

1534
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,920
pandemic gave us the opportunity to

1535
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,839
expand our work product

1536
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,520
we put out a number of different white

1537
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
papers um

1538
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,960
between march 2020 and uh and and today

1539
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,640
one of which actually explored the

1540
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,040
implications of the pandemic for

1541
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,119
um first how we think about or sorry the

1542
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,160
implications of

1543
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,839
of our work on cyber security for how we

1544
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,599
think about the pandemic particularly

1545
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,400
given

1546
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,599
um you know the increasing importance of

1547
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,160
uh of the digital environment for uh for

1548
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,000
continuing uh

1549
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,839
for for enabling all of our economies to

1550
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,839
continue to to function

1551
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,760
uh during this pandemic um so that was

1552
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,440
an important opportunity as well as a

1553
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,960
supply chain white paper

1554
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,400
and others and so um you know i

1555
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,800
i think that we were able to capitalize

1556
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,520
where we could on opportunities despite

1557
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,640
being in a very challenging um

1558
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,960
you know global uh global crisis

1559
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,520
brilliant thank you we have had a number

1560
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,079
of questions

1561
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,760
come in on the theme of deterrence and

1562
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,119
layered deterrence so i'm going to try

1563
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:39,440
and

1564
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,240
bundle a few of those up for you first

1565
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,119
one is

1566
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,920
how can other allies nato countries or

1567
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,760
the alliance in general

1568
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,000
fit within the principles outlined by

1569
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,119
the commission

1570
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,559
on the issue of layered deterrence

1571
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,720
thinking and

1572
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,200
more broadly how does the commission how

1573
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,079
do we

1574
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
deal with the fact that some of these

1575
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,160
concepts might be considered

1576
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,400
out of date by some of the community uh

1577
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,599
talking about deterrence talk about

1578
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,400
persistent engagement

1579
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,480
um if i pass back to erica first maybe

1580
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,680
then mark then brandon sure

1581
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,680
no those are great questions um and i

1582
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,200
guess just to take the first part of the

1583
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
question about the role of allies and

1584
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,680
partners

1585
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,240
you know it was essential in terms of

1586
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,040
our thinking

1587
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,200
on the commission's work even though we

1588
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,240
were

1589
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,599
focused on the united states because

1590
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,359
that was that was our the purpose of our

1591
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,000
commission

1592
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,520
as mark mentioned and i think as brandon

1593
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,440
mentioned too we did um

1594
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,240
a number of engagements with um

1595
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,680
international partners

1596
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,800
and um allies and partners were a

1597
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,480
critical element in our strategic

1598
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,960
thinking

1599
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,599
both in terms of the sort of more

1600
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,920
obvious straightforward areas where

1601
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,599
um you know the united where we

1602
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,680
advocated for more robust cyber

1603
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,680
diplomacy and for the united states to

1604
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,160
work

1605
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,079
um to engage and work collaboratively

1606
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,480
with allies and partners to promote and

1607
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,920
sustain and enforce

1608
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,440
norms of acceptable behavior um but also

1609
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,640
in the sort of um more uh

1610
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,200
offensive or sort of proactive areas of

1611
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,160
defend forward task force one for

1612
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,079
instance um had a number of

1613
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,680
um uh analysis and recommendations about

1614
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,960
how to think about

1615
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,599
um defending forward in cooperation or

1616
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,200
coordination with allies and partners

1617
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,400
and i think we've seen this in

1618
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,640
implementation a bit um

1619
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,520
you know as um there have been more uh

1620
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,119
more instances have been publicly

1621
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:33,920
reported

1622
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,960
of sort of the implementation of hunt

1623
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,000
forward

1624
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,040
missions that have involved uh dod

1625
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,079
collaborating with

1626
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,480
um the defense forces of allies and

1627
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,520
partners to

1628
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,240
proactively sort of threat hunt on um

1629
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,760
allied and partner networks and share

1630
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,800
information with

1631
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,920
appropriate stakeholders so um i i think

1632
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,400
it was

1633
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,319
uh certainly a deliberate part of our

1634
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,319
process and of our sort of philosophy

1635
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,760
and thinking about the strategy and its

1636
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,040
implementation

1637
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,240
um the second question about whether

1638
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,839
deterrence is kind of a

1639
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,839
outdated concept i would sort of

1640
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,280
respectfully disagree

1641
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,599
with the premise both on philosophical

1642
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,480
grounds and also

1643
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,200
on sort of policy-making grounds because

1644
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,599
the reality is that

1645
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,400
this is the foundation of u.s cyber

1646
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,000
policy and so

1647
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,920
this is how practitioners within the

1648
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,440
federal government are

1649
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,359
um thinking and operating on a daily

1650
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,559
basis and

1651
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,240
um so i think that it you know it's

1652
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,040
it's not that these uh concepts are

1653
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,200
outdated

1654
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,359
rather i think the commission took the

1655
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,880
perspective that

1656
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,839
we need to sort of reject the outdated

1657
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,119
sort of cold war nuclear

1658
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,400
deterrence-based

1659
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,160
models because they are not the right

1660
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,400
fit for strategic challenges in

1661
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,480
cyberspace and instead

1662
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
articulate a vision for deterrence that

1663
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,240
makes sense for this domain and

1664
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,839
this gets at you know what i was saying

1665
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,839
earlier what brandon was saying as well

1666
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,680
how we measure success and think about

1667
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,880
outcomes it's not

1668
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,079
sort of the absence of the use of force

1669
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:08,319
at

1670
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,799
all but rather being more deliberate

1671
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,480
about how we define

1672
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,880
what are the things we are trying to

1673
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,280
reduce the magnitude and frequency of

1674
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,200
um how do we define what's systemically

1675
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,359
important you can't ever get to zero in

1676
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,040
cyberspace and so

1677
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,640
um you know rather than sort of throw

1678
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,040
the

1679
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,119
deterrence baby out with the bathwater

1680
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,880
we

1681
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
aim to sort of reimagine this concept

1682
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,240
and make it meaningful for

1683
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,880
this domain in particular but i'm sure

1684
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,760
brandon will have

1685
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,040
have more to say on this topic

1686
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,000
oh no not at all exactly what erica said

1687
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,720
is

1688
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,200
exactly right and exactly important only

1689
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,480
thing i would add is that

1690
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,680
probably the most disappointing thing

1691
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,920
about the pandemic is giving it a chance

1692
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,079
to really promote our ideas in person

1693
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,000
but on the other hand we started doing a

1694
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,960
lot of virtual presentations and virtual

1695
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,760
options that maybe reach more people but

1696
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,440
we missed out on the dinners we missed

1697
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,400
out on the

1698
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,920
you know the happy hours the things that

1699
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,160
people do to communicate in this policy

1700
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,799
space and

1701
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,799
uh i look forward to getting back to

1702
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,599
that soon mark

1703
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,040
uh i don't but uh teach their own um

1704
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,680
but what i would say is um is that the

1705
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,079
allies

1706
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,520
i'll go back on the first part uh the

1707
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,440
allies and partners issue look most of

1708
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,359
our allies and partners are democracies

1709
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,920
most democracies suffer from the problem

1710
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,200
of competing

1711
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,359
in the gray zone you know where your

1712
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,200
adversary russia or china

1713
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,280
or criminal actor is operating below the

1714
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,599
level which you're going to respond

1715
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,520
and this is very hard for democracy so i

1716
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,040
think what we wrote

1717
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,200
is equally true you absolutely have to

1718
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,160
defend yourself

1719
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,079
because it'll be times when you don't do

1720
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,599
any you know where

1721
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,119
the idea of cost and position isn't

1722
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,680
effective so um i think you have to

1723
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,960
do that but i also think you need to

1724
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,880
develop your cost and position

1725
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,359
capabilities below that level of the

1726
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,040
traditional use of force and that's

1727
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,720
where defend forward comes in

1728
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,680
so i think what we wrote is equally uh

1729
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,200
applicable to allies and partners one

1730
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,520
other thing i'd add is attribution

1731
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,440
attribution is going to be critical in

1732
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,520
two ways one getting information from

1733
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,720
our allies and partners so we can do

1734
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,319
more effective attribution

1735
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,760
since an adversary may have moved

1736
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,400
through their electronic battle space

1737
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,720
but then secondly providing attribution

1738
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,839
more rapidly

1739
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,000
you know not too long within the last

1740
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,040
year the us and

1741
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,720
uk were excited that we were able to

1742
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,680
name an attack in georgia on russia and

1743
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,359
attribute it explicitly to them

1744
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,040
three months after it happened you know

1745
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
attribution needs to move into that

1746
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,839
into the minutes and hours not the days

1747
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,200
weeks and months

1748
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,960
that we tend to have now and part of

1749
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,520
that is being able to share information

1750
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,000
more fluidly more flexibly or agility

1751
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,119
with your um

1752
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,240
with your allies and partners brilliant

1753
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,760
thank you and with two minutes on the

1754
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,440
clock i'll shoot one quick question back

1755
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,880
to mark

1756
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,799
is the federal government going to pay

1757
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,319
for third party audits of critical

1758
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,760
national infrastructure companies

1759
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,920
what does this private public uh

1760
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,720
cooperation look like going forward

1761
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,480
so that'll be one of the things we

1762
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,000
negotiate in there i think

1763
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,559
it'll um look they need most of these

1764
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,160
companies already do the third party

1765
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,960
assessments

1766
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,400
as part of their cyber insurance

1767
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,480
portfolios so i think we'll be okay

1768
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,680
would it be is they'll have to be done

1769
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,119
to a standard

1770
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,839
that the government is is um uh

1771
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:22,720
establishing

1772
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,000
and i think that'll be the difference

1773
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,280
and to the degree that there's a delta

1774
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,319
in that cost

1775
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,440
maybe the federal government would be

1776
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,799
involved in it but i think that's a

1777
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,240
minor element

1778
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,520
of this overall uh bill and like as i

1779
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,599
said we're talking about 200 to 250 of

1780
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,720
our biggest

1781
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,680
critical functions um i think the vast

1782
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,280
vast vast majority are doing those

1783
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,559
self-assessments now

1784
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,400
not a hundred percent and i would have

1785
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
warned you that pipelines

1786
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,760
water wastewater and um how big healthy

1787
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,400
human

1788
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,640
health service providers were three of

1789
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,880
the ones where we felt we had a weakness

1790
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,920
and there may not have been those

1791
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,520
assessments going on

1792
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,760
um so we'll have to see what happens but

1793
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,599
i think it's actually a minor element of

1794
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,000
this

1795
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,319
is that cost but if it's necessary i

1796
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,440
think that's something the government

1797
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,559
could do

1798
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,960
brilliant thank you very much and uh of

1799
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,400
course there are questions streaming in

1800
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,160
and we could be here for a while but we

1801
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,400
are

1802
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,720
out of time so huge thank you to the

1803
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,319
audience for your engagement and a huge

1804
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,359

on the commission thank you thanks

1809

thank you
