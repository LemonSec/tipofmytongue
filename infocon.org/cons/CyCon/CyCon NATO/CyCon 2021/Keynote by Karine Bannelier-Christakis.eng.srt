addressing the topic of unilateral cyber

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,800
actions by governments

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:59,839
please karin the floor is yours

so thank you very much and good

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
afternoon to everybody

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,840
and let's start with this presentation

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,240
um on november 1946

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
the british royal navy undermined

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
clearance operations the corfu channel

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,479
in reaction to the strikes of two of its

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,040
destroyers by floating miles

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
this operation took place in albanian

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
territorial waters

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
without albania's permission these

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
events led to the famous corfu channel

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
case

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
during the hearings at the icj operation

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
retail

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
was supported by the uk as an exercise

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,680
of

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
limited right of self-help however

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
in its landmark judgment of 1949

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,680
the icg refused to accept the defense of

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
self-help

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
or self-protection and declared that the

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
action of the british navy constituted

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
the violation

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
of albanian sovereignty while

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
maintaining that albania

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
was liable for the presence of the minds

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
70 years on in cyberspace floating mines

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,440
have become self-replicating worms

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
and malicious web shells and zombie

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,879
botnets

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
are situating worldwide in cyberspace

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
i.t systems are to be being struck

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
by ransomware and his operations

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
are being allowed by states law

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
enforcement agencies

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,120
using their law enforcement agencies and

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
judicial

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
authorizations mechanisms some states

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
have decided to act forcefully and to

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
undertake cyber actions in order to

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,640
neutralize

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
malicious servers dismantle botnets

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
patch vulnerabilities and clean up

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
infected computers

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
this operation can have a purely

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
national scope

72
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
but they can also have an important

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
international dimension

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
whether by directly targeting botnets

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,599
and zombie computers

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,159
located worldwide on other state

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360
territories

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
or by impacting system located

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,959
on the trajectory of other states

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
for states that are undertaking this

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,560
operation

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
such operations are necessary and

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,239
legitimate

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
they cause vulnerability reduce cyber

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,760
risk

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
and help the victims however this

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,519
operation

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,400
raise important questions are set in a

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
position to sweep the web

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
do they have the technical skills to do

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
this properly

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
without causing collateral damage do

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
they have a right to act

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
and if so what are the limits of these

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,159
activities

96
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,480
could sweeping or patching operations

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,120
constitute violation of international

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
law and if so

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
what kind of violations last but not

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,840
least

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
can state involved right of help

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
the right of cell protection or right of

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
active cyber difference

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,439
when doing so if these operations

105
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
are expanded without being carefully

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,279
framed

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
there will become new cyber issues and

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,800
new grounds

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
for tension between states in cyberspace

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
so the objective of this presentation is

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,520
to

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
share some thought on these issues on

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
the basis on two cases

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
namely the fret adapters in france and

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
the hack to patch case

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,320
in the united states so

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
next slide please so let's start with a

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,919
brief

119
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,039
review of the two cases

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
first in 2019 the french cyber

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,639
fighting center which is a department of

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,400
law enforcement agencies

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
similar to the police announced that it

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,680
had

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
in cooperation with avast neutralized a

126
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
malicious server

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
which was at the head of a gigantic

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,440
botnet

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,520
infected by a rom called freitag

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,639
this botnet which involved at a time for

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,039
more

132
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
more than a 800 000 computer

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,039
was used for nefarious activity such as

134
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,000
the theft of

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
hospital data the use of ransomware

136
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
or the mining of the cryptocurrency

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
monero

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
and the command and control

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,160
infrastructure

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
was mostly located in france

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
after obtaining prosecutors

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,039
authorization

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
the french cyber crime crime fighting

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,080
center

145
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
in cooperation with avast dismantled

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
the malicious command and control

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
located in france

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
but it also disinfected rate adopts

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
victims

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,759
located in over 140 countries

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
to achieve this uh next slide please

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
to achieve this it replaced

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,319
the malicious server with a disinfection

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
server

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
which was designed to respond to an

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,880
incoming

157
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,919
request with a specific response that

158
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,560
caused

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
connected pieces of the malware to

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
self-destruct

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
the operation thus remotely disactivated

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
the virus in computers

163
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
around the world some months ago

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,280
in the hack-to-patch case the u.s dog

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
announced that the fbi had removed

166
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
malicious wages from hundreds of

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
computers

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
in the united states authorized by the

169
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
warrant issued by a judge

170
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,759
the api removed the malicious web shells

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
by issuing a comment from the webshells

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,319
to the server

173
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
which was designed to cause the server

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,919
to delete

175
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
only the web share

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,160
these two cases share several

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,639
similarities

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,800
the operations were conducted on the

179
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
basis of a warrant

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
issued by a judge they were conducted

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
on the basis of a public-private

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
partnership

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
part of them involved patching computers

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
and they were non-consensual it was done

185
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
secretly without the consent of the

186
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,080
owner

187
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,520
of the systems and in the case of france

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,800
without notifying or implicating

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,840
states where those computers were

190
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
located

191
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
the main differences between these two

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,039
cases seems to be the geographic scope

193
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
of the operations in the hack to patch

194
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
case the dog declared that the patching

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
operation was only conducted in relation

196
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
to computers located

197
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,479
in the u.s conversely in the retada case

198
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,440
the the activation operation was

199
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,160
conducted

200
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
in relation to computers locating all

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
over the world

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
a second difference could lie in the

203
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,000
technical side

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
of these operations but we do not

205
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
in fact have enough technical

206
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,319
information

207
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
to precisely assess these differences

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,240
if any exists however what is i think

209
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
important to note here

210
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
is that the french cyber crime fighting

211
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
center underlined

212
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
that the operation was conducted without

213
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,040
intruding into the infected computers

214
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
with the u.s hack to patch case there is

215
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,519
less detail

216
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
about the operation it is therefore

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
difficult to assess

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
precisely the degree of intrusion

219
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
into the targeted system

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
as we see as we will see

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
these differences could have legal

222
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
implications in particular

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399
at the international level but before

224
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,839
legal analysis

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,720
it is interesting to note that these two

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
operations

227
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,959
were greeted by many observers

228
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,240
while others fewer in number maybe

229
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
criticize this action arguing that they

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,519
were

231
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,240
dangerous

232
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,399
legal considerations very few states

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,200
have addressed

234
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
the issue of the legal framework that

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
should be followed with regard to the

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
law enforcement activities described in

237
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
this presentation

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
nevertheless some states have put

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,839
forward their position

240
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
on the principle of sovereignty and the

241
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
prohibition of intervention

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
in cyberspace based on these positions

243
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
a legal analysis of law enforcement

244
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,320
activities can be conducted

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
taking into account the geographical

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,680
scope

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
of the activity whether it is deployed

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
in the territory

249
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
of the states which undertakes the

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
operation

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
or whether it is deployed or has

252
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,959
effects on the territory of other states

253
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,079
with regard to the internal dimension of

254
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,000
law enforcement operations

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
two main questions should be asked in

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
relation to the principle of sovereignty

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
first can states act the answer is yes

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,279
all states agree that sovereignty

259
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
applies in cyberspace

260
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
and it is generally accepted that law

261
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
enforcement

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,079
forms part of a state's means of

263
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,120
exercising

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,640
its sovereignty states can only act

265
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
within the limit of their obligation

266
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
under international law

267
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
in this regard it is important to ensure

268
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
that patching operations then do not

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
infringe

270
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,079
upon the right to privacy and protection

271
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,519
of personal data

272
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,040
or if an infringement does a cure

273
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
certain conditions such as necessity and

274
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,279
proportionality should be

275
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
respected second must

276
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
state act it is traditionally accepted

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
that sovereignty implies

278
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
obligation and especially the obligation

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,120
of state

280
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
not to allow the immediate territory to

281
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
be used for act contrary to the rights

282
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
of other states

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
this is the famous due diligence

284
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
principle

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
but what can this principle tell us

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
about law enforcement cases

287
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
in the repadab case we have a malicious

288
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,279
server which is located in france

289
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
which causes damages through the world

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
we also have french authorities who know

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,839
about

292
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,639
it and who think that they have the

293
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,600
technical

294
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
means to neutralize it in this case

295
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
france could maybe say that it acted

296
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
diligently but did france

297
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
have an obligation to act might one

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
suggest that france breached

299
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
its due diligence obligation in the case

300
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,200
she had not

301
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
undertaken the cleaning activities

302
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,399
i think that the answer is complex

303
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
because jones is as we all know an

304
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
obligation of conduct not of result

305
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
and its violation depends not only on

306
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
the capacity of the states but also on

307
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,680
the damage inflicted on third state

308
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,720
and even if one claims that france had

309
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
an obligation to neutralize the

310
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
malicious server

311
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
on its territory this does not mean that

312
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,120
it

313
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
also had an obligation to undertake the

314
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,880
cleaning

315
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,800
operations in the recorder case

316
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
the operation had notable

317
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,399
extraterrestrial

318
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
effect while the fbi's operation

319
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
was presented as only targeting system

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,839
located

321
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,839
on your statory however one might raise

322
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
the question about the implications of

323
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,519
such an operation

324
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,240
if it had had collateral effects abroad

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
so the question is to what extent could

326
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,279
this operation

327
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
be considered ill illegal interventions

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,839
or at least violations of state

329
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,200
sovereignty with regard to

330
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
illegal interventions the answer is

331
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,120
undoubtedly

332
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
no indeed to qualify as a wrongful

333
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,760
intervention

334
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
the operation must meet two cumulative

335
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
criteria

336
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
firstly that it interferes with the

337
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
domain resurvey of the form state

338
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,680
and secondly that it involves coercion

339
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,639
it appears here difficult i think to

340
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,839
assimilate

341
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,399
these infection operations into acts of

342
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,440
question

343
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,279
against foreign states it is true that

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
the criterion of interference

345
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
appears more questionable however since

346
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,279
the criterion of question seems to be

347
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,079
absent

348
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,480
i will not discuss this question here

349
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,560
but i will address this issue later in

350
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
relation to the question of the

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,560
violation

352
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,199
of sovereignty with regard to the

353
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
valuation of sovereignty the answer is

354
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,399
probably more nuanced

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
when we analyze the position of state

356
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,079
regarding violation

357
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,320
of sovereignty in cyberspace three

358
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,279
criteria

359
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
seems to command attention first

360
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,519
impeachment upon the target

361
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
state state or integrity and it seems

362
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,360
here that states don't always regard a

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,440
non-conceptual intrusion into cyber

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
infrastructures as a violation of state

365
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,560
sovereignty

366
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
but whatever what is important to note

367
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,839
is that

368
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,480
in our cases the available facts do not

369
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,320
seem to indicate that there was an

370
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
intrusion on the territory of

371
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
another state second for many states

372
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
the principle of sovereignty prohibits

373
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
interference by your state

374
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
in the henrietta governmental function

375
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
of another state

376
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
what constitutes inherently governmental

377
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
function is of course a matter of debate

378
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
but it's irresonable to consider that

379
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,160
states law enforcement actions

380
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,120
is aegis inherently orientation when

381
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,079
exercising

382
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,360
investigative powers however

383
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
patching vulnerabilities neutralities

384
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,839
and worms are disinfecting

385
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
zombie computers does not seem to

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
constitute the exercising of

387
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
investigative powers and it is therefore

388
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
difficult to equate it to

389
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,519
another position of governmental

390
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
function

391
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,480
effect in the case it is

392
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,440
indisputable that the action

393
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
had effect on the territory of third

394
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,880
states

395
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
but to our knowledge the effects were

396
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
positive

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,839
no damage occurred on the contrary

398
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,800
the one was neutralized on hundreds of

399
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
thousands of computers

400
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,079
in the hot to patch case on the basis of

401
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,759
the non-elements

402
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
it does not appear that the api's

403
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
action has direct effects on the

404
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,199
territory of those states

405
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,759
but either way it is very likely that

406
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
the rate adapt operation

407
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
is not unique or at least will not

408
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,079
remain unique for long

409
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,880
it is therefore necessary to think about

410
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,839
the effects

411
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
of law enforcement operation in the

412
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
cyberspace

413
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,440
while time is running i here just

414
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
ask here a few questions first

415
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
what is the nature of the effects do

416
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,880
they have to be

417
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
physical or should we also include

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
non-physical effects

419
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
second do the effects have to be

420
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
negative

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
third it says what is the threshold of

422
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,759
the damage

423
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,880
does the damage have to be significant

424
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,440
should we only take into account the

425
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,160
expected

426
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,759
effects or also the unexpected effects

427
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
should we only take into account the

428
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,959
direct effects

429
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,560
or also the current collateral effects

430
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
maybe many other questions could arise

431
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
but

432
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,079
if i i want to take some collect some

433
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
question i will here conclude

434
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,480
conclusion so no violation of

435
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
international law no problem

436
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
that is a question as we have seen it is

437
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
difficult to qualify these operations

438
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
as violations of international law

439
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
this is also confirmed by the fact that

440
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,919
no state filed a protest

441
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,320
in respect with ratadap or the

442
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
hard-to-patch case

443
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,039
which is i think uh extremely

444
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,919
interesting

445
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,520
to underline this is does not mean

446
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
however that all these operations are

447
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
acceptable if so facto and that we

448
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,320
should not

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
try to frame them in some cases

450
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
they could be a violation of third

451
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
states law

452
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
prohibiting and authorized access to i.t

453
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
systems so i would like to submit two

454
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
proposals

455
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
first in many cases these operations are

456
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,559
legitimate

457
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,960
and constitute an answer to a strong

458
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
need

459
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,120
in this respect it could be interesting

460
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
turning around

461
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
the notion of self-help self-protection

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,240
or

463
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
active cyber defense to determine

464
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
when and how law enforcement agencies

465
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,160
can engage in such operations

466
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
second when law enforcement agencies

467
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
engage in such clean sync operation

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
they must act responsibly and it would

469
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,039
be interesting to establish

470
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,480
a series of criteria for responsible

471
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,679
behavior

472
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
as well as necessary safeguards

473
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,400
indeed if we don't do so there is a

474
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,679
clear danger

475
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
that some states might choose the

476
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,039
cleansing operation or how to patch

477
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
arguments as a pretext in order to

478
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
undertake malicious activities in the

479
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,559
territories of third states

480
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
in violation of their law prohibiting

481
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
an authorized access to i.t systems

482
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,600
thank you very much for your attention

483
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:23,280
[Music]

484
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,799
well thank you dr bandy kostakis for for

485
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
this interesting keynote speech

486
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,240
indicating some very some highly

487
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
important legal and policy

488
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,240
considerations uh like before let's open

489
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
up the floor to any questions from the

490
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
audience

491
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
yes and thank you also on my behalf and

492
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
we have a couple of

493
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
questions already uh from the audience

494
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
and first would i address uh actually

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,360
the the

496
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
question of due diligence that you also

497
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
addressed in your speech already

498
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,679
the question starts with the first part

499
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,360
is that would you argue that france

500
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
exercised the due diligence in the

501
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
rhetoric operation which i think you

502
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,799
also elaborated on

503
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
but the question actually carries on

504
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
that would the affected states

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
have had a response available under

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
international law

507
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,080
in case they would not agree with

508
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,439
france's course of action

509
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,320
well i think it depends on if uh

510
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,919
they are able to shout that uh france

511
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,360
uh make a violation of international law

512
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
and uh for my uh point of view uh

513
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,760
it was not the case so uh if states

514
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,480
can't

515
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760
uh show that france make a violation

516
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
of international law you know their

517
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
toolbox in order to react

518
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
to france action is much more limited

519
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
of course they can take action they

520
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
can't make protestation but they didn't

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
do that frankly speaking too much

522
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,080
knowledge

523
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,600
they can of course act by uh taking

524
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,640
other measures but outside you know the

525
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
the scope of countermeasures so of

526
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,559
course they can make protestation they

527
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,760
can hack with

528
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,960
nutrition measures they can even

529
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,280
adopt cyber sanction but

530
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,559
each time you know they can't adapt to

531
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,799
content measures which are reaction

532
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,080
against a violation of internationally

533
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,000
is it uh do i uh

534
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,039
yes thank you thank you thank you uh and

535
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,240
we have a second uh

536
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,159
question from the audience uh in your

537
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
opinion would the usa be liable for

538
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,200
trans transboundary harm had the hacked

539
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
patch operation affected

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
systems abroad

541
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
uh to my knowledge and with the element

542
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
i have for the time being

543
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
uh the u.s hack to patch uh operation

544
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,799
was located uh only on the u.s territory

545
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
and didn't make any damage

546
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,159
either in the u.s territory and of

547
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,880
course has no effect abroad but

548
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
for the time being and with the element

549
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
i know for the time being this is

550
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
the answer thank you so much

551
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,880
just a generic question uh perhaps as a

552
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,919
last one

553
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
uh just your opinion on on how does

554
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
these operations go together with the

555
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,559
french approach to sovereignty which

556
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,760
it uh published now two years ago

557
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,640
already

558
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
uh how do you see these uh do things go

559
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,918
together

560
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,039
well i think it's interesting because as

561
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,120
as you may be know

562
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,159
france has a an important uh

563
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
make important development on what is

564
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
sovereignty in the cyberspace and one

565
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
aspect of sovereignty is

566
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
of course exercising due diligence and

567
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
uh this is uh what's in france france

568
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
exercised sovereignty over information

569
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
system located on its territory

570
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
and in compliance with due diligence

571
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
requirements it ensures that its

572
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
territory is not used for

573
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
internationally wrongful arts using icts

574
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
this is the first part a second part

575
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,679
concern a french approach concerning

576
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,480
riches

577
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
of sovereignty and here

578
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,039
we can effectively think about uh

579
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,840
france what's france said about that

580
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
bridges of sovereignty could occur

581
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
when effects are made

582
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,200
on foreign countries and so uh

583
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
we can turn around i don't think that

584
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
france the approach of france was to say

585
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
that every fx

586
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,480
uh breaching state sovereignty

587
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,520
but maybe we we need to to develop this

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
aspect in order to to know exactly

589
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,559
what fonts mean on this uh on this

590
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,320
aspect

591
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
thank you thank you karine for these

592
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,919
answers and your

593
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,000
excellent speech i think this discussion

594
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
demonstrates really well

595
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,760
that there are still many nuances i dare

596
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,559
say to be

597
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
worked out in in international law and

598
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,080
states behavior and

599
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,559
the possibilities that states actually

600
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,039
what states could actually do

601
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,760
perhaps this could be also something

602
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,559
that

603
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,120
we are able to address in the tally

604
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,679
manual 3.

605
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000
yes
