in the last segment of this session now

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,239
let's start with our first presentation

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,520
by kim hartmann

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
kim you wrote a paper for psychon titled

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,840
adversary targeting of civilian

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
telecommunications infrastructure

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,440
explaining our dependency on

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
communications infrastructure

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
and how these can be targeted disrupted

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
and attacked

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
kim please the stage is yours

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,160
hello so thank you for having me here

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
i'm very excited

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
it's a great honor to be at cycon again

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
this year i've been

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
visiting saigon and speaking outside for

67
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
a couple of years but it's always great

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,680
to

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
to see all the faces again even if it's

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
just virtual

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
so i know one of the big difficulties

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
with cyclone is always to decide

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
on which stage should i actually attend

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,080
because there are so many interesting

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
talks going on at the same time

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
so what i want to do is to kind of help

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
you on the decision as

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
a start so if you feel that you are part

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,560
of a government

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
an organization or an agency that is to

81
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,879
a large extent relying on

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
private telecommunication then

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
i believe that you really should stay

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,599
because you will

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
need to be prepared for a new type of

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,640
attacks which are

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
going to be direct against the physical

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
infrastructure of these services

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
the same applies if you are part of an

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
enterprise that provides a t

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
services or products to a customer base

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
that is either big enough

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
crucial to uphold civilian lives and

94
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
structure

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
or part of governmental services or

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
utilized by those

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
because in that case you are always also

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,879
going to be

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
experiencing a new type of physical

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,159
attacks that we have not been

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,040
considering

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,879
that much in the past so

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
in the paper you will find a series of

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
events that have happened over the past

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,799
couple of 24

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,680
48 months but we have seen that our

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
infrastructure is indeed a danger

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
but the question that i'm going to

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,680
address right now is actually

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
what is new and why are we seeing these

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
types of events coming up now and why

112
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,160
should we need to prepare for them

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,358
directly so

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,160
what is new about this whole type of of

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
events or

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
why they are actually coming to an rise

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,960
recently

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
is that the aim of your adversaries is

119
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,720
now to control our information space

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
and we have seen that there are many of

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
ways to do so by cyber attacks

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
we have seen disinformation campaigns in

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
the past and what we are seeing now

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
is that our infrastructure is also

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
vulnerable to physical attacks in terms

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,759
of

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,160
destruction manipulation and rerouting

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
as i said the aim of all of these is

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
always to

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
control the information space the flow

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
of information through interdiction

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,039
interference and manipulation there are

133
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,080
details on why this is a type of

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
political activity that has been seen in

135
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
the past

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
it's in the paper i will not go into the

137
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,639
details but if you

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
would like to see them you can read the

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
paper

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
apart from that what i'm going to focus

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
on is the technical background to all of

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,960
these

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,840
so why are we seeing these type of

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
events coming up more recently now and

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
why are they that important to us so

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,600
what has

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
happened over the past couple of months

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
as we are all aware is that we have

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
had a growing dependency on

150
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
telecommunication even more than we've

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
had in the past already

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,000
what has also happened is about 20 years

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
from now on

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
we have started to put many things

155
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
away from the physical entity so when we

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
think about data or information

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,560
we do no longer think of the machine

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
that is hosting the data

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,560
we are thinking of it being somewhere in

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,280
the cloud

161
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
or at a vendor and what that will always

162
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
be available when we need it

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
this has actually made us wonderful

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
because we do not consider

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
the physical security of the devices

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,759
that are holding that data

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,520
or that or controlling our communication

168
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
flows there's also

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
another thing that really stroked my

170
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
mind is

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,759
that back when i went to university

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,639
which has been a couple of years now

173
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,759
we were talking so much about including

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
redundancy in our networks in our

175
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,880
software

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
in everything that we did as computer

177
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
scientists by now

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
redundancy is not such a big topic

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,520
anymore in the

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
syllabus of many curricula at the same

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
time

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
it is also it has been considered a

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
security vulnerability in the past

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
which has often been misunderstood

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
because people were thinking

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,120
that i.t security experts were saying

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
that you should get rid of redundancy

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
what they were actually trying to say is

189
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
that you should get rid of bad

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
redundancy

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
now unfortunately i could go on talking

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
about redundancy for a very long

193
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,599
time which i don't have the time to do

194
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,120
right now but it's something that we

195
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
really need to focus on

196
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
again in order to avoid being attacked

197
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
physically

198
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,360
so what we also have seen or some of the

199
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,199
examples we have seen in the past to

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,000
just give you some

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
ideas of the events that have happened

202
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
which

203
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
gave the input to this paper of course

204
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,880
one of the

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
the first ones was the att

206
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
bomb detonation in nashville tennessee

207
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
on christmas day 2020

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
which actually led to a complete

209
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
communication breakdown from georgia to

210
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
kentucky

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
including the 911 call centers and

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
hospitals

213
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
we have also seen the ovh data center in

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
strasbourg france burning down

215
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,240
in march 2021 which also which had a

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,199
tremendous effect

217
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
of 3.6 million websites being

218
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
temporarily unavailable

219
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
some of them actually were governmental

220
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
portals

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
so while these two have been accidents

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
um or um incidents that have not been

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,039
considered as

224
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,680
as being attacks they show us something

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,479
very important

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,479
namely the vulnerability of or

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,759
infrastructure to such

228
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,120
types of interferences with them it is a

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,599
way

230
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
of interfering with cyberspace that we

231
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
generally do not consider any longer

232
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
because it's considered physical

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
security

234
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
and physical security is something that

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
cyber security experts

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
do not consider as much as they should

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
it's also has also been a couple of

238
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,279
other

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
attacks on the other domains so in the

240
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,320
paper

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
we have divided the events that we have

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,519
seen

243
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,279
into land air sea or sub-sea

244
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,920
and space activities some of them

245
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,800
actually being

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,959
true activities others being incidents

247
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
so the messages

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
that i'm trying to get across with this

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,839
paper or that we are trying to get

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
across with this paper

251
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
is first of all to remind you all that

252
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,720
cyber is not

253
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
abstract everything that you put in

254
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
cyber is

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,959
a real physical machine or a

256
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,399
communication link at

257
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
some specific location we are also going

258
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
to see

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
a rise in the number of physical attacks

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
against digital assets

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
this is something that is often

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
underrepresented and neglected during

263
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
the planning which is

264
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
why our physical systems are now being

265
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
attacked instead of

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
just our cyber systems

267
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
and the third thing that i would like to

268
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
get across is that we need to prepare

269
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
for these types of attacks we need to

270
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
install

271
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
especially as governmental agencies we

272
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
need to install

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
fail-safe communication links to uphold

274
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,640
during

275
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,560
um during cyber conflicts in order to be

276
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
to be able to communicate with our

277
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,760
civilians

278
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
the same of course applies to vendors

279
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
you need to prepare for these types of

280
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
attacks against your physical properties

281
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,680
in order

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
to uphold your services even during

283
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,120
during times of conflict

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
so if you feel that you can answer any

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,839
of these questions

286
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,760
um with yes then you will be at risk so

287
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,560
if you hear

288
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
if you walk through your server form and

289
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
you hear someone saying so this is the

290
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,120
part

291
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
the heart of our project often with a

292
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
proud intonation to it

293
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
then that is a risk if you feel

294
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,640
that or if you hear that you hear

295
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,760
someone saying

296
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
the data will be provided by the system

297
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
or well the communication is going to be

298
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
handled by the system

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
or even another common heard phrase

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
this server or service will always be

301
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
online except when being maintained

302
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
then you have to be aware that these may

303
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
be risks because these are sentences

304
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
pointing to single points of failure in

305
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
your infrastructure and you need to

306
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
handle those

307
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
so thank you very much for the attention

308
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
thank you very much got some good notes

309
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
thank you very much kim yes you brought

310
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
forth some very interesting points and

311
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
and very interesting presentation in

312
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
general

313
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
i can see that we did not yet receive

314
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
any listener questions but

315
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
i'm sure we will receive some until the

316
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
discussion but

317
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
in the meantime i have a question to you

318
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
it's concerning the paper

319
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,560
so in the additional measures to improve

320
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,519
resilience

321
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
you describe preparations and practices

322
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
by western governments

323
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
and armed forces to operate in an

324
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,000
environment where

325
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
communication services are unavailable

326
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
and you talk about regular exercises of

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
alternative means for distributing

328
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
public information

329
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,839
so how could such exercises look like in

330
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,040
practice

331
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,279
so in practice basically what we are

332
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,880
saying with that statement

333
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
is that we need to get back to a way of

334
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
communicating that is not

335
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
utterly dependent on telecommunications

336
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,320
to work

337
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
first of all so looking back prior to

338
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
the whole cyber area

339
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
we have been able to communicate before

340
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,760
that

341
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,320
excuse me and so we need to

342
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
learn ways of communicating we also need

343
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
to

344
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
establish ways of communicating that are

345
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,639
not dependent on external services

346
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
and the sort of public information you

347
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
are talking about here is this

348
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
government to citizens or rather

349
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
government bodies to government bodies

350
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,518
in case of a crisis

351
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,200
actually both so actually both

352
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
because obviously if you need to uphold

353
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,279
communication between government to

354
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,480
government

355
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,760
um then that is going to be affected

356
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
during a crisis

357
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
so you will need to train and establish

358
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,079
ways to communicate

359
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
from government to government the same

360
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
as government to citizens

361
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
okay well thank you kim for your

362
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,600
presentations and your replies and

363
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
now we will move on to the second

364
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
presentation by james shires

365
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,639
james you wrote a paper with the

366
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
beautiful title windmills of the mind

367
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,880
higher order forms of disinformation in

368
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
internal politics

369
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
discussing the separation of first order

370
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
forms of disinformation from higher

371
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
order forms of disinformation

372
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
i'm looking forward to hear more about

373
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
this please james stage is yours

374
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,760
thanks very much uh philip for hosting

375
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,639
this session

376
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,079
and thanks also to the cycon organizers

377
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,760
for putting together such a wonderful

378
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,240
program i'm really honored to be part of

379
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,720
this

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
excellent panel and i'm looking forward

381
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
to the discussion and the other

382
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
presentations

383
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,959
um thanks also for the audience and

384
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
please do submit questions

385
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
uh whenever you can so in my paper i'll

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
talk a little bit about this

387
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,199
um not too much detail just to give you

388
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:49,680
a quick

389
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,279
overview and then we can get into the

390
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
discussion later on

391
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
as philip said it's titled uh wimbledon

392
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,160
of the mind

393
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
we can ignore that bit it's mainly

394
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
focused on what i term

395
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,399
higher orders of disinformation uh

396
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
for that those who whom that is a bit

397
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,440
abstract

398
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
essentially as disinformation about

399
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
disinformation um this is an

400
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,920
increasingly

401
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
prevalent problem in international

402
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
politics

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
and is something that i think we need to

404
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
pay more attention to

405
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
i do so in the paper by sketching out

406
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,920
a real schism in approaches to thinking

407
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
about disinformation

408
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
most states and many other organizations

409
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
big social media companies

410
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,800
have all recognized the dangers of

411
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
disinformation in international politics

412
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
especially in pandemic times there are

413
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
risks that the online

414
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
public sphere could easily be swayed

415
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,680
or corrupted due to the prevalence

416
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,399
of misinformation and disinformation the

417
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
former being

418
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
unintentional and the latter being

419
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
deliberate

420
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
but just although many different states

421
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,680
and organizations have recognized this

422
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,480
importance

423
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
there are two very different ways to

424
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,320
tackle this problem

425
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
out there at the moment one focuses very

426
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,079
much on

427
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,040
fact checking on trying to ensure that

428
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,399
the quality of the information

429
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
in the public sphere is as good as

430
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
possible

431
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,959
more specifically it tries to remove

432
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
information that they feel is

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,880
disinformation it's deliberately fake

434
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,760
false or

435
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
misleading and we see this especially

436
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
in terms of pandemic use and

437
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
news around vaccinations and so on now

438
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,440
this is a very

439
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,759
micro form of intervention because it

440
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,480
tries to

441
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
tackle this information on the level of

442
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
the specific claim itself saying

443
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
this claim is false please remove this

444
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
claim whether you're doing that as a

445
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
state regulator

446
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
or you're doing it as a responsible

447
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,120
content moderator

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
or reason you're doing that as an ngo

449
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,160
right a

450
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,320
voluntary fact checking organization

451
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
that is trying to

452
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
improve the quality of debate in the

453
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,279
public sphere

454
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
that's one broad approach to tackling

455
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
this information in international

456
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
politics

457
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,480
now the other one isn't micro at all it

458
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,680
goes much more

459
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,120
macro and it says well it's not too

460
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
important

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
whether this information is true or

462
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,680
false what's more important

463
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,959
is the idea of influence and these this

464
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
really focuses on the deliberate kinds

465
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,079
of

466
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,240
of false and misleading information so

467
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
this is disinformation

468
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
rather than misinformation as a process

469
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,959
will

470
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,120
what we need to look at are especially

471
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
state-backed and state

472
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
directed influence campaigns deliberate

473
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
targeted efforts to shape public debate

474
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
towards

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,040
certain areas or away from others to the

476
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,839
advantage

477
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
of the act behind that campaign and

478
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,279
this approach to disinformation

479
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,600
has a long history like the idea of

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
propaganda

481
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
of uh influence campaigns of what thomas

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
red calls

483
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,399
active measures you know goes far beyond

484
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,320
the current online information

485
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
environment it's a technique of

486
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,160
statecraft and international politics

487
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
that has been used for decades if not

488
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,880
centuries so we have these two really

489
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,959
different ideas about how to tackle how

490
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,919
to view

491
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,240
the problem of disinformation one micro

492
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,199
focusing on

493
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,160
fact checking trying to uh disprove

494
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,199
specific claims

495
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,480
the other one's saying you need to look

496
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,559
at influence campaigns

497
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,480
not on specific claims but maybe on

498
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
networks of what facebook

499
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,520
calls coordinated inauthentic behavior

500
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
and these are actors moving together

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
trying

502
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
to shape the debate trying to influence

503
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,160
audiences

504
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
in certain ways what i

505
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
want to say is maybe we can connect

506
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,120
these two

507
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,280
different approaches uh by thinking

508
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
about disinformation about

509
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
disinformation

510
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
by thinking about the connections

511
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
between different

512
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
contested and disputed claims uh that

513
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
are out there

514
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
in international fora and this is

515
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,799
because both

516
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,440
aren't quite satisfactory as a solution

517
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
right if you look at the micro level

518
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
then the problem is that as soon as you

519
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,559
try and get into

520
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
disproving fat checking claims

521
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,600
especially ones

522
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
that are highly particularly politically

523
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,360
charged

524
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
ones that have a lot of controversy

525
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,480
around them

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
that inevitably brings you in to

527
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,480
contesting narratives

528
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,600
right the idea that actually each claim

529
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
small facts are part of broader

530
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
narratives and they can't be judged

531
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
as true or false except in the con in

532
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
their wider context

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,039
and so even when you see um a lot of eu

534
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,400
efforts to try and

535
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
do fact checking at a very individual

536
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,000
level

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
they often get drawn into these broader

538
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
narrative contexts

539
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
and those narrative contents are exactly

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,440
what the idea of influence campaigns

541
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
tries to address when i try to look at

542
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
these

543
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
state directed or often with commercial

544
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
intermediaries

545
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
in between uh ideas trying to shape the

546
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,400
international

547
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,039
debate um but that also is

548
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,480
unsatisfactory

549
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
because it doesn't address the reason

550
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,600
everyone's looking at disinformation

551
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
overall

552
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
is that people feel it is significantly

553
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
different to broader forms of

554
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
influence in their media more generally

555
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,679
right there is no

556
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,840
uh non-biased completely neutral media

557
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,120
out there so

558
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,559
some of it is worse than others one of

559
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,240
the reasons we think that is worse is

560
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,799
because

561
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
it is false or especially misleading

562
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,000
right so this idea of influence

563
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,559
campaigns

564
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
doesn't quite catch the heart of the

565
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,840
problem the reason why we're all

566
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,720
motivated

567
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
to solve it in the first place and what

568
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
i say is well maybe we can

569
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
connect this micro in this macro view

570
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,320
from

571
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
specific facts to broader narrative

572
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
context

573
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
by thinking about the way in which

574
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
different

575
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,039
disinformation claims and discrimination

576
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,360
operations connect to each other

577
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
more specifically i say that we can

578
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
think about how they're reflective

579
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
and how they refer back to one another

580
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,200
so this can happen in two ways one is

581
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,600
that

582
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,280
they can build on one another so one of

583
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
the case studies i look at

584
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,919
in the paper is uh disinformation

585
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,039
around the classic case of the us

586
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,760
presidential elections in 2016.

587
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,600
here i show how you have different

588
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
claims stacking on top of each other

589
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
one intelligence assessment leading to

590
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,039
another intelligence assessment leading

591
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,600
to

592
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
a public dossier leading to a claim by a

593
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,679
particular government official

594
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,679
all referencing back to each other now

595
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,799
for those who see these as

596
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,919
disinformation

597
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,960
this is growing and it's moving from a

598
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
specific false claim

599
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
that you can fat check towards what

600
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
becomes an overall narrative

601
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,720
right a network or a stack of claims

602
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,159
that all fit together

603
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
in a neat story we can also see

604
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
higher orders of disinformation all

605
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
these connections between

606
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
forms of defamation in terms of

607
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
contesting as well

608
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,679
and this is something we increasingly

609
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,760
see in the policy domain at the moment

610
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
you see uh accusation of a

611
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,120
disinformation campaign

612
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
especially towards the state being

613
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,320
responded to by saying well that

614
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,120
accusation

615
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
itself is disinformation right this

616
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,640
occurs

617
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
in terms of saudi arabia saudi arabia

618
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,679
and

619
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
report that was published by the us

620
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,159
quite recently it occurs in terms of

621
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,280
the uk and uh bbc's investigation

622
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,080
into human rights uh abuses and

623
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
mistreatment of august

624
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
in xinjiang in china and the chinese

625
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
response to that investigation

626
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
here you have this disinformation claims

627
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
referencing back

628
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
to previous disinformation claims and

629
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
even back to previous ones

630
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
and so on all the way down right in here

631
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
they are still building on top of each

632
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
other but in a contested

633
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,159
rather than a um connected way by rather

634
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
stacking on top of each other what i say

635
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
is that this is a really important

636
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
uh problem to deal with in international

637
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,880
politics

638
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,320
because we have to think about it both

639
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,360
defensively in terms of connecting

640
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,400
narrative kinds of defense against um

641
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
and with fat checking kinds of defense

642
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,679
but also

643
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
as you increasingly see with many states

644
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
they're considering offensive responses

645
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
to disinformation

646
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
trying to do counter disinformation

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
campaigns and

648
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the risk is that those will get caught

649
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
up in these broader narratives

650
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
so we have both defensive and offensive

651
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
policy implications

652
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
and i recommend you check out the paper

653
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
for more detail thanks very much philip

654
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
back to you thank you very much james

655
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
and when you explain it like this it

656
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
doesn't sound as complicated

657
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
so i'm very happy that we have a

658
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
audience question and i will read it to

659
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
you

660
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
how emerging and disruptive technologies

661
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,679
edts

662
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,840
are being used as part of these

663
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,960
disinformation misinformation campaigns

664
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
how edt's can be better leveraged to

665
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,159
address those campaigns

666
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
through the use of ai so i think this is

667
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,760
a technology as

668
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080
a technology question

669
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,159
it's a good one as well um so thanks

670
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,280
very much for the question

671
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,720
uh the short answer is that

672
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,760
um emerging technologies are

673
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
very closely connected with forms of

674
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
disinformation and influence campaigns

675
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,039
the idea is that the actor behind

676
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
a deliberate influence campaign wants to

677
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
make it as efficient

678
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,400
and as effective as possible and so

679
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
they will do as much as they can to

680
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
achieve those goals

681
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,320
now um efficient efficiency and

682
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
effectiveness

683
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,919
are both provided by online social media

684
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
platforms they have a table for example

685
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
micro targeting as specific audience

686
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,039
segments

687
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,559
they make things much cheaper you don't

688
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
have to invest a lot of time and

689
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
resources

690
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
in terms of generating the content

691
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
themselves these are all emerging

692
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,440
technologies

693
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
and one of the ways that we see this

694
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,200
developing in future

695
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,159
is definitely in terms of automation and

696
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:48,960
trying to

697
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
use natural language processing to

698
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,159
generate content itself

699
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,640
make that even more efficient even more

700
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
cost effective

701
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,880
but also to maybe try and alter and

702
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
disinformation claims

703
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
depending on their responses from

704
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
particular audience segments so again to

705
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
try and get the targeting

706
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,360
automated as well now it's a big open

707
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,640
question about whether

708
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,679
you can develop uh forms of ai or

709
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,760
algorithm-based detection against this

710
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,120
information that are

711
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
effective that are reliable and there's

712
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
a lot of research and investment going

713
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
into that area

714
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
right now so that's a big open question

715
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
definitely something worth pursuing

716
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,799
and we can see that happening more in

717
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,320
the future

718
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
thank you very much i'll immediately

719
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,600
address our sect

720
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,640
second audience question is there any

721
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
hope of using public debate

722
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
to throw light on the competing

723
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,080
narratives in a useful way

724
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,440
definitely so i think they are uh

725
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
these competing narratives stand and

726
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,559
fall very much

727
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,400
in the public debate right the idea of

728
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,240
influence campaigns is that they are out

729
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,640
there

730
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
influencing the public this means that

731
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,559
we can study them

732
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,039
right because they are out there um but

733
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,000
it also means

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
that uh when you're looking at the

735
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,200
public debate you have to really take it

736
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
into account where it's happening so the

737
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,960
tendency of a lot of

738
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
researchers to say well maybe the public

739
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
to pay is a debate on twitter

740
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,679
right or it's a debate on facebook this

741
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,440
is a very platform-based

742
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,760
current sort of approach to thinking

743
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
about where the debate is

744
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
actually what i would really encourage

745
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
um is cross-platform approaches right

746
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
looking at where

747
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
um debates are happening simultaneously

748
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,440
across platforms

749
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
but also where they shift right and we

750
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,799
see this a lot um

751
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,840
with more proactive platform responses

752
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,279
to implement campaigns in the last

753
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,440
couple of years where you have

754
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
uh debates uh going from maybe more

755
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
public forums

756
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
more public platforms to more private

757
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
channels as well

758
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
so i agree that public debate is the

759
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,679
core of the problem

760
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
but actually getting into how part of

761
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,440
that debate is where it really happens

762
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
really gets us into the heart of the

763
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
current trends in disinformation

764
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,200
operations

765
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
thank you very much james i see that now

766
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,039
we are receiving a couple more questions

767
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
but we have to move on we will try to

768
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,480
address them during the discussion later

769
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,159
on

770
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,840
we will now move on to the last

771
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
presentation of this session by neil

772
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,799
kushwaha

773
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,799
neil's intriguing paper with the title

774
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,919
cyberpersonhood

775
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
lays out the concept of legal personhood

776
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
and how and why it could be applied to

777
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
cyberspace

778
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,120
neil please the floor seals

779
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,960
thank you phil um i must first

780
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880

co-authors for their contribution to

782
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,600
this paper

783

uh thank you very much to kier tasiro

784
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,919

787
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,960
a seat next to you

788
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
on this on this session well i still

789
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
also like to take a quick moment to

790
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,000
thank the

791
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,799
cycon ccdcoe team the peer reviewers the

792
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,080
audio visual team

793
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
and and many more for their hard working

794
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,760
efforts

795
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,919
making this experience from yesterday

796
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,679
into the next few days a complete

797
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,039
success

798
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,960
i'm in ottawa and while we're still

799
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
under uh relatively strict lockdown

800
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
measures i haven't had a haircut

801
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
in uh in about six months

802
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
and uh this 1980s hair that i'm

803
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
stuck with is forever on on record in

804
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,919
this video

805
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,960
so i hope it brings a smile on your face

806
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,279
uh i'm missing talon and the enthusiasm

807
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,000
among the

808
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
delegates the icebreaker the conference

809
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
dinners the mixers and the general

810
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,120
hospitality

811
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,440
i hope we can reconvene in person soon

812
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,799
so all that um

813
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,919
i'm going to take a bit of a different

814
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
approach for this talk i realize that

815
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
the term cyber personhood is

816
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,960
unique and and can easily

817
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
result in a conflicting discussion at

818
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,240
the legal policy and technology levels

819
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
my work covers all these areas so to

820
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
help explain the concept i'm going to

821
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,039
bring you back

822
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,559
to where i was when i thought of it

823
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,120
early june 2017 i was on my way back

824
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
from cycons defending the core

825
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,240
and terms like a cyber attack and cyber

826
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
as a domain of warfare were ringing in

827
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,039
my head

828
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,520
and i walked away thinking about their

829
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,399
definitions

830
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,760
lexicon taxonomy with a with a legal

831
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
perspective

832
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
then back in canada on the 10th of

833
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,720
october i was listening to

834
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
the canadian broadcasting corporation

835
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
our cbc radio program where an

836
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,760
interviewer named

837
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
anne maria tremonti was interviewing

838
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
david boyd an

839
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
environmental lawyer they were

840
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,159
discussing this

841
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,320
his new book then new book at least

842
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
called the rights of nature

843
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
and listening to the interview jumbled

844
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,840
more thoughts into my mind and i began

845
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
to think

846
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
what if someday in the future really

847
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,760
complex cyber systems

848
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,640
complex cyber systems are also granted

849
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,200
cyber

850
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,799
personhood rights then if

851
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,200
we were to be attacked we could

852
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,640
legitimately call them

853
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
cyber attacks well that radio program

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,919
was the germination of this paper i

855
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
jotted some notes down under the term

856
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,960
cyber and biomimicry and

857
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,600
between then now this this paper has

858
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,559
come out

859
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,240
so from 2017 i need you to think very

860
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,559
far

861
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,240
forward to help explain this thought and

862
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
avoid applying this concept uh to

863
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
anything i'm about to share

864
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,919
to anything that you're able to touch

865
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,679
today so i think

866
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
very far into the future think of a very

867
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,000
highly interdependent cyber system in

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
the near future

869
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,360
imagine things like fully autonomous

870
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
vehicles without steering wheels

871
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
interconnected with each other from

872
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,840
varying

873
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,279
manufacturers and systems that are

874
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,799
critically dependent on

875
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
time signals not only waking you up in

876
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,399
the morning but also

877
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,080
maintaining your digital identity and

878
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
encryption for connecting you to common

879
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
services

880
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,919
in cyberspace think of the blurred roles

881
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,279
and responsibilities of such a system

882
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,039
think even further into the future and

883
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,600
consider how societies may rely on cyber

884
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
systems

885
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,799
based on emergent phenomena and

886
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
complexity theory systems

887
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,279
or physical systems managed entirely by

888
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,720
ai

889
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,039
now consider several of such future

890
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,039
systems being highly interdependent on

891
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,159
each other

892
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,640
they are consuming and feeding each

893
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
other's data

894
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,640
and have deeply nested computing

895
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,480
parts are run by governments while some

896
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
parts are run by corporations

897
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,080
with very blurred lines of

898
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
responsibility

899
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,000
which you hopefully have in your mind

900
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
right now is what we refer to as

901
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,799
a highly interdependent cyber system

902
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,440
not widely accepted some states such as

903
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,559
bangladesh

904
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,120
bolivia colombia ecuador india and new

905
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,760
zealand

906
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
have enacted laws to support

907
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
environmental personhood

908
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,480
leading the charge was ecuador in 2008

909
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,440
but it all started

910
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,679
36 years before that with chris stone's

911
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,880
1972 legal paper

912
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
should trees have standing stones paper

913
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,840
referred back to a time when rights for

914
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,480
corporations women and others were

915
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,519
unthinkable

916
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,640
he described that today children and

917
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,519
inmates have

918
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,360
limited rights he went on to describe

919
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
environmental rights

920
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,799
their liabilities it was a very

921
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,080
interesting paper

922
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
and indeed controversial back in 1972

923
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
without getting into the details in a

924
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,679
very few minutes of an introduction for

925
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,799
our paper

926
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,360
we had similar thoughts as stone that

927
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,519
someday

928
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,159
in the future some states may adopt the

929
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,120
legal person

930
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,399
a legal position of cyber personhood but

931
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,840
only for a highly interdependent cyber

932
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,279
system our paper describes scenarios

933
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,240
where it would

934
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,799
not apply at all and scenarios where it

935
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,480
would most likely apply

936
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
we also discussed some policy and legal

937
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,760
matters to help under

938
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,799
understand how states may one handle

939
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,360
injuries impacting the system along with

940
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
injuries caused by the system

941
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,640
uh two may claim states may claim

942
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
cyber attack outside of armed conflict

943
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
impacting

944
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
the state in conflict along with

945
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,480
states not in conflict but reliant on

946
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:16,799
the

947
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,360
highly interdependent cyber system we

948
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,039
also discuss how states may

949
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,919
manage cyber attack under armed conflict

950
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,360
furthermore we get in obligations

951
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
liabilities representation and

952
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
guardianship we believe one of the

953
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,760
values of the paper is to pre-think the

954
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,600
concept of cyber personhood

955
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
in a future where systems are so

956
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,200
interdependent

957
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
that their loss of service would impact

958
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,480
our daily life

959
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,880
our state's economic stability possibly

960
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
international agreements and more

961
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,399
we believe the concept of cyber

962
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,240
personhood deserves discussion

963
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,960
especially since tools to govern it are

964
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
already available

965
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
for us the question remain the questions

966
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,080
remain actually

967
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,600
uh which cyber systems will develop

968
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,240
the criticality and complexity deemed

969
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,880
worthy

970
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
of being governed under international

971
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
law and

972
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,799
which countries are bold enough to make

973
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
this concept a reality

974
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,880
under their respective domestic laws

975
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
thank you very much

976
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,080
and once again i'd like to thank the

977
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,440
ccdcoe team

978
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,640
and the entire team of this cycon

979
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,320
event for this opportunity

980
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,240
thank you very much neil we appreciate

981
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
it and

982
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
we appreciate having all three of you

983
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,799
here you are so to say veterans of cycon

984
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
so neil one thing that i was wondering

985
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
about cyber

986
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
personhood is would giving personhood to

987
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
a cyber system

988
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,440
remove the responsibility from creators

989
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,799
and operators of systems

990
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
yeah that's a good question and and

991
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,760
that's um something we debated as well

992
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,960
these concept of uh the responsibility

993
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,880
if you can tie that responsibility back

994
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,919
to a company

995
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
or an organization government that maybe

996
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,960
even or

997
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,559
an alliance it's

998
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,960
probably not a great candidate for this

999
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
concept of cyber personhood

1000
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,280
and i think the challenge is when

1001
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,639
they're very very

1002
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,239
tightly coupled and um our idea of that

1003
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,639
and

1004
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,480
maybe a reasonable explanation of that

1005
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
we see we see software systems

1006
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,639
and and hardware coupled system software

1007
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,320
systems being written

1008
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,800
and developed in in very quick

1009
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,839
turnaround

1010
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,040
possibly one would say poorly written

1011
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,800
and uh and then they intertwine with

1012
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,119
other systems data feed from here data

1013
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,239
feed from there

1014
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
and uh and back and forth feeding each

1015
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,918
other and when that starts to happen

1016
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,760
it's really difficult to ascertain

1017
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,480
exactly what went wrong and how it went

1018
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
wrong

1019
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,480
and um it can take a lot of time

1020
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
as to just bringing it back online and

1021
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,359
that we face some of that today

1022
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
i'm looking extremely forward in an

1023
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
environment where we can't really pick

1024
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,920
on

1025
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,079
this company being responsible or that

1026
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,480
government being responsible

1027
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,040
and so those those scenarios where you

1028
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,680
where that

1029
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
interdependency is extremely high is

1030
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,960
where cyber personhood may apply

1031
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
so your question relating to you know is

1032
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
it you know could we not pin a company

1033
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
on it could we not pin

1034
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
the responsibility of a service provider

1035
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,359
on it could not pin the government on

1036
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,079
this thing

1037
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,200
could they not be responsible um

1038
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
i would i would urge anybody thinking

1039
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
that way to to kind of

1040
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,079
relieve themselves from that and think

1041
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,160
even further forward and very coupled

1042
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,599
systems

1043
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,400
yeah hopefully that answers the thought

1044
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,119
there phil

1045
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,760
yeah thank you very much and i think we

1046
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,359
i see that we received a lot of

1047
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,760
questions actually and i think

1048
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,119
that many questions will be uh also

1049
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,240
concerning cyber personhood which is

1050
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,280
a very polarizing topic i guess so

1051
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
i suggest we move on to the discussion

1052
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
part now so

1053
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,320
we can address a few um audience

1054
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,040
questions and

1055
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
and maybe also questions from the panel

1056
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,079
itself so

1057
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,200
raise your hand if you want to say

1058
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
something i'll start with the first

1059
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
question that i received here for kim

1060
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,480
and it's a very long one part of the

1061
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
problem with addressing the nexus of

1062
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,800
cyber and physical vulnerability

1063
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
is mutually exclusive mandates by

1064
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,079
different security entities

1065
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,520
how should this challenge be best

1066
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,240
overcome to address vulnerabilities that

1067
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,720
lie at the nexus of interdependency

1068
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
of cyber and physical risks how should

1069
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
organizations

1070
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
commercial or state best organize these

1071
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,359
challenges it was a very long one kim i

1072
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,640
hope you

1073
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,760
you could get the essence of it yes uh

1074
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,119
thank you very much for the question

1075
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
it's a it's a long one it's a complex

1076
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,160
one but it's also a good one so thank

1077
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,200
you very much

1078
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,240
um so basically the question is as i get

1079
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,040
it asking

1080
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,320
what is what can we do to actually

1081
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,079
handle the vulnerabilities that we

1082
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,880
experience

1083
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,839
especially being very intertwined or

1084
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,680
having very intertwined systems nowadays

1085
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,400
what i believe one of the things that i

1086
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
tried to address during the talk

1087
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,560
although just done very briefly is that

1088
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
we need to

1089
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,520
one find other means of communication

1090
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
that we can rely on

1091
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,240
in case of crisis of emergencies and

1092
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,720
two with this communication that we have

1093
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
already we need to establish

1094
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,240
um valuable good redundancy and we need

1095
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
to maintain this redundancy

1096
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
so also adding on to the question you

1097
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,200
ask phil after the talk

1098
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,000
what we can do is to not just have

1099
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
residency in our television

1100
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,359
communication systems but also we need

1101
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,760
to test it we need to

1102
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
make sure that it is working when when

1103
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,200
talking about

1104
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,280
in technical terms about redundancy it's

1105
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
not just having another system somewhere

1106
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,079
in the place

1107
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,240
that you can just um boot when you need

1108
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,280
it but you

1109
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,079
also have to make sure that it's up and

1110
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,119
running it's

1111
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,520
up to date it's not being vulnerable

1112
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,480
itself

1113
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
it is that is that it is well

1114
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
interconnected with the existing system

1115
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,119
and that it actually works when the main

1116
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:11,680
system

1117
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,320
goes down that you relaunched your

1118
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,599
redundancy system

1119
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,160
so there are many many things to do i

1120
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,880
could get on

1121
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720
go on talking about this question for

1122
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
the next 10 or 15 minutes i don't want

1123
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,520
to do it

1124
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,000
but it's a good question and it's a long

1125
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,560
topic

1126
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,480
that needs addressing so basically

1127
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,320
what you should do is to get your

1128
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
security manager to actually

1129
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,240
get to think about these kind of

1130
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,359
questions how can i install redundancy

1131
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,440
and technical means and ensure that it

1132
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
is being maintained and that is actually

1133
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,440
working in the case of an emergency and

1134
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,720
you need to train

1135
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,119
of course your personal also to to work

1136
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,480
with that situation in that case then

1137
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
thank you very much kim anybody else

1138
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,200
from the panel wants to reply as well

1139
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,119
or should i move on to the next one all

1140
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
right so

1141
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,280
i'll read the next question are there

1142
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,680
any are there many recent examples of

1143
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,760
disinformation campaigns leading to a

1144
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
physical attack on critical

1145
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,440
telecoms infrastructure so burning of 5g

1146
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,000
masts for

1147
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,720
example i guess this is a question that

1148
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
uh

1149
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,800
combines uh james and and kim's topic a

1150
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,200
little bit

1151
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,280
yeah i can um start off with that that

1152
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,240
works uh

1153
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,640
i think the best one is the one the um

1154
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
the questions already identified right

1155
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,079
this idea of um

1156
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,200
5g uh being targeted uh because

1157
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,760
of uh misinformation around its

1158
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,560
connection

1159
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,800
to the pandemic um now

1160
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,280
the question there is really how far is

1161
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,800
this a misinformation or a

1162
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,079
disinformation

1163
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,119
uh campaign is this something like a

1164
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,920
conspiracy theory where it's emerging uh

1165
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
almost without

1166
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,400
a deliberate strategic intervention

1167
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,760
um or is there something more uh

1168
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
sort of strategic there some kind of

1169
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,800
intent there

1170
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,040
that makes it an influence campaign my

1171
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,720
reading of the current debate is a lot

1172
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,760
of this is um

1173
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,160
more towards the misinformation side so

1174
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,760
you have these people acting

1175
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,839
based on things that they've um uh read

1176
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,520
online but they're not sort of being

1177
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
directed to do so in a very sort of

1178
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,599
especially not in a state kind of way

1179
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,800
um but maybe you know there are there's

1180
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,319
stuff out there that prove me wrong

1181
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,040
um in terms of other forms of critical

1182
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,319
communications infrastructure

1183
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,400
i'd love to hear kim's thoughts on which

1184
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
ones might be most at risk

1185
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,119
from actors motivated maybe by

1186
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,079
malicious disinformation please kim

1187
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,880
okay it's a very interesting question um

1188
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,520
well

1189
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,640
i i think that basically almost any

1190
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,720
anything could be a target the question

1191
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
is of course and that's more your topic

1192
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,280
james

1193
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
um what type of disinformation can

1194
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,760
actually lead to

1195
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,319
get people into doing physical harm to

1196
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,520
an entity

1197
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
um so that is kind of the question

1198
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
taking from that side from so

1199
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
explicitly asking has there been a

1200
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,640
disinformation campaign

1201
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,440
that has led to physical damage of um

1202
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
for example telecommunication

1203
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,960
infrastructure or other infrastructure

1204
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
um one thing that i could think of um

1205
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,000
directly would for

1206
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
example be to install this trust in

1207
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
government's e-governance systems would

1208
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,839
be one thing

1209
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,440
i'm sure there's been many thoughts on

1210
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,119
this especially in estonia because i

1211
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
know you are one of the biggest

1212
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,359
e-governance systems users in europe at

1213
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,240
least

1214
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,280
um so if you were to install this trust

1215
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,359
among your your citizens into that

1216
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,040
system that would actually have quite

1217
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,720
tremendous effects first of all it would

1218
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,079
of course lead to

1219
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,440
um your and the civilians not using the

1220
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,839
system

1221
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,040
anymore but it might also also cause to

1222
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
more harmful effects

1223
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,119
in terms of actually trying to get the

1224
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,040
system down if you were to

1225
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,119
install for example a rumor that your

1226
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,440
government were to to sell

1227
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,720
personal data to foreign governance or

1228
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
or whatever if you were to install that

1229
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,800
type of distrust i can imagine that

1230
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
there would be an outrageous mass

1231
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,920
of people who would try to stop your the

1232
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,599
the government from doing that

1233
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,839
and in in those terms then could

1234
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,920
actually do or cause physical harm to

1235
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,480
the entity

1236
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,839
neil would you like to add something

1237
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,920
well that's a really difficult topic to

1238
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,520
discuss um

1239
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
you know we face uh we face that in

1240
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,880
discussions as well and

1241
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,800
um how how do you disassociate between

1242
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,720
this conspiracy theory versus the

1243
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,640
campaign itself is one part of that

1244
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,560
discussion that was touched upon

1245
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,280
and then the discussion of impact to cni

1246
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
i mean on the physical side can we can

1247
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
we turn those can one turn those

1248
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,839
information disinformation

1249
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,440
misinformation or even conspiracy

1250
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,119
theories into physical

1251
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
physical result and that's one of the

1252
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,440
biggest discussions on our entire cyber

1253
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,400
cyber sort of term of attack over the

1254
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,760
last few years can that

1255
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
become kinetic and uh yeah it's a great

1256
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,079
discussion topic

1257
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,000
so i'll leave that up to those uh who've

1258
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,680
done the study there

1259
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,880
all right thank you very much so let's

1260
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
move on to the next audience question

1261
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:18,800
and

1262
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
and i'm very happy to to report that we

1263
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,960
have a lot of audience questions and

1264
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
uh please keep them coming this is

1265
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,200
really nice

1266
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,760
so what are the factors that influence

1267
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
how powerful a certain narrative

1268
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,920
is and what structures where the state

1269
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,240
or otherwise have been most successful

1270
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,880
at generating these comparative

1271
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,839
advantages

1272
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,640
james i think this is a question for me

1273
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,720
as well yes

1274
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,359
yeah um clearly there's also different

1275
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,240
factors

1276
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,560
uh that really affect how powerful a

1277
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,000
certain narrative uh

1278
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,359
can be and these apply to both uh online

1279
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,560
and offline narratives right so now

1280
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
we're talking much more um

1281
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,800
about sort of you know this is uh media

1282
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,520
in general

1283
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,280
uh one is uh it's um

1284
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,920
sort of propagation by key figures you

1285
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,119
know by a certain

1286
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,760
influential they might be elites um you

1287
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,359
know you think about celebrities or

1288
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,359
politicians or particularly people that

1289
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,240
occupy

1290
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
um a lot of space in the public

1291
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,000
consciousness right so

1292
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,560
any kind of promotion there uh is really

1293
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,839
uh powerful in

1294
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,200
just getting the narrative out there um

1295
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,440
now you know this is why we have the

1296
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,960
concept of influences

1297
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,160
on social media and the idea that the

1298
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,800
the name influence is not without reason

1299
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,680
the idea is that they

1300
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,280
they are particular people who are able

1301
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,240
to influence a large number of others

1302
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
but focusing on particularly individuals

1303
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
or even particular organizations

1304
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,319
is only one half of the story and the

1305
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,280
danger there is

1306
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,720
it's too much of a supply-side

1307
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,280
idea of disinformation um rather than a

1308
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,800
demand side idea of different

1309
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,839
information as well

1310
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,680
so what we also need to think about are

1311
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,280
factors that

1312
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,640
make a particular narrative very

1313
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
powerful is because it fills a hole

1314
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
in people's understanding right it helps

1315
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,720
people explain

1316
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,440
a bit of the world that they don't have

1317
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,800
a good answer to

1318
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,079
for whatever reason um the world makes

1319
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:18,960
sense to them

1320
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,599
and that's very much the demand side

1321
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,800
kind of story

1322
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,880
um comes from we have to think about

1323
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,720
both sides here so this is both

1324
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,359
the um spread by particular individuals

1325
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,319
or campaigns

1326
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,640
but also the context in which it lands

1327
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,760
does it resonate

1328
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
with existing popular narratives does it

1329
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,119
use

1330
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,160
tropes or ideas that are already out

1331
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,599
there that brings them together that it

1332
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,480
reshapes them

1333
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,119
in a coherent format so you know there's

1334
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,319
a lot of different

1335
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
factors but i could separate them

1336
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,319
broadly into both supply and demand side

1337
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,720
and i'd say we have to think about both

1338
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
thank you very much

1339
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,640
i think we have sort of a follow-up

1340
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,839
question

1341
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,079
do you think ai and machine learning can

1342
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,000
be used to automate the aggregation of

1343
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,800
multiple

1344
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,040
weight sources to increase trust of the

1345
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,359
source

1346
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,079
so i guess the the person asking the

1347
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:10,720
question

1348
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,160
is asking how we can use machine

1349
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,880
learning and ai to enhance trust in

1350
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,440
in sources as opposed to watchdogs

1351
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,680
organizations or journalists

1352
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,520
or maybe combine it so i mean we could

1353
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,119
go we could go back to

1354
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,400
original you know attempt to

1355
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
enhance credibility and sources in

1356
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,280
intelligence agencies right and now

1357
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,000
we're going

1358
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,520
switching from media studies to

1359
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,359
intelligence history we can think about

1360
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,640
well let's do source

1361
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,280
ratings in terms of are they reliable

1362
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,800
and are they credible at the specific

1363
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,839
kinds of information

1364
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,599
they're delivering right these are very

1365
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,359
mechanical ways they work quantitative

1366
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,079
models

1367
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,119
um and clearly in intelligence analysis

1368
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:47,920
and assessment

1369
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,560
there's been far more uh resource

1370
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,960
devoted to thinking about how to judge

1371
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,400
credibility and reliability of

1372
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,160
information now the question was talking

1373
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,640
about

1374
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,040
can we automate this can we use ai or

1375
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,160
algorithmic ways

1376
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,280
of waiting far more uh ideas about

1377
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,359
whether a source is trustworthy or not

1378
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,480
the main question or sort of a big

1379
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,440
problem i think that would have to

1380
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,240
tackle

1381
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,560
is actually in terms of data labeling in

1382
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,520
the first place

1383
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,920
right in order to have um some kind of

1384
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,760
algorithmic training that does this

1385
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,400
you'd have to provide it with a data set

1386
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,599
that was

1387
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,480
uh reliably waited that you had um

1388
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,480
attachments to various credibilities

1389
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,040
there was you know a sort of archetype

1390
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,920
data set now

1391
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
that for me is something that probably

1392
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,520
doesn't exist right because of exactly

1393
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,640
what i was talking about in the paper

1394
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,800
in terms of connecting uh specific

1395
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,720
claims back to broader narratives right

1396
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,119
so

1397
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,079
i don't know if we can get that uh

1398
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,200
useful ground

1399
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,760
truth in algorithmic sentences in terms

1400
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,240
of

1401
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,440
labeling uh claims of trustworthy or not

1402
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,800
what is maybe a more useful way of

1403
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,040
thinking about it is looking at reaction

1404
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,040
by looking at how people treat

1405
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,079
particular claims

1406
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,599
and see what they um do in uh

1407
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,200
in terms of their reaction to it do they

1408
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,880
share it did they like it do they

1409
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,440
um ask their friends do they comment can

1410
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,000
you do top

1411
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
um sentiment analysis on the kinds of

1412
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,920
things they comment um so maybe you can

1413
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,359
automate that kind of

1414
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,119
uh detection mechanism through reactions

1415
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,640
rather than through trying to judge

1416
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,200
credibility of the content itself

1417
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,960
that makes sense and i was also thinking

1418
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,040
every system can be also used in for

1419
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,160
malicious purposes

1420
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,240
and and to spread at that point uh

1421
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
misinformation as well

1422
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,800
so instead of uh helping it would be

1423
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,760
it could be used the other way we have a

1424
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,520
question for neil

1425
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,680
isps struggle operationally and

1426
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,960
financially

1427
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,359
to be the regulators of its users while

1428
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
it's not completely restricting the use

1429
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
of internet service

1430
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
where should carriers throw the line

1431
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,359
yeah that's a that's an interesting

1432
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,920
thought too um so

1433
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,800
if we consider what uh what carriers do

1434
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,559
they offer a service and a very fixed

1435
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:01,119
service

1436
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,800
very distinct terms and

1437
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,880
you know very strict legal boundaries

1438
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,000
that we we have in states as well as in

1439
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,680
at a state level as well as at the

1440
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,280
contractual level between individuals

1441
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,520
and

1442
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,160
domestically as i mean internationally

1443
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,200
as well as domestically and

1444
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,160
i think that if the if the if that is

1445
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,720
well defined i think

1446
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,480
we have a we have a premise to carry

1447
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,000
upon that you know like we don't need to

1448
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,359
change that

1449
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,559
um i think the the the story behind what

1450
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,559
we are trying to describe is when it's

1451
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,480
really messy the lines are really not

1452
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,440
clear

1453
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
and and they're very difficult to to

1454
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,800
make clear

1455
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,839
so somebody brought this up earlier on

1456
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,760
in our discussion actually part of the

1457
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,319
part of the peer review process was that

1458
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,000
why couldn't we just pin it on a company

1459
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,680
why couldn't we just say hey this

1460
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
company is responsible or that

1461
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,640
government's responsible for site

1462
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,680
service

1463
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,800
and um and i think when i when i

1464
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,400
received that feedback i was

1465
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,160
i was faulting myself for not being able

1466
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
to describe the scenario well enough

1467
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,880
and the scenario well enough is that

1468
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,000
it's it's

1469
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,480
very difficult to ascertain who and

1470
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,240
where the responsibility may lie for

1471
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,559
such such a system and

1472
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,200
and that we also are very dependent on

1473
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,720
it in a sense that

1474
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
you know we're dependent on internet

1475
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,079
absolutely and communication services

1476
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,079
absolutely um cellular services and

1477
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,800
whatever not

1478
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,280
um and and our mobile devices and soon

1479
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,200
to be more and more dependent i'm sure

1480
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,680
um and that's not what i mean by it i

1481
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,240
mean

1482
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,040
that we don't function without it you

1483
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,319
know without a cell phone yeah i can

1484
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,280
function

1485
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,520
without uh an alarm clock i'll still

1486
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,040
wake up in the morning

1487
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
but if if certain things were extremely

1488
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,160
dependent on certain services such that

1489
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,119
they wouldn't even

1490
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,000
start in the day without those things

1491
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,760
without those connections or services or

1492
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,280
alarms or whatever they might be if you

1493
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,119
can think of

1494
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,920
at that point harming such a system

1495
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,559
could really impact your society

1496
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,160
and your economic capability within

1497
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,319
within that region or the state

1498
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,559
could be interdependent among multiple

1499
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,920
governments across multiple borders

1500
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
systems sharing across across the eu for

1501
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,520
example

1502
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,359
so that's kind of where i was leading

1503
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,040
that thought when you think of the

1504
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,440
internet service providers it doesn't

1505
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,839
i'm thinking yeah i think those those

1506
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:22,880
constructs are

1507
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
are well defined and can can continue to

1508
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,400
be used

1509
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,160
thank you very much we have another

1510
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,319
question concerning cyber personhood

1511
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,839
and this is a very interesting one and

1512
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,559
maybe i'm looking forward to hear

1513
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,119
your reply to this working on the

1514
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,200
presumption that a cyber personnel has

1515
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,040
to make decisions

1516
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,960
how does a legal cyber personhood

1517
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,720
develop its own ethical point of view

1518
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,240
especially and in terms of law during

1519
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,720
armed conflict collision avoidance in

1520
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,759
autonomous vehicles

1521
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,440
yeah we we discussed that and it's a

1522
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,079
really

1523
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,319
complicated thought actually so what i'm

1524
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,240
digesting is the

1525
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,359
person that's asking the question and

1526
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,040
thank you for that question is saying

1527
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,359
that

1528
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,359
uh you know when when a systems becomes

1529
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,400
uh

1530
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
significantly autonomous or if not

1531
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,920
completely autonomous

1532
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,240
um whereby it's it's essentially

1533
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,720
rewriting its own algorithms and and

1534
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,319
that it was originally based upon and

1535
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,640
performing actions based on its newly

1536
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,400
written algorithms or

1537
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,240
revised over time and over time again

1538
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,760
and again algorithms

1539
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,800
and when it's used in or out of conflict

1540
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,359
how is that applicable um our paper gets

1541
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,640
into

1542
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,680
certain examples of of highly autonomous

1543
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,359
systems

1544
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,200
in these highly integrated systems and

1545
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,839
non-interdependent systems being

1546
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,000
discussed in this terms of when they're

1547
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,160
in law of armed conflict or inside a

1548
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
conflict situation so for example states

1549
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,280
are in conflict

1550
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
and that system is is critically

1551
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,040
dependent we didn't really tackle it in

1552
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,319
terms of

1553
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,839
it's performing an action in in conflict

1554
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,760
we looked at it from a perspective that

1555
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,240
citizens use it of the state or

1556
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,839
residents of the state use it

1557
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,480
and or states use it and let's say that

1558
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,599
system

1559
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,160
um is party to multiple states and one

1560
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,480
of those states goes into conflict

1561
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,720
and what is what is the responsibility

1562
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,319
and how does that apply

1563
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,119
among among the parties that are using

1564
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:21,440
that

1565
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,280
that system we discussed it from that

1566
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,920
perspective but the thought of of

1567
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,960
that particular system being used in

1568
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,760
conflict

1569
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,040
for conflict to support conflict um

1570
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,200
was not part of the uh part of our study

1571
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,960
sorry

1572
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,319
so that's a very interesting question

1573
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,400
indeed it is and maybe it's a topic for

1574
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,240
a follow-up paper

1575
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,720
yeah yes a very good point thank you for

1576
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,920
that

1577
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,880
so we are receiving many many questions

1578
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,280
and

1579
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
thank you a lot to the audience for that

1580
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,119
i'll address the next one

1581
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,119
we have seen so many successful attacks

1582
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,480
on critical infrastructure

1583
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,960
now during peacetime that i have to ask

1584
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,839
myself

1585
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,520
how can we achieve a good level of

1586
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,440
security in case of wartime

1587
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,400
is this even achievable so i think kim

1588
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
this is a question targeted towards you

1589
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,319
but

1590
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,520
maybe neil you want to add something

1591
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,839
afterwards

1592
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,440
james is welcome yes

1593
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,359
please you're all welcome to to jump in

1594
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,880
on that question because i think it's a

1595
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,119
that's very interesting topic

1596
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,400
of course yes it's a

1597
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,119
it's absolutely valid to ask if we are

1598
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,720
already experiencing

1599
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,440
um so many attacks against critical

1600
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,480
infrastructure which

1601
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,520
now going to back a little bit um

1602
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,799
we have to know that critical

1603
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,480
infrastructure is in most european

1604
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,119
countries

1605
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,119
infrastructure that is by some means

1606
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,559
additionally protected

1607
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,960
so most countries are aware of their

1608
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,160
critical infrastructure

1609
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,880
being critical as the word says and so

1610
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,920
they are trying

1611
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,480
to actually establish better security

1612
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,000
mechanisms within those

1613
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,359
um and within those infrastructures

1614
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,640
unfortunately it doesn't always work out

1615
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,520
so um it's absolutely legitimate

1616
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,960
legitimate to ask

1617
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,799
well if this is already happening during

1618
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,119
peace time

1619
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,359
what will actually happen if we are in a

1620
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,040
real cyber conflict or in a

1621
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,200
at war time um and the question whether

1622
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
it will actually be able or we will be

1623
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,480
able to

1624
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,480
truly achieve some some level of

1625
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,400
security that is

1626
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
that is allowing us to to uphold

1627
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,760
our lives even during such a time

1628
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,799
i would like to say yes i still think

1629
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,480
we can reach a level of security where

1630
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,720
we can at least uphold our daily

1631
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,920
lives and we can at least uphold

1632
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,640
the critical infrastructure to a level

1633
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,079
that allows us to to go

1634
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,200
on um even during a conflict but we are

1635
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,000
not theirs

1636
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,119
yet and one way would of course be again

1637
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,319
redundancy um i i feel a bit

1638
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,200
silly to actually reiterate redundancy

1639
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,000
all the time because

1640
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,760
it's been such a very basic concept um

1641
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,680
during in computer science back in the

1642
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,520
days in the 90s and

1643
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,000
even through the early 2000s but

1644
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,359
unfortunately it seems to be something

1645
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,880
that has been lost

1646
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,400
and but as i said redundancy is not

1647
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,960
equal to redundancy so redundancy

1648
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,440
that is put into the same building if

1649
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,200
you have a server that is situated in

1650
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
the same building as the main server and

1651
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,160
you call that

1652
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,079
having redundancy then no you're not

1653
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,839
doing redundancy you're not doing it in

1654
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:32,640
a good way

1655
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,240
if you have a redundant system that you

1656
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,000
have somewhere in

1657
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,680
in your basement and you never look at

1658
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,599
you don't take care of then that is not

1659
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,000
good redundancy either

1660
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
so i think we need to do many things to

1661
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,359
actually

1662
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,920
establish that level of security but i

1663
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,280
think it's something

1664
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,160
worth trying to get because it is or

1665
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
critical infrastructure

1666
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,400
and i think that we can do a lot better

1667
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,720
than we do nowadays

1668
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,000
thank you very much kim i saw some

1669
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,040
movement uh

1670
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,359
on james chair james did you want to add

1671
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,680
something

1672
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,599
no i think kim has pretty much covered

1673
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,160
it i think

1674
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,000
i would definitely uh emphasize

1675
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,520
redundancy uh

1676
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,799
i've done a lot of work myself on

1677
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,799
resilience and the question of you know

1678
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:19,520
how

1679
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,680
uh closely those two concepts are

1680
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,559
related

1681
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,040
uh i would just say that you know uh

1682
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,079
this uh

1683
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,680
divide between protecting critical

1684
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,520
infrastructure in

1685
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,559
peace time and in wartime maybe

1686
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,200
isn't as strong as you think right and

1687
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,040
then maybe the same things you should do

1688
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,559
peace on the same things you should do

1689
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,079
in wartime and actually what we're

1690
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,440
saying now especially in terms of the

1691
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,000
use of

1692
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,760
cyber operations is that um they are

1693
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,160
often used in this sort of gray zone in

1694
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,119
between the two

1695
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,799
right in sort of competitive state

1696
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,480
conflict that's below the threshold of

1697
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,119
war

1698
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,160
but not really um out of peace as well

1699
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:56,799
so

1700
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,880
um you know i would say there's probably

1701
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,000
more of a continuum

1702
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,920
and so you're seeing the same techniques

1703
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,079
the same uh philosophies and

1704
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,319
core concepts such as redundancy uh

1705
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,319
applying throughout these different

1706
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,799
contexts

1707
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,520
yeah i echo uh the comments made by uh

1708
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,720
i'm by uh kim and james as well um if i

1709
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,599
think about the

1710
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,160
uh the question itself and saying that

1711
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,720
is there

1712
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,359
a uh is there a sort of a protection or

1713
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,280
do we anticipate this being the same

1714
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,119
under under conflict or even worse under

1715
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,119
conflict i think um

1716
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,680
if we just consider certain things of uh

1717
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,720
you know

1718
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,680
critical infrastructure in itself if if

1719
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,760
it enjoys a very high standard of

1720
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,280
protection and even

1721
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,000
if you consider if it's used exclusively

1722
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,400
for

1723
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,079
civilian purposes it it's also qualified

1724
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,880
as a civilian object and therefore very

1725
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,839
highly protected

1726
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,040
under under conflict um i think the

1727
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,720
complexity would be and this kind of

1728
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,400
ties back to the previous question as

1729
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,920
well if i may is that

1730
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,280
if for example a party to

1731
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,040
a particular cni or or any system is

1732
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,480
really abused

1733
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,200
by or used and abused by a party another

1734
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,440
party for military purposes

1735
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,680
then that civilian object can be

1736
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,839
potentially considered a military

1737
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,680
objective and those kinds of things are

1738
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
really messy

1739
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,280
in terms of you know as it's described

1740
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,359
you know from a legal perspective versus

1741
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,400
when it's when it's actually uh when it

1742
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,760
actually plays out

1743
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,839
i think those are you know it's a it's a

1744
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,359
legitimate question to ask and

1745
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,760
i i don't have an answer i'm curious to

1746
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
see how states respond to that

1747
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,160
i think it's best way to say it thank

1748
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,520
you very much neil

1749
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,280
i see that we are getting more and more

1750
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,880
and more questions

1751
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,720
but sadly we are running out of time we

1752
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,240
have 15 seconds left

1753
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,599
in this panel um but uh to everybody

1754
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,200
that's asking questions now

1755
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,079
um you can read the full papers of our

1756
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,760
of our presenters here today in the

1757

cyclone proceedings so

1758
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,280
maybe you will find some answers there

1759
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,920
and i'm sure that

1760
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,680
