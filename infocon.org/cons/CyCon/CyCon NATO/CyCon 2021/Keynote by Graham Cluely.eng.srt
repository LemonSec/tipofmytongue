00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
up next is our final keynote

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,679
by security analyst graham clewley with

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,400
the title

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,240
not all cyber criminals are evil

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,480
geniuses please graeme the stage is

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
yours

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,698
[Music]

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,479
well thank you very much and hello hello

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,440
everybody

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
it's a real pleasure to be speaking at

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,760
the international conference on cyber

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,640
conflict

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,680
uh albeit virtually because well hey

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,079
you know what's going on but what an

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
interesting conference it's been

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
a tremendous array of knowledgeable

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,000
experts

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
speaking on a variety of topics we've

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
looked at the effects of leaks and

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
disinformation

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
through cyberspace attacks on telecoms

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,760
infrastructure

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,079
discussed international law the role of

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,840
artificial intelligence

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
the challenges of attribution and how we

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
might better protect

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
critical infrastructure as well few

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
quite a lot there

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,479
well there's no denying that cybercrime

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:14,960
is

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
a very serious subject and one that

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
impacts the lives

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
and livelihoods of many and when we hear

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
tales of state-sponsored cyber attacks

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
and the potential for enormous

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
disruption and harm

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,479
it's easy i think to find things a

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,320
little bit gloomy well

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,840
my job today is to reassure you

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
yes there are some very bad actors out

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,399
there and some have the resources and

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,280
the skills

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
to launch serious attacks but they're

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,759
very much at the top of the pyramid

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
the vast majority of attacks

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
uh attackers aren't on the payroll of a

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,399
foreign government

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
they aren't using sophisticated methods

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
to hack into companies and governments

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
in fact they're typically using tricks

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,680
that we've seen

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
a thousand times before perhaps using

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
simple social engineering techniques

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
to dupe someone into clicking on a link

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
run a malicious program

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
or hand over their password

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
and yet the media loves to portray

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
the typical cyber criminal as an evil

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
genius with a vast intellect

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,480
skulking in their laboratory on top of a

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
volcano

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
waiting to unleash their devastating

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
attack

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,599
on an unsuspecting world so my job today

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,480
is to say and to ask is that really the

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
case

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
because i've got a hunch that far from

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
being evil geniuses

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
most cyber criminals are actually just

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,519
as prone to making dumb

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
mistakes and poor decisions

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,040
as the next human being and in fact

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,879
they can be rather underwhelming and

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
dare i say unimpressive individuals

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
so why do i say that well let's take a

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,159
look at a hacking gang right now

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
a hacking gang that for a while captured

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
the media's attention

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
with its attacks on high profile targets

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,200
this

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
is lolsek all your baser belonged to

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
lolsek said their little meme like

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,760
nyan cat as it flew across the sky ten

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
years ago

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
in june 2011 british newspapers

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,480
were all talking about one thing

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
the arrest of what they called the

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
world's

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
number one hacker a teen

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
cyber mastermind well police in the uk

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,599
were reported to have swooped on the

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,400
home of this

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
quote global cyber villain don't you

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
love the british press

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
turned out he wasn't living in a volcano

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
after all

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
but instead inside a fairly regular

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,080
house

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
in essex here it is now one tabloid

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
newspaper

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
even managed to grab photographs

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
of the actual inside of the hacker's den

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
take a look at this

105
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,478
well it's instantly suspicious how do i

106
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,600
know that because he has

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,360
two monitors clearly the sign

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
of a hacking genius because what

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
possible reason

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
would anyone else have the need for two

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
screens

112
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
and what's that over the window his

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
window is covered

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
in tin foil perhaps to prevent

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
intelligent services from using top

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,320
secret

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
mission impossible style surveillance

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
technology to beam inside the mind of

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,759
the teenager

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
while he hacked from his bedroom

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
or perhaps like every other teenage boy

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
he just

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,759
isn't that keen on daylight

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,960
and they're saying i'll see the odd in

125
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
the room you can spot it it's an air

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,919
conditioning unit

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
in england nobody trust me i'm speaking

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
to you from england right now

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
no one has air conditioning in england

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,639
so it must be to cool down a

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
bitcoin mining rig or maybe there's some

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,199
more orthodox reason well hey

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,440
he is a teenage boy there could be all

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
kinds of noxious fumes and

135
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,759
unpleasant smells which he wishes to

136
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,880
release into the atmosphere

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919
rather than keep them inside stinking

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,479
out

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
his hacking den so the questions this

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,759
next question from the newspapers what

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
does this teenage

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
cyber terrorist look like well one

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
newspaper the daily mail no less

144
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
you can call that newspaper claimed to

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
have a world exclusive

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
a photograph of his face they bragged

147
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
sadly it wasn't a photograph not a

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
photograph of his current face

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
unfortunately

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
but a picture taken of him six years

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
earlier

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
when he was at school when he was aged

153
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
just 13. there you are the british press

154
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
so here's a picture of someone quite

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,600
some time ago when he was a kid

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
nonetheless the media went into a

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
complete frenzy they described

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,120
19 year old ryan cleary from essex

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
as nerdy a geek reclusive

160
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,240
and oddball and here's the thing

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
many young people really don't like

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
being called nerdy geeks

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
they certainly don't like being

164
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,759
described as oddballs

165
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
or portrayed as a little bit strange or

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
quote a bit

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
sad it doesn't fit well with their image

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
of themselves

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
as a hacking mastermind

170
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,440
and so the rest of the lulzek gang

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
they decided to take revenge

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
they targeted the sun newspaper which

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
had made fun

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
of ryan cleary by calling him all those

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,319
names they

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
changed the dns records of the sun

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
point in anyone who tried to reach the

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,680
sun's website

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
to a fake version of the site

180
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
and that version of the site had a bogus

181
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,319
story claiming that rupert murdoch

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
who of course is the owner of the sun

183
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
amongst many other things

184
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,599
had been found dead in his front garden

185
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,240
having stumbled over a shrubbery a

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,800
rather

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
ridiculous story obviously a joke but

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,479
still

189
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
embarrassing for the newspaper to be

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,479
hacked in that way

191
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
because they've made fun of this hacking

192
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
gang member but was this the work of

193
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
evil geniuses

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
i don't think so this was a hack which

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
exploited a simple

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
lack of security just like what

197
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
much of what lulzsec had been doing in

198
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
its hacking campaigns

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
when they were active 10 years ago

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
today some members of lolsick are

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
actually out there on the

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
the speaking circuit they're giving

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
talks about their hacks and about how

204
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,800
they were arrested

205
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,479
and some of them were given custodial

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
sentences as well uh they've become

207
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,639
notorious really sort of riles me in a

208
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,120
way

209
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,919
that the people who work hard in cyber

210
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
security the people who are defending

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,479
networks

212
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
don't get those kind of opportunities

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
and the people who've broken the law

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
sometimes uh end up being the ones who

215
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
applauded

216
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
well cleary was eventually found guilty

217
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
and he was jailed for two years and

218
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
eight months as an up-to-date photograph

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,479
of him

220
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,679
at the time of his sentencing so he was

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,760
sentenced for his involvement in lol

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
sex hacking spree but really

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
was he a cyber terrorist like the

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
newspaper said world's number one hacker

225
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,640
i

226
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
don't think so

227
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
he doesn't compare for instance with

228
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,120
this guy

229
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
let's take a look this is albert

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
gonzalez

231
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,440
he was the mastermind of the tj

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
maxx hack which stole 40 million credit

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
card details

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
and then a further 130 million credit

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
card details

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
from heartland payment systems now

237
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,399
you may be thinking that gonzales must

238
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,200
have been

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,720
some kind of amazing genius to steal

240
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
so many credit card details from major

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,920
companies like

242
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,040
tj maxx and others

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
but then when you read the incident

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
report

245
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,320
you find that this retailers

246
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
wireless network was protected using

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,440
wep encryption wep one of the weakest

248
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
forms of wi-fi security if you buy a

249
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
router today it won't even offer you

250
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
that level of insecurity you have to use

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,839
something better but

252
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
wep encryption can be cracked in as

253
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
little as three seconds

254
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
so it was a technology that was

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
considered obsolete as far back as the

256
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
early 2000s

257
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
but it was still present for gonzalez

258
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,160
and his gang

259
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,760
to exploit and they made cloned

260
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
payment cards from the stolen details

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
and they stole

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
a fortune from cash machines

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
but it's not as though they were being

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
careful not to be spotted

265
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
not to stand out in the crowd

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
albert gonzalez spent seventy five

267
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
thousand dollars on his birthday

268
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,959
celebrations

269
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,920
he had an accomplice who was seven feet

270
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
tall

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
just imagine that hanging out was a guy

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
who's seven feet tall you're going to

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
get spotted

274
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,959
he complained about having to count

275
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,200
340 000

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
by hand imagine that after his money

277
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
counting machine broke

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
it's one of the pains of being a

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
criminal is when you've got too much

280
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,839
money

281
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
the technology actually breaks down

282
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
making it harder for you to count how

283
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
much you've made

284
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
gonzalez's crime spree would have

285
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
continued

286
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
if he hadn't been caught at midnight one

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
night emptying an atm basically just

288
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
getting all the money out of it he was

289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,079
caught by a plane clothes policeman

290
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,480
and normally that would be bad news for

291
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,079
a hacker like gonzalez

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
but quite frankly i think it was a lucky

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
break for him

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,920
because gonzalez did a secret deal with

295
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
the fbi

296
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,640
he agreed to work undercover to build up

297
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
a network of contacts

298
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,880
that could then be nailed by the feds

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
gonzales agreed to help the fbi with

300
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
their plan

301
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
but in the meantime and this this is

302
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,480
what i find absolutely astonishing

303
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,760
what he and his crew of hackers did

304
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
was they kept on hacking they continued

305
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
to target businesses to steal they went

306
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,560
on to steal

307
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,240
a further 180 million

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,200
payment card details from a wide variety

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,440
of

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,639
organizations all

311
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
while working for the fbi at the same

312
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,800
time

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,079
it's quite astonishing that someone

314
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
who's working undercover continued

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,480
to hack and cause so and obviously

316
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
putting himself in huge

317
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,399
risk because it wasn't like that was

318
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,600
going to be taken well

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
he was already rich he just couldn't

320
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
bring himself to stop

321
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
gonzalez bought himself an expensive bmw

322
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,800
designer drugs he stayed in lavish

323
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
hotels

324
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
even hid 1.2 million us

325
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,079
dollars in cash in a barrel

326
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,839
in his parents home now understandably

327
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,079
the fbi didn't take kindly to this

328
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,920
they don't don't tend to like this kind

329
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
of thing and when they found out he had

330
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
carried on his lucrative

331
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
hacking business while he was supposed

332
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,399
to be helping them find criminals

333
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
um they obviously threw the book at him

334
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,639
and the judge

335
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,639
at his court hearing was not impressed

336
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
either gonzalez

337
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,200
was sentenced to 20 years in prison

338
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,480
so if you ask me was albert gonzalez a

339
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
genius

340
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
i'd say no a genius would have seen

341
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,200
that he'd been given a chance by the fbi

342
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
when he was caught when they said you've

343
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
got an opportunity here

344
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
to change things round he should have

345
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
done that he should have left it at that

346
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,760
and not hacked any longer

347
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,600
rather than risk his freedom again

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,399
well sometimes the bad guys aren't the

349
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
hackers sometimes it's the people who

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
are trying to recruit hackers to do

351
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
their dirty work for them

352
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
who are the ones we should worry about

353
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
this cheery looking chap

354
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,839
is zachary j landis from pennsylvania

355
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
united states of america now in 2015 he

356
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,639
had a problem

357
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
you see he was facing fines and court

358
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
costs totally in the grand sum of 16

359
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,360
000 after a series of past

360
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
criminal misdemeanors and crimes which

361
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,519
he had committed

362
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
and landis simply didn't have the money

363
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
to spare

364
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,560
so what did he decide to do

365
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,639
well he didn't have the skills to hack

366
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,160
so he did what he thought was the next

367
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
best thing he decided to hire a hacker

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
but if you don't know any hackers

369
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
where'd you hire one well landis thought

370
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
he had the perfect answer

371
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
to that he put an advert in craigslist

372
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,279
yes in a craigslist ad entitled am i kid

373
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
you not

374
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
can you hack and in that ad

375
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
he sought the help of anyone who could

376
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,600
hack

377
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
into the court's computer systems and

378
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
erase his debts remember he owed

379
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
thousands and thousands to the judicial

380
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,839
system

381
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
but past misdemeanors and fines

382
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,959
now perhaps unsurprisingly

383
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,160
the ad was supported by police uh who

384
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
then contacted landis posing as a hacker

385
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
they said oh yeah we can hack we can do

386
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
whatever you like we've got the

387
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,320
qualifications for the job

388
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
and landis replied and he shared with

389
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,720
them he even shared with them

390
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
the docket sheets from the three court

391
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,120
cases associated to the debt

392
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
debt that he wanted to raise

393
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
and at one point as landis negotiated

394
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
with the undercover cop

395
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
who was posing as a hacker he actually

396
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,759
sent police

397
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
a screenshot a screenshot of his

398
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,560
computer

399
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
so he pressed all print screen or

400
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,720
whatever it was sent them the image

401
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
and of course that has a wealth of

402
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,079
information

403
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
which the computer crime investigators

404
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
were able to to look into

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,279
unfortunately for landis he was logged

406
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
into his

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,959
gmail account at the time which helped

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
reveal his identity

409
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
and after the police contacted google

410
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
and craigslist

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,959
they found that the email address

412
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,040
belonged to landis and the advert

413
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
on craigslist had been made with his

414
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
account in his name it's like

415
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
dora wasn't that complicated

416
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
to prove that he really was the one

417
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
responsible

418
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
nowlandis was given plenty of time to

419
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
consider the stupidity of his actions

420
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
when he was handed a jail sentence of at

421
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
least 24 months

422
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
depending on his behavior it could be

423
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
more

424
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,920
no doubt landis is pretty disappointed

425
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
that it was the police who answered his

426
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
ad on craigslist rather than a genuine

427
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
hacker

428
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
but who do you complain to when you've

429
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,040
got a problem

430
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,600
like that you know we've all been in the

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,160
situation

432
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
haven't we i haven't put i haven't put

433
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,839
an ad in craigslist

434
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,599
saying hack you know i want to hire a

435
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,359
hacker but we've all been in a situation

436
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,919
where we've

437
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,760
wanted to make a complaint right we've

438
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,439
been unsatisfied we've

439
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,520
hit a brick wall sometimes

440
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
you have a problem and it's hard to get

441
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
a company's attention what do you do

442
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
what do you do when you can't get a a

443
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
proper response from a company

444
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,120
maybe you phone up the chief executive

445
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,400
officer

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
maybe you send a snotty email to their

447
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
customer service desk

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,799
maybe you pick it their head office

449
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
perhaps

450
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
or post something really on

451
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
twitter

452
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
what i hope you don't do is follow the

453
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
example of a 35 year old belgian

454
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,480
known only as brechtes

455
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
he was upset back in 2014 when a branch

456
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
of the creland bank

457
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
in a suburb of the city of rossler

458
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,880
his grumble with the bank occurred

459
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,039
because his parents had unfortunately

460
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
got divorced

461
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
and he felt that his mother's bank

462
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,679
account

463
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,840
had sustained losses of some

464
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,720
300 000 euros

465
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
and he thought that the bank officials

466
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
wouldn't meet with him to discuss the

467
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,840
matter

468
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
which wasn't making him very happy now i

469
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
don't have a photograph of brecht

470
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
so i've got this artist's impression of

471
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
what he looks like instead now

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,880
you might think that he might you know

473
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
if he was really really angry

474
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
maybe he would launch a distributed

475
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,760
denial of service attack a ddos attack

476
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
against the bank and if you thought that

477
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,440
you'd be right

478
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
that's exactly what he did he did launch

479
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,640
a ddos attack

480
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
and his cyber attacks took the bank's

481
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,000
portal down

482
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,919
for many hours on multiple occasions

483
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
now of course a ddos attack uses many

484
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,360
other people's computers compromised

485
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
computers

486
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
gets them to bombard a website with

487
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
traffic

488
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
so it wouldn't necessarily mean that it

489
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
was easy for the authorities

490
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
to identify brecht as

491
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,760
the culprit but

492
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
the next method he used to complain

493
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
about the poor customer service which he

494
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,080
claimed he had received

495
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
from this bank made him rather easier

496
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
to single out because brecht threw a

497
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,360
homemade

498
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,440
molotov cocktail at the bank branch

499
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
now i don't know if anyone in the

500
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
audience has ever fire bombed a building

501
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,200
i'd like to think that you haven't but

502
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
from what i understand

503
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
it's a good idea to be a good a fair

504
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
good distance away

505
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
from your target before throwing the

506
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,559
cocktail

507
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,360
at the burning cocktail um at your

508
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
target

509
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
so you need a good forceful chuck to lug

510
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,559
the fire bomb

511
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,320
a decent distance but

512
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,559
if you do give it the right amount of

513
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,120
welly if you give it some proper oomph

514
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
it does increase the chance that

515
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
something

516
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
might fall out of the back pocket

517
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
of your jeans like it did for brecht

518
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,640
in the form of a usb stick

519
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,440
and this us thumb b thumb drive which

520
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
fell out of his pocket

521
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,200
when he was throwing the molotov

522
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
cocktail

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,200
contained information which identified

524
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
him as the culprit

525
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,600
and led police to his door

526
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,799
and what the belgian cops discovered was

527
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,520
that the ddos attack against the bank

528
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,120
was not the only shady cyber activity

529
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,320
that brecht was engaged in

530
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
he also turned out to be a member of the

531
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,400
belgian chapter

532
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
of the anonymous collective the hacking

533
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
group

534
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,080
and he was also a member of another

535
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,000
hacking gang called the cyber crew that

536
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,120
had previously

537
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
engaged in attacks against fifa

538
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,799
in the run-up to the football world cup

539
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
and that's not all he'd done because

540
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
brecht had even launched

541
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,320
ddos attacks against a local pizza

542
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,919
parlor

543
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,600
after it made the mistake of putting

544
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
anchovies on a pizza his aunt margot had

545
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,240
ordered

546
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
and refusing to give his i don't

547
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
actually know if that is the real reason

548
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,320
i don't know if

549
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,080
they did deliver the wrong pizza but for

550
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
some reason he was so upset

551
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
with a local branch of his pizza parlor

552
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
he launched ddos attacks against them

553
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,840
i've

554
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320
i can't possibly explain the thinking of

555
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
some of these hackers

556
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
okay we have one final candidate

557
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
for the dumbest computer criminal of all

558
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,440
time

559
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
and it is this guy i wonder do you

560
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,679
remember

561
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,520
the syrian electronic army

562
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,159
between july 2013 and december 2014

563
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,640
the syrian electronic army a group of

564
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
pro-assad hackers

565
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
engaged in a criminal scheme what they

566
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
did was they hacked into the computer

567
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
systems of american and

568
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
other companies around the world they

569
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
stole information

570
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
and then attempted to extort large sums

571
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
of money basically

572
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
the kind of thing we're seeing more and

573
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
more now with ransomware where they're

574
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
threatening to release information

575
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
unless a big payment is made now

576
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,039
typically

577
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
the attackers from the syrian electronic

578
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,159
army would

579
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,640
begin with a carefully crafted phishing

580
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,840
email

581
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,320
designed to steal the login credentials

582
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
of an employee

583
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,960
at the targeted organization and if that

584
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,799
theft of a user's password was

585
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
successful the attackers would then use

586
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,919
those credentials

587
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,679
to access the businesses computer

588
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,120
systems we've had all this before

589
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,840
sometimes they'd compromise social media

590
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,480
accounts their device websites

591
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
they would meddle with dns records

592
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
or launch further vision attacks as well

593
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
victims of the syrian electronic army

594
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
include the international business times

595
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,360
forbes the guardian the telegraph

596
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,360
washington post amongst many others

597
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,400
now according to documents filed in a

598
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,799
u.s

599
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
court one member of the syrian

600
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
electronic army known

601
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
only online as the shadow don't you love

602
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
by the way the

603
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
the kind of names that hackers give each

604
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
other it's all sort of grandiose sort of

605
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,960
world wrestling names the shadow is said

606
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,799
to have demanded more than five hundred

607
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
thousand dollars from up to 14 victims

608
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
but the shadow at the syrian electronic

609
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,919
army

610
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,600
had a problem and the problem was this

611
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
he was based in syria

612
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,679
which meant that sanctions put in place

613
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,679
by the united states and other countries

614
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
prevented difficult you know presented

615
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
difficulties in transferring

616
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
funds to his bank account these were

617
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,279
really the days before

618
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,080
crypto currencies had taken off but no

619
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,279
matter

620
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,159
because the syrian electronic army said

621
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,640
it had intermediaries around the world

622
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
who could work as proxies here's an one

623
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
of the email communications

624
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,159
they had with one of their victims

625
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,840
what they did was they agreed how much

626
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,200
they were going to pay but they said all

627
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,559
you have to do

628
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,559
if you've fallen victim to an attack by

629
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,240
our group is contact

630
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
our intermediary in say germany and pay

631
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:27,919
them

632
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,840
instead and they will get the money to

633
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,960
us and so it was

634
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,000
that one u.s corporate victim was

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,799
directed

636
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,400
towards a gmail address

637
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
gmail address of someone who was

638
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,200
claiming to be in germany

639
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,120
pierre-omar.mail at gmail.com was the

640
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
email address

641
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,840
and the company which had been

642
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
victimized began to negotiate

643
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
and eventually they agreed on a sum of

644
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
money

645
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
that there was another spanner in the

646
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
works you see the

647
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
the legal department in the hacked

648
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,559
organization

649
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
wanted assurances that the hackers would

650
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,799
keep their word you know they say

651
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,640
they've stolen our data they say they

652
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,279
won't leak it how can we be sure of this

653
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,480
say the legal department what the legal

654
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
department says is

655
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,799
okay we'll pay the ransom but only

656
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
if the extortionists commit to never

657
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,720
releasing any of the data that they have

658
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,000
stolen

659
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
so what they wanted was they wanted them

660
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
to sign a contract

661
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
and they said just fill in this form get

662
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
this contract back to us

663
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
and then we will pay you however much

664
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
money which you want

665
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
all the legal department needed on the

666
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,559
contract was for the hackers to fill in

667
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,600
the bit of the form

668
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
bit of the contract which said name

669
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,799
address scan of passport

670
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,760
and that of course is exactly what the

671
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,799
hacker did

672
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,679
filled in the form with his real details

673
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,600
a real scan of his passport

674
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
which is why we know pierre-omar of the

675
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,039
syrian electronic army that really was

676
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
his real name and you can probably

677
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,480
imagine what happened to him next

678
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760
so when i hear stories like this it kind

679
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,640
of reminds me that well

680
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
not all criminals are evil geniuses

681
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,360
obviously there are sad and very capable

682
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
cyber criminals out there and we've been

683
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,480
talking about

684
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
the impact that some of those people

685
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
have been having on countries around the

686
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,720
world

687
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,640
during the course of this conference

688
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,200
but the sad truth is most cyber

689
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,159
criminals don't

690
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
have to be geniuses why should cyber

691
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
criminals use inventive methods and

692
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,320
exploit

693
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,960
zero-day vulnerabilities to hack into

694
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,919
companies

695
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,200
and governments when so often all they

696
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
need to do

697
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,360
is use tried and trusted techniques to

698
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,600
gain access

699
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,360
there's no need to find a

700
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,840
state-of-the-art brand new way

701
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
to hack into an organization if a simple

702
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,559
phishing attack works

703
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,840
or just a carefully crafted email using

704
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
social engineering tricks

705
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,480
manages to dupe an unsuspecting user

706
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,840
into clicking or running a malicious

707
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,399
file

708
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,960
so yes we need to be on our guard

709
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
against state-sponsored cyber criminals

710
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
who may have huge resources and funding

711
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
at their disposal

712
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
to break into sensitive systems and

713
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
critical infrastructure

714
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,039
but i think we should also recognize

715
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
that the vast majority of attacks

716
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
are using methods which are well known

717
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,559
which are proven to be possible

718
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
to harden defenses against by following

719
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,799
long-established best practices and

720
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,840
that's important

721
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,440
because many of our organizations

722
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,240
are reliant on suppliers and partners

723
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
and third parties

724
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,480
who you may not who may not consider

725
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
themselves the potential target of

726
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
state-sponsored attacks for instance

727
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,080
they may be vulnerable to very simple

728
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,120
attacks which

729
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,679
ultimately then lead to an attack

730
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,600
against critical organizations as well

731
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,399
sadly we aren't always able to rely upon

732
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
cyber criminals being as dumb as some of

733
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
the examples i've given you today but i

734
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,440
hope we can all agree

735
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
that not all cyber criminals are

736
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
geniuses in fact

737
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,279
i would go so far as to say that a lot

738
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
of the really smart work

739
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,640
is being done by members of the

740
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
legitimate cyber security industry

741
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
and those who work so hard to protect

742
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,480
our networks

743
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
and track down the cyber criminals who

744
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,600
seek into

745
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,840
hack into them thank you very much

746
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,100
indeed

747
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,659
[Music]

748
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
thank you graham for this exciting and

749
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,799
very enjoyable and

750
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,840
absolutely also very insightful talk we

751
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,039
would also have

752
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,520
actually a couple of questions from the

753
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,640
audience

754
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
the first one goes to what extent is

755
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
survivor bias in effect here

756
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,440
we catch these criminals because they

757
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
make stupid mistakes do we also catch

758
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
the smart ones who don't make mistakes

759
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
well if they're really smart then i

760
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,520
guess we don't do we uh i guess that

761
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,159
that then really is something which is a

762
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,000
challenge for all of us we suddenly

763
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,440
what we do see of course is sometimes uh

764
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
some changes in the way in which people

765
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
are operating so we may see gangs who

766
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,679
actually go out of business or be

767
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,200
maybe they grow up maybe they feel like

768
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
they've earned enough money and they

769
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,679
move on to do

770
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
other things maybe they go and enjoy the

771
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
money which they've stolen from

772
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
businesses instead

773
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
problem is of course plenty of other

774
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
criminals waiting to take their place

775
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
and i think one of the challenges is

776
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,039
so many uh like old school criminals

777
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,240
people who've been involved in

778
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
traditional crime are actually now

779
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,320
moving into cyber crime because they see

780
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,240
that there are real advantages there's

781
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,640
less chance perhaps of getting caught

782
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
if you commit to cyber crime than if you

783
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
try and rob a bank in person

784
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,440
certainly you're putting yourself at

785
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,640
less physical risk thank you

786
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
uh there are certainly some of your uh

787
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,080
fans among our viewers as well who

788
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
haven't necessarily

789
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,880
looked also your podcast and referred in

790
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
the question that it's

791
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,399
such a great pleasure to have such a

792
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
security chap

793
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,440
like graham cluley in saikon but there

794
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,000
is also

795
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,720
a good question with with that that

796
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
graham

797
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
how do i teach my kids or even better

798
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
how do i teach my colleagues proper

799
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,000
cyber security

800
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
hygiene without being disrespectful

801
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,159
yeah it's difficult isn't it i i think

802
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,000
with kids i think you start young

803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
i think quite early on i mean let's face

804
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
it most kids these days

805
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,679
are sort of permanently or automatically

806
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,200
attached to an

807
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,320
iphone or a tablet device or something

808
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,960
like that

809
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,559
so you can begin to teach them the

810
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,240
importance of passwords

811
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
you and you may occasionally test them

812
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
for instance you may say to them look

813
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,159
it's important

814
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,000
you to password protect things and then

815
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
as the parent you go what's your

816
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
password

817
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,760
and uh you actually

818
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
tell them well done if they won't tell

819
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
you the password because you say well

820
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
that's good because you shouldn't tell

821
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
me the password your password

822
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
should be secret to you not something

823
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,120
which you tell other people about so you

824
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
begin to teach people

825
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,799
the basics of privacy that way with your

826
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,440
colleagues

827
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,880
it's a little bit harder isn't it it's a

828
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
bit like learning a new foreign language

829
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,279
sometimes

830
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,720
i think what you have to do is make it

831
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,840
relevant to people so that they see the

832
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
advantages

833
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
so there are simple things which you can

834
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
begin to introduce

835
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,080
to just everybody uses computers really

836
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
like having a password manager

837
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,519
like the benefit of two-factor

838
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,360
authentication about being

839
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,480
careful about where you enter your login

840
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,000
details and checking that you're on the

841
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,880
site that which

842
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,559
you think so when you begin to explain

843
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,080
to people the benefits and show them

844
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
it's not that complicated to do these

845
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,640
things

846
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
they can dramatically improve their

847
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,080
personal security

848
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,799
what what upsets me is when people might

849
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
see their computer for instance pop up

850
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
and say oh you've got 12 security

851
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,320
updates to install

852
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,919
and they kind of go oh yeah that'd be

853
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
irritating let's delay that another day

854
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
you know that's

855
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
kind of ghouling to me it's like come on

856
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
if microsoft or apple or whoever it is

857
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,640
are pushing out security updates and say

858
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,159
they've got a problem you should take it

859
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,039
seriously and you should listen to it

860
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,279
thank you graham for reminding this

861
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,039
pretty elementary things uh

862
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,960
it's always important to go over those

863
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,440
and also for for all the answers and

864
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
for this very last keynote at this

865
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,279
year's cycle

866
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,320
it indeed was very enjoyable discussion

867
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
and i'm sure that we have all received

868
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
some great thoughts

869
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,360
to take along yes indeed

870
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
now this brings us almost to the end of

871
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
the first ever virtual cycon

872
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,200
although we would probably all prefer to

873
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
meet in person in tallinn

874
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
we hope that you the audience have

875
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,159
nevertheless enjoyed this

876
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,039
