00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,560
cyberspace i have learned

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
in my two and a half years in this job

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,920
that the first c in our

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
long acronym ccdcoe the first c stands

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,400
for cooperation and it's the most

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
important letter there

starting as the royal air force aviator

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,600
serving

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
through the several levels of command

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
all the way

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,559
to serving as the chief of defense of

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
the united kingdom

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
prior to assuming the current position

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
air chief marshall

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:13,439
welcome to saigon

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
your excellency ministers

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,479
ladies and gentlemen good morning

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
it's a great pleasure to address you all

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
today

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,240
i had the opportunity of visiting the

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,280
ccdoe

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
when i visited estonia in october last

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,560
year

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,240
i was very pleased to learn about the

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
centre's research reports training and

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
exercises

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
the work supported by allied and nato

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,240
partner nations

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
is vital in today's changing security

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
landscape

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
this conference bringing together so

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,640
many different groups of people

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
is also important we see every day that

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
cyberspace is being leveraged by state

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
and particularly non-state actors to

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,000
impede

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
deny disrupt distort and manipulate

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
information

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
cyber threats and attacks are becoming

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
more frequent more complex and more

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,200
destructive

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,719
there are no boundaries there are no

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,280
borders nations around the world have

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
incorporated cyber warfare forces as

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
part of their armed forces

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,840
nato should be no different cyber space

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
and space domains are entwined

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
along with traditional domains of

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
maritime air and ground

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
satellites are vulnerable to attack

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,239
nations find themselves blind in these

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,040
domains

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
would be in a difficult predicament

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
gps for example allows for safe

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
navigation in the air on land at sea

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
and also import underpins many other

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
parts of our lives

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
therefore multi-layered cyber defense is

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
essential

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
and it must be continually tested

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
because

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,519
those who wish us harm will exploit our

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
weakness we need networks and systems

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,879
that endure in a degraded environment

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,400
and we need to execute command and

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
control when we need to

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,400
degraded environments cannot always be

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,959
due to

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
conditions we can control such as

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
weather and other elements but we can

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
concern ourselves with gps jamming which

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
is deliberate activity

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
to contest the safe use of our systems

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
and nato's adversaries are investing

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,959
heavily

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
in cyber technology with little regard

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,879
for international law or human rights

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,200
and our values

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
somewhere there is a hacking attempt

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,480
every 30 seconds

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,720
and some of the best hackers stem from

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
those who wish us harm

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
there are many different types of cyber

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,640
attacks ranging from fishing

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,120
to the distributed denial of service and

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
now increasingly we see the

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
the the wicked crime of ransomware

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
more and more sophisticated every day

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
and we as an alliance do not need to

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
just

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
defend but we also need to deter and to

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
protect ourselves in the cyber area

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,640
protect our servers our satellites our

107
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
telecommunications

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
rit infrastructure the the

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
communications of our soldiers sailors

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,119
in airmen

111
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,599
so it's about prevention detection and

112
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,080
providing time and response

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
nato is responding and adapting to the

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
cyber threat in a number of different

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
ways

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
and we recognize that all allies stand

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,798
to benefit from a predictable

118
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,080
and secure cyberspace

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,919
international law is another area that

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
needs to apply to cyberspace

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
at the warsaw summit in 2016 allied

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
heads of state and government agreed on

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
a clear strategic vision

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
nato must be able to defend itself in

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
cyberspace

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
as effectively as it does on land in the

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
air and at

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,639
sea ever since we've integrated

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
cyberspace considerations into all

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
aspects of our planning

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,919
we've established a cyber operations

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
centre at mons in belgium

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
as part of our adapted command structure

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
this center also coordinates our

135
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
operational activity to ensure

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
our freedom of action whilst making our

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919
own operations more resilient and

138
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,560
protected from cyber attacks

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
in 2016 heads of state and government

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
also agreed on the creation of the cyber

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
defense pledge

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,960
committing nations and allies to enhance

143
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
the cyber defensive

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
defenses of their own national

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
infrastructure and networks

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
committing the fullest range of

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
capabilities

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
in addition to support nato several

149
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,759
allies have agreed to provide

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,160
their sovereign cyber effects effects

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
into

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
our alliance operations and missions

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
within nato certainly in our

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
headquarters in command structure we

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
should focus on

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,039
defending our own networks and ensuring

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,680
we have

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,960
broad resilience across the alliance

159
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
therefore we need to integrate cyber

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
defense

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
in all we do from the strategic the

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
operational and the tactical

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
we need to understand the threat

164
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
landscape and we need to share

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
information on that threat landscape and

166
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
the assessments

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
two years ago we approved for the first

168
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
time in 50 years

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
a nato military strategy to give

170
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
our allies and partners a common

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
understanding of our goals

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
our approaches and resource requirements

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,919
this is a fundamental shift

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
in outlook from capacity-based

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,199
assessments to

176
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,680
threat based assessments this is very

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
important

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
and it serves as a guide to commanders

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
on what we need to achieve

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
to maintain our security and the

181
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
resources that we need

182
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
and we build on this military strategy

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and have delivered two concepts

184
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
the concept for the the deterrence and

185
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
defense of the

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
euro-atlantic region which brings

187
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,520
together

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
all of our military planning as we face

189
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
a more unpredictable world and deal with

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
the consequences of a change security

191
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,080
environment

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
and secondly and importantly for the

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
future nato's war fighting

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,479
capstone concept looking out 20 years

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,440
this shapes our warfare development

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
trajectory

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
and informs the integrated efficient

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
development of our military instrument

199
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
of power

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
all of this work is necessary and

201
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
essential to keep us strong militarily

202
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
ensure our capabilities including cyber

203
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
remain fit for purpose

204
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,880
our annual cyber coalition exercise sees

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,680
teams

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,919
solving simulated cyber incidents to

207
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
enhance their understanding

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,240
through better shared information and

209
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
the cyber defense center of excellence

210
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,160
therefore plays an important role

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
organizing exercises like block shields

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
which brings together civilian military

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
experts

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
from allied and partner nations and i

215
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
would argue one of the most complex

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
technical

217
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,599
live challenges in the world

218
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
the center also contributes to training

219
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
by delivering internationally recognized

220
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,000
courses

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,319
developing reference cons documents to

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,080
set standards

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
in addition we have the coalition

224
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
warrior interoperability exercise cewix

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
another live exercise into which all

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
allies and partners practice

227
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
sharing tactics techniques and

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
procedures to improve the detection of

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
cyber incidents

230
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400
and a timely response

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
this exercise improves interoperability

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
for nations across

233
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
10 time zones therefore preparing for

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
our future

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
the secretary general has now launched

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,199
nato 2030 as an initiative

237
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,800
this is an ambitious agenda for

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
transatlantic security

239
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
at its core it has three objectives

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,399
to keep us strong as a military alliance

241
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,080
in a challenging security environment we

242
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
need to continue to invest

243
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
in deterrence and defense not only in

244
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
platforms but also in cyber and other

245
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,959
new capabilities

246
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
second we need to make nato a stronger

247
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
political alliance

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
and even if we have differences at times

249
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
nato is the only place

250
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
where north america and europe meet

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
every day with

252
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
authority to make decisions and we

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
therefore need to

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
solve our differences but remember what

255
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,399
unites us

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
and third and finally nato needs to be a

257
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
more global

258
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
alliance that does not necessarily mean

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
we take allies into the alliance from

260
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,640
all over the world

261
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
we remain at heart of regional alliance

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
but we will adopt

263
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
a global approach because the challenges

264
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,680
we face

265
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,519
such as cyber are themselves global

266
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
and it's hard to imagine any military

267
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
conflict

268
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
now or in the future without a cyber

269
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
dimension

270
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
in addition and worryingly we see

271
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,160
foreign investment

272
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
into many allies digital and

273
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
telecommunications industries

274
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
while noting one of the defining

275
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
features of cyberspace is

276
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
interconnectedness to ensure freedom of

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,640
action

278
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
and our own access we also need to make

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
sure that does not become

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
a vulnerability therefore we need to

281
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,600
screen

282
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
foreign investments in key

283
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
infrastructure and protect

284
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,519
key intellectual and technology

285
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,519
companies

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
before the night the 2019 pandemic began

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
we already in nato focused on resilience

288
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,079
this is more

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,839
than just looking after infrastructure

290
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,720
this is about networks including 5g

291
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
to ensure our infrastructure is safe

292
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
secure and trusted

293
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,320
so therefore we need to train research

294
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
and exercise

295
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
and in nato our cyber rapid response

296
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
teams are on standby to assist allies

297
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
24 hours a day if requested and we will

298
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,200
then respond to meet allied need

299
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
since the pandemic begun we've seen the

300
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
benefits of technology but we've also

301
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,959
seen the increased risk in the cyber

302
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,959
domain

303
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,519
as we move towards more into automation

304
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,240
and increased

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
online education online medical care

306
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,839
online working

307
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
online banking the cyber risks

308
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
accumulate

309
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,839
the north atlantic council issued a

310
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
statement in june 2020

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
deploring the malicious and cyber

312
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
destabilizing cyber activities

313
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
that increased including against medical

314
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,680
facilities during the pandemic

315
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,519
hospitals worth healthcare workers

316
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
research institutes

317
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
battling the coronavirus protecting

318
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
citizens under very difficult

319
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
circumstances with themselves attacked

320
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
by cyber attacks

321
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
so cyber space and the advent of new

322
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,839
technology

323
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
means that the use of information

324
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
warfare is everyday occurrence

325
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
we monitor disinformation and propaganda

326
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
as state and non-state actors try to sow

327
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,279
division

328
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
undermine our democracies and our

329
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
ability to act

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
we must counter false narratives with

331
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
facts with our values and with concrete

332
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
actions

333
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,920
this is a global problem and it affects

334
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
everybody here at this conference

335
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
we have a role to play in ensuring that

336
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,040
what we promote and share via social

337
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
media platforms

338
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,920
is accurate and is based on facts

339
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
with the increase in threats and attacks

340
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
cyber defense is no longer

341
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,920
solely a national matter no longer

342
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
solely a military matter

343
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
or indeed that other of a political

344
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,399
matter

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,600
it's an international concern

346
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
therefore we need to increase our

347
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
cooperation and coordination

348
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
including with the european union to be

349
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
effective

350
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
in our pursuit of cyber defense

351
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
and of course the private sector and

352
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,760
academia

353
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,440
has a key role to play working with us

354
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
and we need to encourage professional

355
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,560
development

356
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
in this field and this is more than

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
training and education it is actually

358
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
working together

359
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
and sharing our cyber experience in nato

360
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,480
repays

361
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
you as allies and partners

362
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
technical innovation expertise will

363
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
enable nato and allied countries

364
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,399
to respond to the cyber threat

365
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
the days of the military-leading

366
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
development

367
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
of technology have gone

368
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,839
now the private sector and academia and

369
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
small companies and individuals

370
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,920
are leading the way with emerging

371
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
technology and we need to work with all

372
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,600
of them

373
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
and keeping up with this pace of change

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
means increasing events such as this to

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,639
share back

376
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,360
best practice learn lessons not just

377
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
talk about policy

378
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
and then apply them cyberspace is a

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,279
domain where cooperation is key

380
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
cyber threats and cyber actors who wish

381
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,880
us harm

382
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
respect no boundaries in fact you can

383
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,600
argue our boundaries become our

384
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
vulnerabilities

385
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,279
we need to continue to find ways to

386
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,959
cooperate integrate

387
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,639
and work with industry the private

388
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,320
sector academe

389
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,760
and between governments because

390
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:00,480
we are stronger together thank you
