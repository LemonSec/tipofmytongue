the first session of the afternoon

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,160
uh we're going to talk about civilian

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,960
sector vulnerabilities to cyber attacks

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
my name is commander michael whitman i'm

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,560
the lead for the strategy branch here at

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
the nato cooperative cyber defense

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,238
center of excellence it's my distinct

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,079
pleasure to speak with you today and uh

11

we have a great panel

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
where we're going to talk about critical

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,960
infrastructure and

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,559
the civilian's role in protecting it

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,079
so during this session we're going to

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
talk about mitigation strategies

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,120
specifically to

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
three separate uh sectors within the

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
civilian community

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
we're going to look at aviation medical

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
and financial services we have an

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
outstanding group of uh panelists today

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:00,800
uh

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
they've joined forces and uh combined to

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,319
write uh three

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
incredible articles uh it was a pleasure

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,439
for me to uh

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,159

say their piece talk about their

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,080
individual piece

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,040
and then we'll open up four audience

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
questions at the end i would like the

36

need to

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
right off the bat and then uh follow it

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,720
up with uh questions

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
having said that uh if you do have

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
questions we have

42

their papers

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,840
the first paper being strategic cyber

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
effects to complex systems

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
understanding the u.s air transportation

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,599
sector

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,640
this panel will be headed by dr charles

and cyber security or magic which is a

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
great acronym

committees to provide testimony

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
his paper along with uh his co-author

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,159
uh dr uh skanta vitek

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,440
uh will provides basically a framework

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
for assessing cyber risk

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
uh the paper looks specifically at the

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,879
aviation sector

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
but the framework could be applied to

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
many other fields as well and with that

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
i'd like to

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
hand the floor open over to dr charles

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,239
harry

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
well thank you very much commander

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
whitman i really appreciate the

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,120
opportunity to

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
speak to you all today um the the paper

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
that we're going to talk about

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
today is really focused on an approach

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,360
for assessing

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
strategic effects is part of a way and

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
framework of understanding

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
strategic risk we all know

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
that cyber risk in complex systems is a

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,439
public concern

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
certainly the previous u.s

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,720
administration

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
highlighted this very deliberately in

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
their national cyber strategy

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
back in 2018 but it's safe to say that

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
the current administration

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
also views cyber as a national risk

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,760
uh specifically in light of most recent

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,918
events with colonial pipeline

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
so in that cyber strategy there is very

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,400
deliberate language that talks about

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
trying to estimate impact and risk

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,639
using a consequence driven approach and

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,520
what we've seen

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
over the years is kind of further

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,800
refinement

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
of that core idea very specifically

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
rooted in this idea of national critical

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
functions

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
that dhs and cisa have put out

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
where they really want to focus less on

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
just kind of a sector-specific

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
categorization and much more about

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
very specific strategic actions

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,759
that we need to protect as a nation and

128
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,960
so this is not just

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
obviously for the us but uh any nation

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
uh around the world so the example uh

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
and what we'll probably explore what we

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
will explore a little bit more today

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,199
uh in this quick chat is really about uh

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,639
how we transport cargo

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
and passengers by air as an example and

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,400
so

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,960
for instance cyber attacks and non-cyber

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
events have really been

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
affecting air infrastructure for uh

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,560
certainly over the last 10 years we have

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
a variety of non-cyber events that we've

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
seen

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
due to you know poor system rollouts

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,120
some some

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
physical damage done by fires and we

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
have clear examples from delta

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,400
to united southwest and alaskan airlines

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,919
that have all shown kind of a

149
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
large-scale set of disruption to flight

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,199
operations

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,960
but in addition to those non-cyber

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,720
events we've also seen cyber events

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
we've seen

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
uh attacks in poland in sweden in the

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,360
ukraine

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
uh and certainly in the united states

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
we've seen attacks

158
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
on some smaller regional carriers

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
including ryanair

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
uh in alaska and so

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
the uh threat actor strategic question

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,120
is really

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,199
how do i disrupt flight operations in a

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,319
target country

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,000
and there's different ways of achieving

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
this you can try to attack directly

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
aircraft systems

168
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
you can attack airport infrastructure

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,080
you can attack airline infrastructure

170
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,319
or certainly you can think about vendor

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,600
infrastructure

172
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
and so the way to kind of think about

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,120
this and and i'm going to use a couple

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
of cartoons here

175
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
is that um it's not just one system it's

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,919
not just

177
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
one device that uh can can lead to

178
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
flight disruption

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
and the reason is is because human

180
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
processes working together

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
really enable flight operations right

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
everything from passenger reservation

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,400
systems

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
flight planning software tower coms

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
fueling operations

186
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
taxiway lighting and when all those

187
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
things kind of work together

188
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,680
uh the plane can take off uh and

189
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
um so the the reality though

190
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
is that behind each one of those human

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
processes

192
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,199
are a series of uh specific

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,960
devices that when working together will

194
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
support those human processes

195
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
and eventually have the aircraft take

196
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
off

197
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
so the problem for the defenders is that

198
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
even if the majority of these systems

199
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
work

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
um a threat actor can gain access to

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
part of that in a set of interlinked

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,440
human processes and disrupt maybe just a

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
single device

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
which will cause a cascading failure so

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
you know one particular router gets

206
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
taken out flight planning

207
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
you know no longer works and now your

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
plane does not fly

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
and the problem with that is that as

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,720
that cascades

211
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
you now have the lack of flight

212
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
operations occurring at a particular

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,160
airport

214
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
and now what ends up happening is planes

215
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,759
cannot come and go

216
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,479
and then that ends up creating a set of

217
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
delayed flights

218
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
across the entire air network so what

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
we're talking about here is trying to

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
connect

221
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
through through this kind of set of

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
causal you know elements

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
how you can go from attacking specific

224
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
devices

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
to actually disrupting the entire

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
service that you care about

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
and so the the research questions uh

228
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
that we were concerned about in this

229
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,560
paper

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
were really about how do you try to

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
quantify the strategic effects

232
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
of a cyber attack on airports airlines

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,639
or even

234
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,599
vendors that can disrupt parts of the

235
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
passenger air network

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
uh and so we wanted to look at two

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
specific types of effects

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,599
one on the regional and national

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
capacity loss in the air network

240
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
uh and also we wanted to look at this

241
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
kind of propagation delay

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
uh that the impact on a particular

243
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
airport or airline has

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,959
on other connecting actors and then

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:53,680
basically

246
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
what what were the kind of greatest

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
areas of concern for national operators

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
and policy makers

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,279
so the in order to do this we

250
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,240
constructed

251
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
a large set of national and regional

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
graph structures

253
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
uh taking a look at various airports and

254
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
connecting them

255
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
by the flights and the number of

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
passengers that are actually flying

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
between the airports so

258
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
we took information from the department

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
of transportation the united states

260
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,760
and constructed based on 2019 data a set

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,320
of

262
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
interconnections between these various

263
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
airports so each airport represents

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
a node uh in this network and the

265
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,399
flights between

266
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,240
uh each one of those airports and the

267
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
number of

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
passengers that are flying represent the

269
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
edges or the edge connections

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
and so the idea was to be able to start

271
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
to look at different graph structures

272
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
based on

273
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
uh total flights as well as on in

274
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
specific so the first effect

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
uh that we wanted to look at was trying

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
to estimate this capacity loss

277
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
in the air network uh and so the idea

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
was can we take out nodes or can we take

279
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
out edges

280
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,519
and can we actually compute it in some

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
way and we developed something called

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
the strategic disruption index

283
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
um where we were able to look at

284
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
different effects where if i take down a

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
node i can calculate

286
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,000
an impact on between zero and one uh

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
and so a more central node is going to

288
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,279
generate uh

289
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
with more volume of traffic is going to

290
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
generate a higher uh

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
impact than um a node that's further out

292
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
in the network so in the first example a

293
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,680
very central node

294
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,320
generates a disruptive capacity loss of

295
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
almost 48 percent

296
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
and in our second example here uh the

297
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
further out you go in the network it's

298
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
much smaller it's only maybe roughly

299
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
three percent

300
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,040
so what what do we actually look when we

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
actually look at the data what do we see

302
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,399
well we find that um while the national

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,480
disruptions when even if you take a look

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,959
at

305
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,440
the most consequential airports is still

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
relatively small

307
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
atlanta is uh is the highest with about

308
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
four percent

309
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
of the entire national uh weighted uh

310
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
effective capacity is lost but what we

311
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,200
really find

312
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
interesting in this paper is that when

313
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
you break things up by region and we

314
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,200
broke it up by fema region a response

315
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,399
region

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
you actually see fairly distinct

317
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,760
differences between

318
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
national level effects and regional

319
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
effects and in some cases what you find

320
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
is that the structure of the regional

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
air network like fema region 1 which is

322
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,240
centered around boston logan airport

323
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
versus region 9 which is centered around

324
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,160
los angeles

325
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
generate very distinct and very

326
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,839
different

327
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,040
patterns of disruption which it was a

328
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
really interesting conclusion

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
we also find that when you look at

330
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
airlines airlines actually pose a

331
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,880
much more significant national level

332
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
disruption in the case

333
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
of the united states we find that

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
southwest can generate

335
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
uh more than twice the amount of

336
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,079
disruptive capacity

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
loss than than taking down the largest

338
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,120
airport

339
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
so southwest because of the nature of

340
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,360
their connections

341
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
and also the um

342
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,560
the number of passengers that are flying

343
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
on southwest generate

344
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,639
a disruption that's more than twice the

345
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,000
amount

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
what's really concerning however is when

347
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
you actually start taking a look at very

348
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
specific vendors and in one case that we

349
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,040
looked at

350
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,160
uh uh aerodata which is a german

351
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,720
um firm that handles a lot of

352
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,360
maintenance

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
elements uh we find that uh

354
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
you can actually take down operations at

355
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
multiple airlines simultaneously

356
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
and so in the case of aerodata there

357
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
were multiple flights including

358
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,519
southwest delta

359
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,240
united and jetblue that were unable to

360
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
fly for 40 minutes now this was not due

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
to a cyber attack this is due to a

362
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,959
botched

363
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,279
uh appears to be a botched uh software

364
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,079
rollout

365
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
but it begs the question of what does a

366
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,519
cyber attack

367
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,639
potentially mean i i you know if it's

368
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,560
intentionally targeted how much of this

369
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
effective capacity loss

370
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
can we actually see nationally and in

371
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
this case 36

372
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
of the entire u.s weighted national air

373
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
capacity was taken down for 40 minutes

374
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
so really underscores the importance of

375
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,279
looking at third party vendors

376
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
the second effect that we want to look

377
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
at was this kind of propagation delay

378
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
and so the idea is that if you take down

379
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,000
an airport like atlanta

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
you now have propagation of flight

381
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,760
delays because

382
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
aircraft uh and persons can no longer

383
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
um move from one airport to the next and

384
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
then that creates kind of a ripple

385
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,480
effect

386
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
across the air network and in fact when

387
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
we take a look at something like

388
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
atlanta if atlanta goes down you can see

389
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
this kind of propagation of delay over

390
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,839
time

391
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
uh increasing the number or the fraction

392
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
of flights that are potentially delayed

393
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
and we see that there's this kind of

394
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,040
range again of disruptive

395
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
and um national and regional

396
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,639
effects that really uh are quite

397
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,920
interesting to look at

398
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
and every uh airport ends up generating

399
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
kind of a distinct

400
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
mix so we also find that

401
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
airlines generate different patterns of

402
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
flight delays

403
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
and so if we were to take a look at

404
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
let's say an attack

405
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,760
on delta airlines you can see that

406
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
there's kind of a range of effects in

407
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,519
different regions in the united states

408
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:31,839
but

409
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
mostly centered along the east coast and

410
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,199
that makes sense

411
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,040
because that tends to track with the

412
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,519
the coverage that delta airlines

413
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
provides across the country

414
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
now if you were to compare that with

415
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
let's say alaskan airlines which

416
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
uh primarily focuses its operations in

417
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
the west you can see a distinct

418
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
difference

419
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,680
in effect so an attack on alaska is

420
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
going to have a very different

421
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
effect on the air network than you're

422
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,480
going to see

423
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
if you take down delta and of course if

424
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
we were to compare that with southwest

425
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
you can see that there's this kind of

426
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,639
interesting

427
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
set of disruptions both along the east

428
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
coast and the west coast

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
so what about those third-party vendors

430
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
though that we were just talking about

431
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,959
with aerodata well if we take a look at

432
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
aerodata and we were to do the same type

433
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,079
of analysis

434
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
and actually look at the at the real

435
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,079
data

436
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
that we were able to pull you can

437
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,680
actually see

438
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
that there are uh significant flight

439
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
delays um

440
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
roughly 200 to 300 percent

441
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,040
uh you know and and that will continue

442
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,519
to

443
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
um be seen across the air network from

444
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
april 1st all the way through april 5th

445
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
to 2019. so there's this

446
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
propagation of delay not only on the

447
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,160
date of the attack but

448
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,120
also how it continues to manifest itself

449
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
in the days afterwards

450
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,519
so what are some of the core takeaways

451
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,800
then well um

452
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
the core takeaways are that if you know

453
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:03,839
you are

454
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
interested in understanding national

455
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,839
level cyber risk

456
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
as applied to air infrastructure it is

457
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
largely driven by third party vendors

458
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,680
there are a handful of vendors that are

459
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
interconnected

460
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,160
across the range of commercial aircraft

461
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
and aircraft companies that if they are

462
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
taken down if some of those core systems

463
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
are taken down

464
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
have this propagation effect across

465
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,800
multiple

466
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,920
carriers simultaneously their coverage

467
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,680
in national air networks can generate

468
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,839
substantially

469
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,000
large losses of capacity

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and the details matter right so which

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,560
airports which airlines you target

472
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
which regional networks you choose to go

473
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,759
after even what day

474
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
and time of event will matter right so

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
and sometimes these results can be

476
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
somewhat counter-intuitive

477
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
there are large regional effects that

478
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
are oftentimes driven by disruptions to

479
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,639
smaller airports

480
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
and you know examples of that include

481
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,079
boston logan

482
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
it does not uh come up as a top 10

483
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
um top 10 loss uh

484
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
nationally but it ends up driving

485
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,400
basically a 30

486
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,199
level of disruption uh in just that

487
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,000
region

488
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
so uh prioritization of your defensive

489
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
investments uh you know must really

490
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,240
account

491
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
for the range of different attacks

492
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,359
either at the airport

493
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
at the airline or even at specific

494
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
vendor systems

495
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
now finally uh the um

496
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
there are a wide range of uh ways that

497
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
we can apply this exact same methodology

498
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
but to other sectors and we are doing

499
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
that with some work uh

500
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
ongoing right now including looking at

501
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
natural gas pipelines and the map that

502
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,559
i'm showing here

503
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,760
is one portion of the u.s

504
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,880
natural gas pipeline infrastructure but

505
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
what processing plants matter what

506
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
underground storage facilities matter

507
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
are all ways that we can leverage the

508
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
same type of graph analysis

509
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
and and propagation agent model that

510
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,080
we've developed

511
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
um so i'm happy uh after the the other

512
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
presentations to take any questions

513
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
and i really thank you again for the

514
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
opportunity to talk to you a little bit

515
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,320
about our research

516
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
so charles that was a a wonderful

517
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,679
presentation thank you very much and uh

518
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,039
thank you for reminding the audience

519
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,120
that if you do have any questions

520
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
we will wait till the end to address

521
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,080
those but feel free to go into the chat

522
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
put your questions and we'll have our

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
authors tackle them

524
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
at the end of the panels so our next

525
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,960
paper

526
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
is focusing on the cybersecurity posture

527
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
of german hospitals

528
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
the paper is entitled epidemic the

529
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
attack surface of german hospitals

530
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,640
during the covet 19 pandemic

531
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,919
this is a work by three authors robert

532
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:52,559
koch

533
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
thomas bransitter and johannes click

534
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,919
our presenter today will be johannes

535
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,960
click

536
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,200
he's the ceo of alpha strike labs and a

537
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,480
passionate

538
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,120
researcher and i.t security expert his

539
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
research focuses on global internet

540
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
scanning for threat analysis

541
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
and external attack surface detection as

542
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
well as identifying cyber security

543
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
infrastructures organizations and

544
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
companies

545
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
essentially this paper identifies

546
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
approximately a third of the nearly 1

547
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
600

548
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
german hospitals and clinics had some

549
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,320
type of

550
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,120
cyber vulnerability to some degree which

551
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,440
is

552
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
kind of scary especially given the

553
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
current

554
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
proven 19 pandemic to explain this a

555
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
little bit further i'm going to pass the

556
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,679
floor

557
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
to johannes johannes please the floor is

558
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
yours

559
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
yeah thank you very much um so robert

560
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,400
will start the session let me

561
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,520
start the session so please

562
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,120
oh i'm sorry so robert please robert yes

563
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,440
robert are you with us i'm i'm here um

564
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
if you have me on the screen that's

565
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
perfect so

566
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,880
okay so i can um start with the paper um

567
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
honest will take over in a couple of

568
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
seconds and describe

569
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,520
our approach um what we did during our

570
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,480
research so

571
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
the basic idea was when having a look to

572
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
the scenery last year

573
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,159
um based on the covet 19 pandemic

574
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,440
um in the beginning um there were quite

575
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,799
some announcement of

576
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,640
um famous or infamous ransomware gangs

577
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
that well that um the critical

578
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
infrastructure that hospitals will not

579
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,240
be an

580
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,760
attack target um based on the situation

581
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,320
and um later on of course there are a

582
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
lot of money

583
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
in the game a lot of um bugs

584
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
we had some targeted attacks on

585
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
hospitals in the sector

586
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,240
and that skyrocketed very much

587
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
so um while india in

588
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
october 2020 we had a

589
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
announcement a warning from three

590
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,720
agencies in the united states

591
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
so um together by the fbi the u.s

592
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,559
department of health and human services

593
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,559
and the cyber security infrastructure

594
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,159
security agency

595
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,440
um there was an uh warning um based on

596
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,559
a big wave of ransomware attacks on

597
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,000
hospitals so

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
about 250 hospitals had been hit by

599
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,799
ransomware attacks

600
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,919
and um if we have a look to germany

601
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,039
we had an intense discussion based on a

602
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
case where a patient died on the way to

603
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,280
a hospital

604
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,400
because the university clinic of

605
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
dusseldorf

606
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,120
had to shut down its emergency room

607
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,159
because of a ransomware attack and

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,120
patients have to be taken to surrounding

609
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
hospitals

610
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,880
and that resulted in additional travel

611
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
times up to 30 minutes so

612
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,520
one patient died um very soon after

613
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,559
arriving at an

614
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,039
uh hospital because the nearest hospital

615
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,159
the ukd

616
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,120
was not available um it was finally um

617
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
analyzed that the patient would have

618
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,799
died anyway

619
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,679
but i think about for example cases of

620
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
strokes or something like that where

621
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,760
time is really a critical aspect

622
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,720
um then that could be an um a point

623
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
where a ransomware attack may result

624
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,480
in the loss of life so um our research

625
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
interest was to

626
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,960
identify the public-facing attack

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
surface of

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,120
german hospitals during the

629
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,880
pandemic and hannes will now present you

630
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
the structure we built up um to scan the

631
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,919
systems in the internet and

632
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,280
to get the data we required for

633
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,600
our research so please harness

634
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
yeah thanks hello so at first

635
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
so um exactly we thought okay what is

636
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,200
about the german hospital

637
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,240
so we are zappos strike labs we are

638
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,280
scanning the whole internet globally

639
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
every day and we thought oh can we maybe

640
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
use these scan data from the global

641
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,000
internet

642
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,120
to identify german hospitals and

643
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
to to find vulnerabilities and

644
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
therefore we have our so we are our own

645
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
internet service provider and we have

646
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
over 1 000 different ipv4

647
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
addresses to distribute our scan traffic

648
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,000
to find all network services

649
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
available network services on the

650
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
internet and

651
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,879
how we do that is that we

652
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
that we have our own slash 22 ipv4

653
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
network

654
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
and distributes the scanning we scan

655
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
very fast

656
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,919
like several hours for for for one

657
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,480
network service port combination we scan

658
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
2.8 billion routed ip addresses and

659
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,840
support over

660
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
60 different protocols and in that way

661
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
we are able to identify external ip

662
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
addresses network topologies websites

663
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
vulnerabilities that belong to an

664
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
enterprise critical infrastructure or

665
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,240
governmental organization

666
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
and that is

667
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,480
for us very important and here you can

668
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
see how our system works at first we are

669
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,039
have

670
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
uh our front runner there we say which

671
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
addresses we want to scan we say okay

672
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
please scan the whole internet then all

673
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
the ip addresses will be generated and

674
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
the scan master

675
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
will define the scanned strategy in the

676
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
majority of our scans we are

677
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
taking we are sort of randomizing all ip

678
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
addresses so we are taking

679
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
appear addresses and small buckets of

680
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
work and providing them to

681
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
on the internet distributed scan nodes

682
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
then these scan nodes are scanning for

683
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
open ports on the internet and if they

684
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,440
find an open port

685
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
then we will start the app scanner and

686
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
try to identify which kind of network

687
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,240
services

688
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,880
is behind the open port and in that way

689
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,039
we are scanning globally the internet

690
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,840
and now the very important part comes

691
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,480
that

692
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
is the data enrichment then we have all

693
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,080
the information of

694
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,000
what kind of network service is open and

695
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
running there on the internet

696
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,120
and then we do some kind of attribution

697
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
or more better

698
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
we we add a lot of other uh open

699
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,919
available information like who is

700
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,600
information so who is the owner

701
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
of the ip address reverse dns

702
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,679
information so what is the domain of the

703
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,080
ip address the go ip location so

704
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,799
where is the approximate location of the

705
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,559
service where is the service running

706
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,039
on the world and also bgp routing and

707
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
autonomous system information so we know

708
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
who is the owner of the ip address who

709
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
is running the service and so on and we

710
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,000
taking all the data putting it together

711
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
and putting it in a big

712
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,480
on a big database and then we developed

713
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
a front end

714
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,080
where we can analyze all the data so

715
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,000
here you can see a screenshot from this

716
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
kind of analyze

717
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
framework analyzer framework recorded

718
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,120
inspector um this means we can

719
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
see we can go step by step through the

720
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
results so our analysis is that we

721
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
do not automatically analyze all the

722
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,640
information by an algorithm

723
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
we do a semi-automatic way this means we

724
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
have like pre-sorting by our algorithm

725
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,440
and then we have a manual verification

726
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,880
of the results using the

727
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,960
inspector front-end so here first you

728
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
can see we can identify what kind of uh

729
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
what is the name of the ual or what is

730
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
the domain we can see

731
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
what is the service banner of the

732
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
services means at which which kind of

733
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,919
software version has

734
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
has the saw has the network service

735
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,520
identified itself

736
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
then we match all the network services

737
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,120
we have identified through a common

738
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
platform enumerators this means we

739
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,520
have found a standardized way to

740
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
identify software to put it to a

741
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
standified

742
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
unique identifier and having this unique

743
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,720
identifier for the specific software and

744
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
software version then we can match to

745
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
vulnerabilities then we can look or is

746
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
for the software version and

747
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,559
vulnerability available or not

748
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,919
and then having found some

749
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
vulnerabilities or not then we can also

750
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,640
check if

751
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
maybe some exploits or malware is

752
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
specifically available

753
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
on open public exploit databases and on

754
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,320
the right side you can also see in case

755
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
that we have web services we have also

756
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,320
screenshots for verification that

757
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,120
the the service is really belonging to

758
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
the entity we are looking for

759
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,480
and using these techniques these global

760
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,399
scan techniques and these semi-automatic

761
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,120
analysis

762
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,480
analyzes way and this front end for

763
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
for vulnerability identification and

764
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
also for force positive identification

765
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
um then we have connected this big

766
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,960
database

767
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
with the dv internet register uh

768
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,600
intensive care registers what is a dv

769
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,039
register so in germany

770
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,480
we have more than 1 300 hospitals

771
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,120
with a tens of care units for covert 19

772
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,159
patients

773
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
and there's a big open database it's

774
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,919
available and we can download the

775
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,600
database and understand the name

776
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,279
for each hospital and for

777
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
and approximate a geographical position

778
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
of the of the hospital so we have and

779
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,640
then

780
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
we have also research for each hospital

781
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
as a domain name and that was everything

782
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
that we have entered into our search

783
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
engines this means we entered in our

784
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,919
search engine

785
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,200
in the end 1 300 names of hospitals from

786
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
the intensive care unit register of

787
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,440
germany

788
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
and also one thousand three and then

789
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
approximate uh one thousand domains

790
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,919
uh domain names of these hospitals and

791
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,360
then we found

792
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
a a lot of a lot of services

793
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,600
so we have looked for 89 different

794
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,159
protocol scans have analyzed about 1.5

795
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
terabyte of data

796
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,159
it took like 60 hours on a 64 cpu core

797
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,880
system

798
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,919
and we have identified over

799
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,480
14 13

800
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,799
13 500 network services on the internet

801
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,840
and this um for timelines i will get

802
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,480
that

803
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,399
and this means that we have identified

804
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,120
approximately

805
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,480
from these 1 300 hospitals

806
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
according to 13 000 network services we

807
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,679
have found

808
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,720
that approximately for 400

809
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,399
500 hospitals have been vulnerable this

810
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
means we have identified our network

811
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,919
services of the hospitals

812
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,399
and then we can say okay from all 128

813
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,720
hospitals we have found approximately 36

814
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,279
percent

815
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
have at least one vulnerable rep or

816
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,320
internet service

817
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
that's a quite high number that means

818
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
there's more than one third of german

819
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
identified hospitals has

820
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
has a has at least one vulnerable

821
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,279
service

822
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,559
so at next what we have done um we can

823
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,039
we have seen here in the chart you can

824
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,360
see that more than 50 percent of all the

825
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
network services

826
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,679
identify themselves with their specific

827
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,480
version number

828
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,240
certain security best practices that the

829
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,320
network service does not identify itself

830
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,960
so

831
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
in a way that you can predict the

832
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,399
service number or the operating

833
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
service type and here you can see we can

834
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,840
see that microsoft

835
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
is running or is it an open ssh or

836
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,760
specific web services are running

837
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,159
so this means every second hospital

838
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,440
server identifies this

839
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,279
specific version number and this helps

840
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,799
attackers to identify also

841
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
vulnerabilities

842
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,320
um exactly so and

843
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
furthermore very interesting to see is

844
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
that a lot of

845
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
that you can see the distribution of

846
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
windows services we have found and we

847
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,039
can see that also some hospitals are

848
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,520
running

849
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,960
a very old windows 2000 windows xp

850
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,279
windows xp services like you can see

851
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,760
microsoft is 6.0

852
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,159
that's very very old services that are

853
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,120
running that are like

854
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,440
uh 10 years not patched right not

855
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,399
patchable because

856
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,720
microsoft has ended the support we can

857
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
see that uh

858
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
also one twenty-five percent

859
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,240
approximately use very very new windows

860
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,720
10

861
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,679
but we have a lot of the older windows

862
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,799
windows sevens are

863
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
running in the end so now very

864
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,480
interesting here is

865
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
the geographical distribution

866
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
distribution of the hospitals

867
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
on the left side you can see all

868
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,080
hospitals that we have identified in the

869
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,399
german intensive care unit register

870
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,600
register and on the right side

871
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
so that has a network service on the

872
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
left left side and on the right side you

873
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,480
can see all

874
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,840
vulnerable german hospitals and you can

875
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,480
see that this is not a specific uh

876
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
uh not the specific urban problems or

877
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,399
the rule problems this means

878
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,080
it makes no difference if it's a

879
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
hospital that is

880
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,080
in a city or that is somewhere in the

881
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,240
country right very interesting to see

882
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,080
then we have also done uh further

883
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,360
analysis we have

884
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
we have seen okay this picture here

885
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,640
shows

886
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
the uh the hospitals according to the

887
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,159
geo

888
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
geographical solution provided by the

889
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
intensive care risk

890
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
register then we have taken our own

891
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,840
geoip

892
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,080
geographic solution this means we have

893
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,919
taken our internet service

894
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,159
results and have predicted according to

895
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,240
the network service ip address

896
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,320
where approximately the easy horse

897
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
presets are located

898
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,120
and here we can also see the same

899
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,279
picture because it could be maybe happen

900
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:03,760
that

901
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
also hospitals have maybe some cloud

902
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,840
systems running and so on

903
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,200
but here we can see that the

904
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,279
distribution

905
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,679
is quite equal so it's very interesting

906
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,399
to see

907
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,679
that also the network services

908
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
are quite near located uh through where

909
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
also the hospitals are located

910
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,799
that means that there's a higher high

911
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,840
probability that

912
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
crossfires are not using that much cloud

913
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,880
systems in the end

914
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,080
very interesting okay now robert will

915
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,399
uh now robert will speak about the

916
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,519
distribution of the

917
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,080
of the of the criticalness of the

918
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,640
network services we have found

919
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,279
thank you very much um so in this

920
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,880
picture you can see

921
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
the overall distribution of the severity

922
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,760
of the different um vulnerabilities we

923
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,279
identified

924
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,279
we did the analysis based on the common

925
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,279
vulnerability scoring system which is

926
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:57,679
very

927
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
very famous so the worst vulnerabilities

928
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,559
are rated uh 10.0 and you can find

929
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,760
um that we identified a huge number of

930
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,799
very critical

931
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,000
vulnerabilities so over 900 um

932
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,760
rated 9.0 to 10.0 and just to give you

933
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
an idea we identified for example some

934
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,039
windows xp operating systems which are

935
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,919
10.0 and the end of support was back in

936
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,279
2015

937
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
we identified and you see the changing

938
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,679
situation with a lot of

939
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,679
remote work and home office and stuff

940
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,240
like that um for example open cheats

941
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,679
video chat servers

942
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,600
or um we identified um open

943
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,559
unauthenticated scriptwork

944
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,039
proxies so proxy servers which can be

945
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,960
easily abused for example

946
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,279
um executing attacks or something like

947
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
that a lot of outdated apache php

948
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,039
installations

949
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,159
things like that or siterix remote

950
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,279
access

951
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,360
vulnerabilities rated 10.0

952
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,039
or for example rtp connections

953
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,360
facing directly the web so a lot of

954
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
really severe

955
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,000
vulnerabilities within the data

956
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
another aspect we had a look to was when

957
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,839
thinking about critical infrastructure

958
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,520
are there differences between the

959
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
hospitals so having a look at germany

960
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,679
we have specific laws for hospitals

961
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,079
that have to be fulfilled when they

962
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,079
belong to the critical infrastructure so

963
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,280
in germany

964
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
um hospitals which have at least 30

965
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
000 inpatients per year belong to the

966
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
critical infrastructure and therefore

967
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,159
they have

968
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
higher liabilities resulting from the um

969
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,480
greetings act in germany so there are

970
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
additional

971
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,639
laws they have to fulfill and if we had

972
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,480
a look to the data we had a quite

973
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,918
surprising picture

974
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,280
as you can see in the graph um

975
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,880
with with a look at all hospitals up to

976
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,560
1800 beds we have in average about

977
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,079
four vulnerabilities per hospital

978
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,320
and when only looking at critical

979
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
infrastructure hospitals

980
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,400
so you may think okay they have a higher

981
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
security

982
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,040
we had in average more than 11

983
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,240
vulnerabilities per hospital

984
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
so thinking about that you can explain

985
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
that because yeah universal hospitals

986
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
are very huge a lot of these

987
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,079
very big installations are university

988
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,240
hospitals they have a lot of

989
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,480
different research areas and things like

990
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,280
that so

991
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
normally they may use a bigger variety

992
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,240
of software and things like that

993
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
so you can explain the picture but at

994
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,440
least

995
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,560
it shows that the hospitals belonging to

996
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
the critical infrastructure

997
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,079
are not more secure than the average

998
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,119
hospitals

999
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,480
so to summarize it we identified a huge

1000
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,520
number of german hospitals over 1500

1001
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,400
hospitals

1002
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,040
with around 1300 network services

1003
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,320
running and nearly one-third of these

1004
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,839
network services

1005
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,720
had vulnerabilities and as you um were

1006
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,599
able to see

1007
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,880
a lot of them with the vulnerabilities

1008
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,560
up to um very high scores 10.0

1009
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
so about one-third of the german

1010
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
hospitals we examined

1011
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,119
um have some vulnerabilities in their

1012
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,560
network services

1013
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,839
and there's no difference between rural

1014
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,599
or urban regions

1015
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,440
both is affected and as i

1016
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,280
mentioned the final aspect the critical

1017
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,040
infrastructures hospitals

1018
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,560
are not more secure based on the data

1019
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,760
when looking at the public facing

1020
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,560
attack surface in the internet so um

1021
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
quite

1022
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,480
a huge number of interesting um results

1023
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,119
some surprisingly and we will be happy

1024
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:55,680
to

1025
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,079
answer your questions after the last

1026
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,520
presentation thank you very much

1027
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,440
so johannes robert thank you very much

1028
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
for your very interesting

1029
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,640
and topical paper presentation

1030
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
like you mentioned we'll be taking

1031
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,760
questions at the end so if you have any

1032
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
questions please type them into the text

1033
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
box

1034
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,359
our final paper will be presented by

1035
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,560
bobby vitrill

1036
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,480
the paper's entitled the vulnerability

1037
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,119
of financial systems to a systemic cyber

1038
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,640
attack

1039
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,320
bobby is the managing partner of micro

1040
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,560
eagle capital and a phd candidate at the

1041
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,920

1042
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,599
buckingham university

1043
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,520
he's got 20 plus years of capital market

1044
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,640
experience in london

1045
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,160
with the latest being as a partner at

1046
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,839
goldman sachs

1047
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
uh bobby in this paper you posed two

1048
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,680
questions first is there

1049
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,800
sufficient new instructional

1050
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
vulnerabilities in the financial

1051
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,040
ecosystem that can be exploited by a

1052
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
willing adversary

1053
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
and second are there plausible scenarios

1054
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
that could see an adversarial

1055
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,880
nation-state launch such an attack and

1056
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
uh the answer to both of those was

1057
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,119
positive

1058
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,440
uh which is pretty scary uh so i'd like

1059
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
to hand you the floor to uh

1060
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,079
explain further thank you yeah thank you

1061
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,119
thank you very much for inviting me um

1062
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,520
so if i uh go through the presentation

1063
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,560
uh maybe

1064
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,520
what i will do first actually is go to

1065
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,880
um

1066
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,040
hold on a second uh

1067
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,480
sorry yeah um so talk first about

1068
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
the financial sector in itself financial

1069
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
sector uh uh in itself we have um

1070
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,760
we have obviously the are the number one

1071
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,800
industry uh

1072
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
um sensitive to cyber attack but mainly

1073
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,000
crime uh in fact the latest bis paper

1074
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,920
puts the the frequency of attacks at 24

1075
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,359
for the finance and insurance industry

1076
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,680
which is the highest but interestingly

1077
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
the total loss is only 16

1078
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
and that's obviously because it's a very

1079
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,359
well defended because it's a very well

1080
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,000
funded

1081
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,280
uh industry uh and so actually the the

1082
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
mean loss

1083
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
of the single cyber attack is actually

1084
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,480
quite low it doesn't even make it into

1085
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,599
the 10th percentile

1086
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,440
uh compared to other industries so what

1087
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,200
this really tells you is

1088
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,800
and what this graph here i try to show

1089
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,760
is what we see uh in finance a lot and

1090
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,359
more than any other industry

1091
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,880
is a huge amount of idiosyncratic

1092
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,720
cyber attacks so which are most

1093
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,240
criminal in nature the combination of

1094
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,480
them in some of the numbers is very high

1095
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,599
the net loss is uh again is

1096
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,040
is is is high but low regarding the

1097
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
number of attacks

1098
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,000
but what we don't see uh is a

1099
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,440
really uh systemic cyber attack on

1100
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,880
finance so what this paper tries or what

1101
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,720
sorry what this image this illustration

1102
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,160
tries to show

1103
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,000
is that there are three types of

1104
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,920
situations as i said before we have the

1105
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
idiosyncratic the attack on a single

1106
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
bank or insurance company

1107
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,960
then we have the danger that that attack

1108
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,680
spills

1109
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,280
over into the broad financial system

1110
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,480
and i call this a systemic cyber

1111
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,040
incident

1112
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,119
by spillover because obviously the

1113
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,359
systemic attack was not intended

1114
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,200
and i i mean with systemic here that the

1115
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,440
paralyzation of the financial industry

1116
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,119
leads to the paralyzation of the real

1117
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,319
economy which is

1118
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,440
really the problem a systemic

1119
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
crisis poses as we saw during the great

1120
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,720
financial crisis of 2008.

1121
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,520
the last one the systemic attack which

1122
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,079
is

1123
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,119
the an attack lounged with the intent

1124
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,920
to bring down the financial system that

1125
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,640
is something

1126
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,119
we haven't seen at all the problem is

1127
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,440
certainly from the national security

1128
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,319
sector

1129
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,040
this is something which gets mentioned

1130
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
since the earliest days

1131
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,560
but because of the lack of evidence

1132
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,480
it has been pretty much brought down to

1133
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,839
threat inflation and obviously

1134
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,079
the corporations the banks themselves

1135
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,400
focus on the idiosyncratic attacks on

1136
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,680
crime

1137
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,119
and the regulators mainly focus on

1138
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,319
this idiosyncratic attacks not spilling

1139
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:16,720
over

1140
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,760
into the broader financial system

1141
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,920
but there's very little attention on

1142
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
this systemic

1143
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,200
nature now why do we

1144
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,079
see no systemic attacks on the financial

1145
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:30,560
system

1146
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,680
but there are three very logical reasons

1147
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,520
number one is even adversary states

1148
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,000
need the system to work uh in order to

1149
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,119
take the money out

1150
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,520
so even north korea has zero interest in

1151
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
in bringing down the system given that

1152
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,040
they're busy

1153
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,520
stealing money from banks the second

1154
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,480
thing is

1155
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,960
most adversarial states actually do need

1156
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
capitalist resources themselves

1157
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,520
to fund their growth so why bring that

1158
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
system down

1159
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,800
and the third is if you really want to

1160
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
launch a systemic

1161
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
attack on another country there is

1162
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,200
probably

1163
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
way easier and less defended sectors

1164
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,119
than the financial

1165
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,960
sector to attack now given that there is

1166
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,920
no

1167
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
numbers we can look at because there is

1168
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,520
zero evidence so far

1169
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,880
of a systemic cyber attack or indeed

1170
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,440
of any idiosyncratic attack spilling

1171
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,839
over into systemic

1172
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,359
i have come up with a conceptual

1173
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,440
framework where i look at basically you

1174
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,640
know what is the

1175
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,599
the probability adjusted economic cost

1176
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,760
of such a systemic attack

1177
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,599
and that must obviously equal the

1178
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,359
expected economic cost

1179
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,079
of of of if it happens times the

1180
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,119
probability

1181
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,640
of a successful attack and this

1182
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,240
probability of a successful attack is

1183
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,160
obviously a function of three things

1184
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,640
the number of possible vulnerabilities

1185
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,359
um

1186
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,800
the the um the technical ability to act

1187
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,680
to do it

1188
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,640
and they intend to do it now in this

1189
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,839
paper

1190
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,000
i will focus on this probability but i

1191
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,880
will not

1192
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,839
focus on the technical ability because i

1193
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,240
think

1194
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,800
most professionals and regulators agree

1195
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,560
that the technology

1196
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,960
technological ability will exist if the

1197
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,800
if the intent is there

1198
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,440
so we'll only focus on vulnerability and

1199
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,480
intent

1200
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,040
and also when i look in my discussions

1201
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,760
with chief security officers of banks

1202
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,520
uh mainly the big uh they broadly agree

1203
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
that vulnerabilities

1204
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,119
definitely exist but the big question is

1205
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,119
the intent so i will do the intent

1206
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,560
at the back and first speak about uh the

1207
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,760
vulnerabilities before i do that i want

1208
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
to give a quick

1209
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,599
review about uh the literature and the

1210
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,359
studies out there

1211
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,480
as you can see from uh this

1212
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
graph here this is from the bank of

1213
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,760
england

1214
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,000
systemic risk survey so this is you know

1215
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,319
grows out to the banks in london

1216
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,960
and what they categorize their their

1217
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,760
their biggest

1218
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,520
systemic concern and as you can see um

1219
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
really cyber systemic risk really only a

1220
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
concern since 2014

1221
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,280
this is in not surprising and surprising

1222
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,000
um

1223
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,560
the whole concept of systemic risk

1224
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,079
really only started with the great

1225
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
financial crisis

1226
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,760
but obviously regulators back then

1227
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
focused on quantifiable risks like

1228
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,920
markets risk credit risk liquidity risk

1229
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,680
they didn't really look at cyber risk

1230
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,040
cyber risk is

1231
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,960
a subcategory of operational risk in the

1232
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,640
regulator

1233
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,200
terminology and so it was of less

1234
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,400
importance

1235
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,440
the 2014 interest really only searched

1236
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,400
because of the

1237
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,119
um attack on jp morgan where 83 million

1238
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,560
accounts were attacked and it probably

1239
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
was a retaliation

1240
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,200
by the iranians on stuxnet um and then

1241
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,920
obviously 2016 we had the uh

1242
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
north korea attempt to steal almost a

1243
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,440
billion dollars from the bangladesh

1244
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,400
central bank

1245
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
back then then we had the g7 issue

1246
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
statements on fundamental evidence of

1247
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,599
cyber security for the financial sector

1248
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,359
and really only in 2018 that things uh

1249
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,800
from the regulated sites become

1250
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
more active we had the bank of england

1251
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,000
publish

1252
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
two important papers one saying that

1253
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
just because a systemic attack hasn't

1254
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,280
happened doesn't mean it won't happen

1255
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,480
and the second was that a paper on

1256
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,680
the importance of having

1257
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
operational resilience which is a very

1258
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,200
interesting

1259
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,040
innovation the regulatory approach

1260
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,960
because it basically says

1261
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,800
as a bank as a provider of financial

1262
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,480
services you should be

1263
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,200
ready to provide those services even if

1264
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,400
all the technical

1265
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,440
uh capability has collapsed and i think

1266
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,359
this is a very interesting

1267
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,599
point because in many discussions with

1268
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,720
regulators

1269
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,040
um they would say that the financial

1270
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,359
sector is now so digitized that actually

1271
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,240
if the system is compromised there is no

1272
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,640
way

1273
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,839
of going back to manuel

1274
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,920
we then really have 2018 as well a good

1275
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
paper by jason healey from the brookings

1276
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,640
institute

1277
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,960
who described the key difference between

1278
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,560
a financial

1279
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,160
and cyber shock and what the

1280
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,359
finance people

1281
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,520
recognize is that a cyber shock is

1282
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,200
obviously

1283
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,440
comes with intent the timing can be

1284
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,720
specified

1285
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
and it increases the complexity of the

1286
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,720
situation

1287
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,040
which is something that normally you

1288
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,560
know if one considers the financial side

1289
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
complex enough

1290
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,560
uh would obviously add to the chaos then

1291
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:34,880
and

1292
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,000
literally just last year we had

1293
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,079
more interesting developments the esrb

1294
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,520
the european systemic risk board

1295
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,119
published two papers

1296
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,000
on um on hypothetical systemic cyber

1297
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,880
attacks

1298
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,839
and the carnegie endowment has produced

1299
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,680
a very big report to focus on it so all

1300
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,040
i'm saying here is

1301
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,359
the good news is that the focus on it

1302
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,760
has increased substantially

1303
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,720
but the problem a bit is that it's still

1304
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,920
very much

1305
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,520
focused on what i call a systemic

1306
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,160
risk by spillover i.e that an attack on

1307
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,760
a specific institution leads to the

1308
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,119
system to come down

1309
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,680
rather than to a systemic attack by

1310
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,800
intent

1311
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,160
now a systemic by attack by intent

1312
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,000
as i said before is a question of the

1313
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,440
number of vulnerabilities i

1314
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,400
i listed 10 in my papers of literally

1315
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
just the structural vulnerabilities of

1316
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,520
the system

1317
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,040
they don't mean to be all encompassing

1318
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,240
it's just really to show how the system

1319
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,640
is

1320
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,319
structured in against the the western

1321
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:38,640
sys

1322
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,280
the west in in case this happens number

1323
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,880
one is just the degree of openness if we

1324
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,200
look here at the us and uk which is by

1325
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,720
far the biggest financial centers in the

1326
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,359
west

1327
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,160
you can see when we rank them by

1328
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,440
economic power

1329
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,960
and size um actually the adversarial

1330
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
states are mainly

1331
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
you know very different when it comes to

1332
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,079
gdp and size

1333
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,240
but they almost don't defer when it

1334
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,920
comes to financial openness they're all

1335
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,480
incredibly close the quick example is

1336
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,920
you know the five biggest banks in the

1337
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,599
world are chinese by asset

1338
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,520
but you hardly have seen any chinese

1339
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,920
branch here wherever you are right now

1340
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
and so you see they are not very

1341
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,680
connected at all into the international

1342
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,760
system while the western banks are very

1343
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,680
connected the second point is obviously

1344
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,319
the effects it has on domestic politics

1345
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,240
we can see for example the events in

1346
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,559
hong kong with a new security law

1347
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,680
um western banks with important

1348
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
presence like hsbc standard uncharted

1349
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,480
immediately had to um

1350
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,280
you know support that new law and that

1351
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,040
obviously has the potential to literally

1352
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,720
create domestically for tension

1353
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
in britain or in western countries again

1354
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,960
a problem that these other banks these

1355
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
other countries don't don't have

1356
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,960
the third thing is uh currency

1357
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,520
concentration uh currency concentration

1358
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,280
is uh i don't have the chart now here

1359
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,599
but

1360
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,559
but basically um pretty much 40 you know

1361
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:01,119
80

1362
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,280
of trading is in the dollar um this

1363
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,720
currency concentration

1364
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,440
uh is a result of the fact that among

1365
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,880
other things the chinese are not

1366
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,559
liberating their markets so it is you

1367
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,599
know the u1

1368
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,240
is very lowly represented but obviously

1369
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,000
all you need to do is affect the dollar

1370
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,640
and you and you create a massive crisis

1371
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,839
of confidence uh

1372
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,119
in the in the in the west um the next

1373
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:23,599
slide

1374
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,960
is here uh uh counterparty concentration

1375
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,160
i mean what's interesting prophet

1376
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,240
dr harry just now his uh when he when i

1377
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,440
saw these airport

1378
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
charts reminded me of of um how we

1379
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,319
now currently reorganize the financial

1380
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,480
sector after the crisis so on the left

1381
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,359
you see

1382
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,280
before the financial crisis almost

1383
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,119
everybody traded with everybody

1384
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,920
there was a part of the problem is that

1385
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,319
once

1386
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,079
trust collapsed nobody wanted to trade

1387
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,240
with anybody and so the system got

1388
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,359
restructured

1389
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,800
in a way that we all trade with each

1390
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,359
other

1391
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,040
through central counterparties but

1392
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
obviously from a security point of view

1393
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,200
that increases uh the number of single

1394
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,720
points of failure

1395
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,000
which is exactly the last thing you

1396
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,960
would do from a defense perspective

1397
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,000
and another uh important vulnerabilities

1398
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,319
is

1399
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,480
you know we see a concentration of

1400
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,839
counterparties

1401
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,440
uh in finance like we see in other

1402
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,599
industries we have um

1403
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,760
and again very similar to the analysis

1404
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,359
of dr harry just now with what the

1405
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,640
aviation

1406
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,960
is there's a fed paper which say that

1407
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,000
you know 23

1408
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,440
small financial institutions uh is the

1409
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,599
en enough to attack to bring one of the

1410
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,720
big five down

1411
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
so you actually don't need to attack the

1412
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,160
big financial institution you just need

1413
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,200
to focus on the small ones um

1414
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,960
same is with a geographical uh

1415
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,640
concentration obviously

1416
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,760
most is in the us in the uk and then

1417
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,720
obviously we have

1418
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,839
the issue with the rapid increase in

1419
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,960
fintech and digitalization in in finance

1420
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,520
which is not just a problem from the

1421
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,400
fact that

1422
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
now increasingly um systems get used

1423
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,319
from

1424
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,839
which were developed outside of the

1425
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,760
banking system is also that

1426
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
the the regulators are hardly managing

1427
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,359
to catch up with those

1428
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,960
developments and then lastly from

1429
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,000
when it comes to information operations

1430
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,760
obviously the financial sector is one

1431
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,760
which which completely relies

1432
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,680
on data news and trust if if data gets

1433
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,480
distorted

1434
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
then obviously this is something that

1435
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,559
would parallelize the market immediately

1436
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,079
because if you cannot trust the ticker

1437
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,000
on your screen anymore then you cannot

1438
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,040
transact

1439
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,880
and just give a very very you know it

1440
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,720
was a very basic uh

1441
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,640
attack but you know the syrian

1442
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,280
electronic army in april 2013

1443
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,119
they managed to penetrate an information

1444
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,240
system and put out the news that that uh

1445
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,680
obama had been attacked in the white

1446
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,839
house it lasted you know a couple of

1447
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,480
minutes

1448
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,000
but still it was enough to bring it down

1449
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,319
146 points down and cost

1450
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,599
at a cost of 140 billion so um

1451
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,400
now last minute on political intent and

1452
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,319
i think this is the big big

1453
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,960
question most as i said participants in

1454
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,720
the markets do know that vulnerability

1455
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,160
exist and that the ability

1456
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,880
to exploit them would also the question

1457
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,319
is the intent

1458
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,319
and here i would just say that you know

1459
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,480
the logic reminds me a lot to norman

1460
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
angel before the first world war who

1461
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,119
said

1462
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,559
it can't happen because we're too much

1463
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,079
interconnected i think we know that

1464
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:20,960
story

1465
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,200
i also think that when it comes to we

1466
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,040
are still quite bad at reading

1467
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,440
people's national security interests uh

1468
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,040
yeah i found it very interesting couple

1469
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,160
of weeks ago the

1470
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,720
front page of the economist uh said that

1471
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,319
taiwan was probably the most dangerous

1472
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,440
place in the world

1473
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,800
but from a financial market that's

1474
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
completely invisible i mean taiwan stock

1475
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,680
exchange is at all-time highs

1476
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
the taiwan dollars at an all-time

1477
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,280
strength because of the strong demand

1478
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,880
for the semiconductor so you do see that

1479
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,480
the financial market is not pricing in

1480
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,200
that

1481
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,640
that risk at all and

1482
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,119
various other aspects that i think are

1483
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,800
quite important to take into account

1484
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,960
but given that the time is up i will

1485
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,119
finish here

1486
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,559
so bobby thank you very much there's an

1487
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,640
excellent brief uh happy that you were

1488
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,839
able to uh cut us

1489
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,480
off in time to take a couple questions

1490
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,920
uh the first question

1491
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,800
uh deals with dr harry and dr vivek's

1492
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,599
paper

1493
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,800
uh the question is do you think we rely

1494
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,319
on single vendors to provide

1495
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,240
capabilities that can be attacked

1496
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,240
which has a cascading effect across

1497
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,559
multiple air services and sites

1498
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,400
should the mandated redundant resilience

1499
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,520
strategy be implemented

1500
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,200
yeah no thank you for the for the

1501
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,559
question um

1502
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,359
it's a real challenge um what from our

1503
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,040
from our analysis we were able to

1504
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,240
identify

1505
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,480
uh several kind of individual points of

1506
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,520
failure

1507
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,319
uh which you know really bodes a

1508
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,160
significant concern for commercial

1509
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,040
aviation

1510
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,119
um i i think this is an area and

1511
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,079
certainly what the binding

1512
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,520
administration is now is trying to

1513
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,440
explore with pipeline security

1514
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
is that there needs to be greater uh

1515
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,559
oversight

1516
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,800
of kind of what these kind of societal

1517
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
consequences are for attacks on private

1518
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,960
infrastructure so i think it makes an

1519
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,319
awful lot of sense

1520
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,359
for system to more deeply understand uh

1521
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,680
this kind of set of uh interconnections

1522
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,440
and and to bobby's point about the the

1523
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,000
financial

1524
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,559
infrastructure i think it carries over

1525
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,400
not just for our infrastructure but for

1526
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,440
some of these other

1527
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
national critical functions

1528
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,400
well thank you very much uh very

1529
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,160
insightful

1530
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,680
next question we'll go to our second

1531
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,280
paper uh for

1532
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,079
uh and the question is entitled do you

1533
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,680
have ideas on how the

1534
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,319
to scan or the analysis methods that can

1535
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,280
be enhanced

1536
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,319
for your work is it an example uh isn't

1537
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,319
a realistic example to get any sorts of

1538
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,000
metrics on the critical

1539
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,240
criticality of vulnerable services

1540
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,079
yeah that's a very good question thank

1541
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,000
you very much so yeah so

1542
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,440
though we have also legal problems in

1543
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,520
the end so yes of course we could make

1544
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,920
more intense scans in a way that we

1545
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,520
could try to exploit or

1546
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,799
that we could try to uh make

1547
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,960
stronger scams in the end that maybe has

1548
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,000
much more impact on the

1549
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,720
system and that's exactly the barrier so

1550
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,240
by law we are not able

1551
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
and we are not allowed to try to

1552
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,599
circumvent any

1553
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,880
security barrier at all that's why we

1554
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,760
only

1555
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,920
are able to to select the service and

1556
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,359
the banner information and then to map

1557
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,960
it to vulnerabilities

1558
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,720
but there are also other types we have

1559
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,000
not done uh

1560
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,920
for the for the hospital so we could

1561
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,200
also do some more open source

1562
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,960
intelligence in a way that we could look

1563
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,599
for

1564
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,119
employees email addresses of the

1565
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,720
employee that we could also look for

1566
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,400
passwords our passwords leaked from

1567
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,520
these employees

1568
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,680
using their company email address and so

1569
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,440
on we could also look at there may be

1570
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,400
some

1571
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,079
social networks some very interesting

1572
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,000
informations about maybe some management

1573
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,440
or it administrators

1574
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,400
so the the attack area for hospitals is

1575
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,079
much more higher than only network

1576
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:52,720
services

1577
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,400
that's also the human being and that was

1578
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
on not part of our

1579
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,240
of our research but that's also

1580
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,839
something that attackers in the past

1581
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,640
have used very often

1582
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,160
johannes thank you very much for that

1583
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,319
quick answer uh we'll have one more uh

1584
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,000
question uh this one will be for our

1585
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,680
last presenter bobby

1586
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,160
how can one judge the shift in intent

1587
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,920
that would occur in a situation

1588
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,839
that would result in open conflict

1589
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,480
well i think it's uh it's uh you know as

1590
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,599
a market

1591
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,760
participant myself i think one of the

1592
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,000
key questions is always

1593
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,680
the same way as we look at the security

1594
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,680
you know what what is the market pricing

1595
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,240
and what

1596
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,880
is the is is the real value of something

1597
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,480
and i think the key question here is

1598
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,119
that

1599
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,599
at the moment the problem is that intent

1600
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,880
at least from a

1601
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,119
is is valued at zero and and i just

1602
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,559
don't think it's zero at all

1603
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,119
um you know they we we are in the west

1604
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,079
quite bad at

1605
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,760
judging the criticality uh sometimes of

1606
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,799
um of uh of other states uh

1607
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,240
of of certain geopolitical issues

1608
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,880
and so all i think what is critical here

1609
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,920
is to understand

1610
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,760
that that we shouldn't assume that it's

1611
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,520
zero because that's what history tells

1612
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,680
us or that it is very low uh

1613
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,880
the intent um and we should assume that

1614
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,839
that given our high way higher degree of

1615
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,280
vulnerability

1616
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,280
what would we do if the financial system

1617
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,960
is brought down

1618
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,359
how can we keep the um the the real

1619
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,319
economy

1620
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,000
operating and in one conversation with

1621
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,079
the regulator um

1622
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,839
he was like well you know we are too

1623
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,920
digitized right now and nothing can be

1624
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,960
done

1625
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,720
which was very different to for example

1626
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,079
the statement of the central bank of

1627
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,079
sweden in 2018

1628
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,559
which said that obviously one had to be

1629
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,280
ready

1630
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,799
to almost go manual in finance again

1631
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,400
and and i think this is where the

1632
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,839
conversation between the financial and

1633
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,920
the military sector is so interesting

1634
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,599
because like there are various ideas

1635
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,280
obviously but you could use

1636
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,480
um in an emergency for example the the

1637
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,760
military as effectively um

1638
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,799
a commercial banking network um

1639
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,119
to literally just allow the real economy

1640
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,640
to continue operating

1641
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,599
um main point from my side is just that

1642
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,000
these

1643
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,520
the question needs to be discussed and

1644
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,119
not just seen as a technical issue

1645
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:11,760
because again

1646
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,359
for the structural issues that i

1647
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,920
mentioned before there is no national or

1648
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,760
supranational regulator who can change

1649
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,520
that the system is what it is

1650
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,520
and the key question is just like what

1651
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,880
happens if the system

1652
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,640
get brought down because our

1653
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,000
vulnerability is clearly

1654
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,640
way higher than any of our adversarial

1655
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,879
states

1656
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,799
so gentlemen uh thank you very much i

1657
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,319
think we'll conclude this panel there's

1658
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,000
a lot of really good information and i

1659
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,280
was happy that we were able to get some

1660
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,480
questions but uh

1661
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,640
thank you for your participation and

1662
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:51,790
that's all we have for right now

1663
00:58:51,790 --> 00:59:01,599
[Music]

1664
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,680
you
