2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
good afternoon from thailand to everyone

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,119
a very well welcome to the panel

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
entitled great power competition in the

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,960
new decade

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
my name is pirat bernick and i'm a

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,640
researcher at the strategy

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
strategy branch at the ccdcoe

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
it's my great pleasure to moderate this

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,520
panel

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
with two distinguished scholars

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
professor martin libiki

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
and jason blessing

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
unfortunately our first speaker could

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,239
not join us

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
today to do an unexpected family

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,559
emergency

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,680
and we wish him and his family a quick

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
recovery and well the good news is

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
that after two presentations we will

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,719
have more

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
time for discussion and i

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
encourage everyone to as usual to

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,119
submit your questions via a chat box

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,920
and also you don't have to um

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
limit yourself to the papers but take

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
the opportunity

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,000
to ask our experts about broader

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,720
issues regarding the great power power

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,080
competition

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
concerning emerging and disruptive

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
technologies and military cyber power

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
so uh the first paper in this session is

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
co-authored

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
by professor libiki and david compart

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
and it's about quantum communications

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,799
and its usefulness for both high and low

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,360
end

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,119
cyber security and the second paper

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
authored by dr blessing presents results

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
of a unique

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
database on global military cyber forces

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
and offers a new typology

44
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,000
of organizational model models and scale

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
of command and both themes

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
are directly relevant to our discussions

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
as this summer nato will be issuing

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
new strategies on ai and data

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,239
as well as the renewal of

50
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
implementation strategy of its emerging

51
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,879
and disruptive

52
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,800
technologies roadmap which was first

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
published in february 2001

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,720
and also it's renewing as we heard

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
yesterday from david van ville

56
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,680
it's cyber defense policy which has

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
implications for the allied cyber

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
space capabilities so now i will

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
introduce our speakers and

60
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,640
by the way you can access their full

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
bios at the

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
conference web page so

63
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
professor libiki uh holds the kaiser

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,599
chair of cyber security studies at the

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,560
u.s

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
naval academy and his author of several

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
textbooks on cyber war and

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,040
other cyberspace relevant issues as well

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,680
as

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
he has also contributed six

72
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
articles to our own proceedings

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
a very warm welcome professor libiki

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
and our second speaker dr

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
jason blessing is a post-doctoral

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
fellow at john hopkins school of

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
studies welcome jason to you as well

81
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,000
and without further ado i propose as we

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
now have more time you both would

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
have your presentations and after that

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,040
we will

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,519
take the questions have a discussion

86
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,080
with

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
the whole panel so with that

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,400
over to you professor libikin

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,199
all right good thank you for that warm

90
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,160
introduction

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
good afternoon good morning and a

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,839
special shout out

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,120
to the midshipmen um

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
let's talk about let's talk about an

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
approach to

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
a new technology here and we're going to

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
start off with a background slide

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,080
and i suspect after several days here no

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
the one before that

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
sorry no no excuse me you're right

101
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
you're right you're right

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
that one good um this is stuff that you

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,240
probably spent several days

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
talking about and i'll just summarize

105
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
the points really quickly

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,199
when you have an epidemic that a

107
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,120
pandemic that keeps a lot of folks at

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
home people have to access

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
workspaces from their home generally

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
speaking

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
home computers tend to be less secure

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
the requirement that people be connected

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
in order to do any work

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
goes up this creates potential

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
vulnerabilities

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
when you have potential vulnerabilities

117
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
you have cyber criminals

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
state actors etc taking advantage of the

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
vulnerabilities

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
this makes cyber security more difficult

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
but the point

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,880
i want to get to is uh the belief

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
that cyber security investments are no

124
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,560
longer

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
as cost effective as they used to be

126
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
they are insufficiently cost effective

127
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
the world spends a minimal minimum of

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
about a hundred billion dollars a year

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
on cyber security the problem isn't

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
going away

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
for all intents and purposes it's

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
getting worse

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,639
and when you have a problem like that

134
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
where the current technologies

135
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
don't give you the kind of relief that

136
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,639
you're hoping to get

137
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
there is a tendency to look for new

138
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
technologies

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
and the new technology that a lot of

140
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
people have in mind

141
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,039
for information technology for it uses

142
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,720
is quantum okay now

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
you may ask yourself what is quantum

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
what is quantum physics

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
and if you take a look at the next slide

146
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,280
which is taken from the new yorker

147
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
i don't know how well you can read this

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
but this nurse is telling dr schradinger

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,319
about your cat dr schradinger

150
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
i have good news and bad news well those

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
of you who understand it will need an

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
explanation from me

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
and those of you who don't understand it

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
um

155
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
i don't have time for an explanation and

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,319
i'm probably not very good at it anyway

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
so just take my word for it this stuff

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
is strange so let's go to the next slide

159
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
where we talk about the technology in

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
particular

161
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,080
when we talk about quantum technologies

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,599
in the world of i.t

163
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
there are actually three related

164
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,880
technologies

165
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
one of which ironically

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
creates a need for the other one those

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
con technologies are

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
quantum sensing quantum computation

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,800
and quantum communications the one that

170
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
you may have heard about a lot is

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
quantum

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
quantum computing in 1994

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,199
dr short from i believe the bell labs

174
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
basically argued

175
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
convincingly that if you had a quantum

176
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
computer

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
you could crack prime numbers you can

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
otherwise you could factor

179
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,319
a large number into its component primes

180
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,720
in

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
polynomial time rather than exponential

182
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,080
time

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
and if you could do that successfully

184
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
you would be able

185
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
to essentially crack the key

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,199
to asymmetric encryption

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
asymmetric encryption for the most part

188
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
has relied on prime numbers and has

189
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
relied on the difficulty

190
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
sort of a logarithmic exponential

191
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,639
difficulty

192
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,520
of factoring prime numbers if you go

193
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,000
from an

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
exponential difficulty to a polynomial

195
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,599
difficulty

196
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,720
then all of a sudden it becomes possible

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
not only for nation states but for

198
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
anybody who can afford a quantum

199
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,199
computer

200
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
to be able to crack asymmetric

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,319
technology

202
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
which in turn undermines symmetric

203
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
practology because asymmetric cryptology

204
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
is one of the ways used for passing keys

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,720
for

206
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
symmetric cryptology and that's

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
basically the backbone

208
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,159
backbone of all secret communications

209
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,440
okay but as it turns out quantum physics

210
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,000
has another

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,719
trick up its sleeve and that's called

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
quantum communications now the reason

213
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
for that other trick up

214
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,279
its sleeve is that while prime numbers

215
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
are not the only

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
possible way

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
to do asymmetric encryption um

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,839
people have talked about elliptical

219
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
curves for instance

220
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
there is no guarantee that

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880
these alternatives to prime numbers

222
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
are themselves not crackable in many

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
ways dr

224
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
shore did the world of favor by

225
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
basically saying hey

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
if you're going to have quantum

227
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
computers you can't rely on prime

228
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,399
numbers

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
to keep a secret the problem is not

230
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
with him the problem is with the next

231
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
doctor sure who may find ways of

232
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
cracking what we

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
think are quantum resistant encryption

234
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,480
methods

235
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
but don't publish the results okay

236
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,160
so the question about whether some

237
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
future algorithm some future encryption

238
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,519
method

239
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
is going to protect our secrets is an

240
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,920
open one with quantum communications

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,959
however

242
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,720
you have a completely different approach

243
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
to cryptology

244
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,080
accordingly it is understood within the

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
world of quantum physics

246
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
that you can provably detect whether

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,440
a bit stream has been examined

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
by a third party okay now

249
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,640
i don't want to get into an argument

250
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
about what the word provably means

251
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
but let's accept that it's as face value

252
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,240
because it involves

253
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,120
physics and not mathematics which means

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
it goes through a really different logic

255
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,519
chain

256
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
and what that means is if you could

257
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
probably know

258
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
that you have sent the message and it

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
hasn't been read you can use

260
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
this method to send

261
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
symmetric keys because symmetric keys

262
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
even though they're extremely difficult

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,720
to crack

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,839
at the same time have a primary weakness

265
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,160
and that's the key distribution function

266
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
particularly when you're communicating

267
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
over an open medium

268
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,040
quantum key distribution the very the

269
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
same technologies can also be used for

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
sending short messages

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
now one can go into a sort of a long

272
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
exegesis about

273
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
how do you know that the message how do

274
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,079
you communicate that the message

275
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,839
has in fact been read has been sent and

276
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,240
not

277
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,959
read reliably and the answer is you

278
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,839
don't

279
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
okay you don't have to do that what you

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
can do is you can take the first

281
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
unread message and that use that

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
use those bits as part of a bid stream

283
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
to encode further messages using

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
something like xor

285
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
methods or something comparable okay

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,800
and without going to a large amount of

287
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
explanation this is a relatively

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
reliable method for passing messages

289
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
back and forth

290
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
not only messages having to do with

291
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
quantum key distribution

292
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
not only messages having to do with key

293
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
distribution but short otherwise

294
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
critical messages

295
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
okay but note this is a very different

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
form of encryption

297
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
than the one that we're used to we're

298
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
used to basically saying

299
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
i have sent a message to you

300
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
i don't know whether it's intercepted

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
but i know it doesn't make a difference

302
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,160
because if you can't crack the key

303
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
here you're sending a message and you're

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
saying it might be intercepted but i'll

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,079
know that

306
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
okay but if it isn't intercepted i will

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
also know that and then i can use that

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,000
message

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
for further communications now

310
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
this i'm gonna argue

311
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,519
in this slide the rest of the slide in

312
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
the next slide is not the be all and end

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
all of cyber security

314
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
because what you often have in cyber

315
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
security is a particularly elegant

316
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,000
solution

317
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,639
to a problem but the problem is not the

318
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,519
entire problem that you're dealing with

319
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
okay so in this case if you take a look

320
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
at how people intercept messages how

321
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,040
people crack

322
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
systems it turns out you're looking for

323
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
vulnerabilities

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,440
whether vulnerabilities in code or

325
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
vulnerabilities in how things are

326
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
processed

327
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
throughout the entire chain from the

328
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
integrity and trustworthiness of a

329
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,680
recipient

330
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
of the sender to the integrity and

331
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
trustworthiness of the receiver

332
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
the machines that they work on the um

333
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
intermediate nodes that they work on etc

334
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,800
all i can do

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,600
with quantum key distribution is to make

336
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,240
sure that

337
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
once a message leaves my

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,480
machine it is not intercepted

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
i will know whether or not it's

340
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
intercepted when it arrives at the other

341
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,279
machine

342
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
okay now from this you have to work your

343
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
way backwards to a problem

344
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
remember that we already have more or

345
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
less adequate

346
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,279
methods for ensuring that a bit stream

347
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,959
cannot be read by the other side okay

348
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,440
what we're worried about are not your

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
common everyday criminals

350
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,199
what we're worried about are state

351
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
actors that can

352
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,199
intercept the physics of the physical

353
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,160
manifestation of the bit stream and

354
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
decrypt it

355
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,279
at the same time when you talk about

356
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
quantum key distribution

357
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,399
you're talking about something fairly

358
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,920
expensive so let's go to the next slide

359
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,399
and

360
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,680
pick up the points that we have there

361
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
okay

362
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
okay so it won't solve everything we're

363
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
taking a look at those communications

364
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,320
that are imperiled

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,279
by state actors largely state actors

366
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
and we are talking about a currently

367
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
expensive process

368
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,959
but it's i would say essential to

369
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,959
understanding cyber security

370
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,040
to understand that different markets

371
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
have different needs okay

372
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
the needs of the everyday user are

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
different in scope and type

374
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,880
than the needs of people who run

375
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
telecommunications companies

376
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
are different in scope and type than the

377
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
needs of people who run power plants

378
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
let's go to the next slide i think that

379
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,199
makes it a little clearer here

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,399
um are different than militaries

381
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:18,880
different

382
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,519
hospitals different from banks different

383
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,320
energy pro

384
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
providers and so on okay each of them

385
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,560
has a different suite of adversaries

386
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
each of them has advertisers they're

387
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
looking for something

388
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
and each of them have different things

389
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,519
they have to protect alluding to the

390
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
previous presentation

391
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,639
okay we talk about protecting

392
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,040
confidentiality

393
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,000
integrity and availability but in some

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
cases

395
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
confidentiality is your most important

396
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
product and in other cases

397
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
it's integrity and yet in other cases

398
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
it's availability

399
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
so between the differences in the

400
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,959
threats

401
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,079
the type of things that you want to

402
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,240
protect and the differences in threat

403
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
actors

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,320
whereas there's commonalities there are

405
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
also very

406
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,759
large differences and is the existence

407
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,360
of these large differences

408
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
which give a technology such as quantum

409
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,199
key distribution

410
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
and in the other quantum communications

411
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
applications

412
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
a chance to grow and thrive okay

413
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,199
now if we leave it at that we would

414
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,399
solve

415
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,600
a fraction of a problem

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
that occurs to a fraction of the

417
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,519
community

418
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,639
the question is if we get that right

419
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
and so far with the experimental stage

420
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
to know that it's feasible

421
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,880
do we leave it go with that okay and

422
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,600
there are three or

423
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
three alternatives i would say if the

424
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
question is okay we have an expensive

425
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
technology for expensive uses

426
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,600
how do we get this down market the three

427
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
options are

428
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
one it's not going to go down market

429
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
it's not going to go

430
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
to where the everyday citizen can take

431
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
direct advantage of it

432
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
but that's okay but that's okay the

433
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,799
second one

434
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,799
is that it will go down market on its

435
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,039
own and the third one

436
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,520
is that it should go down market but we

437
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
can't count on it to go down market on

438
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,319
its own

439
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
and maybe it needs a little push okay so

440
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
let's take a look at the next slide

441
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,319
okay there are a lot of technologies

442
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,440
that go down market okay

443
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,039
um and there's grounds for believing

444
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
that quantum cryptology

445
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
where quantum technologies in general

446
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
will not go down market

447
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
when 1994 when shore wrote his algorithm

448
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
it was believed in the technology

449
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,000
community that quantum computing

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
was just around the corner here it is 27

451
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,240
years later

452
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
quantum computing has made a great deal

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
of progress

454
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
but it's still just around the corner

455
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,280
okay and i'm not going to say that it's

456
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
never going to happen

457
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
but i am going to say it's taken place

458
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
at a lot slower rate

459
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
than a lot of people expected 25 years

460
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,120
ago

461
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,480
why because the engineering

462
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
for quantum is extremely finicky you

463
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,000
have to get

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
a lot of things right by contrast

465
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
whereas

466
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
you get finicky technologies in all the

467
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
other domains

468
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
in all the other domains we've managed

469
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,799
to

470
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,080
take a finicky process and apply it

471
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
to more and more each's okay

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
the technologies for instance for making

473
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,120
integrated circuits

474
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
are of anything much more complicated

475
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,559
than they were

476
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,440
25 30 40 years ago but each transistor

477
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
is now far far cheaper than it was

478
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
because we've taken the same

479
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
um finicky technologies and applied them

480
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,360
over an

481
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,080
ever increasing n or n is the number of

482
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,760
transistors or if you're talking gene

483
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,559
splices

484
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,480
i mean reading genetic sequences

485
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
n is a number of genes that you can

486
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
sequence for a given process

487
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
okay so in many ways that's how we go

488
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,720
down market

489
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
but there are a lot of reasons to

490
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
believe that quantum physics

491
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,720
may resist that trend on the other hand

492
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
there are lots of technologies that

493
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
never go down market

494
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,559
and we managed to get increasing use out

495
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
of them one of them for instance is

496
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,039
rocketry

497
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
the cost of getting a pound of stuff

498
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
into space

499
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
between essentially the 1980s

500
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,200
and until recently did not go down

501
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
but because electronics were shrinking

502
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,640
we were able to get more and more usage

503
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
out of a technology that did not get

504
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,919
cheaper and cheaper

505
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,960
okay the parallel here would be that

506
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,559
as more and more of us can take

507
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,640
advantage of cloud computing

508
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,679
the fact that we don't own

509
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,919
clouds individuals don't own clouds and

510
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,960
never will

511
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,559
doesn't necessarily mean that

512
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,679
individuals cannot profit

513
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,120
from advances in the field of clouds

514
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
okay so that's one option the second

515
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
option

516
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
um in next slide

517
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,120
is to say um

518
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
that it's going to go down market on its

519
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,039
own okay we've already seen with

520
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,120
integrated circuits and genetics

521
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
genetic basically reading the genome

522
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,400
that in fact that capability exists

523
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
but even if you look at yesterday's

524
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,480
technology such as cars and planes and

525
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
appliances and even out of season

526
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
produce

527
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,080
you see a steady progression from

528
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
technologies that only

529
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,600
institutions and the affluent to afford

530
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,880
to technologies that everyone can afford

531
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
okay and that's been a general trend

532
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
throughout the 20th and into the 21st

533
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,760
century

534
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,640
okay so the down market is not going to

535
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
be from the rich to the poor in this

536
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,880
case

537
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,080
but from powerful well-funded sensitive

538
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
institutions to those which are

539
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
competitive

540
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
parsimonious which means they don't have

541
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
a lot of money and less sensitive

542
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
so again we can talk about cloud-based

543
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
security managed services

544
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
multi-factor security okay that having

545
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,799
been said

546
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
there's going to be a lot in cyber

547
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
security that does not go down market

548
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
for the reasons that i suggest it that

549
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
is to say you have say in the

550
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
intelligence community

551
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
a set of unique problems that are not

552
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
experienced

553
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
in the rest of the world so that the

554
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
solutions to the intelligence community

555
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
have little applicability to the rest of

556
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
us okay

557
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,159
the next slide is essentially going to

558
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
be talking about a third option

559
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,039
which is to say to push it downstream

560
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,480
and

561
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
here i'm going to completely using a

562
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,039
baseball metaphor

563
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,520
spitball the next thing i'm going to say

564
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
and that is

565
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
if you can find some way

566
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
and don't ask me how of taking these

567
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,679
quantum

568
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
technologies and putting them on the

569
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,360
chip level

570
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,559
you not only have a path to

571
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
a steadily decreasing cost

572
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
but you also have a path to a much

573
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
broader set of set of uses

574
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
and in this way the technologies of

575
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
quantum sensing

576
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
and quantum communications can start to

577
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,320
converge

578
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,679
but that's all i want to say on the

579
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,120
topic because like i said i'm

580
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
spitballing okay

581
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,919
what are the tools for getting things

582
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,400
down market they're all the usual tools

583
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
research and development concentrated

584
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
purchases

585
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,120
regulation standardization tools that

586
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
people know very well

587
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
okay so what's the bottom line on this

588
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,200
on the last chart

589
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,880
and that is quantum communications is an

590
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
exciting technologies

591
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,320
it has niche applications today

592
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
but it might have more applications in

593
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,760
time and on that

594
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,600
i pass the microphone thank you so much

595
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,240
martin

596
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,799
um especially for explaining in

597
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,000
non-technical language

598
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,799
what the quantum communication is about

599
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,280
so

600
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,400
even policy people

601
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
can understand and of course the paper

602
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,840
is much

603
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,760
more richer than you were able to cover

604
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,320
but

605
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,039
i just before we go to jason i just

606
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,080
wanted to

607
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
ask something that

608
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,039
was in the paper regarding how to use

609
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,520
quantum communications for securing

610
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
wireless

611
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
typing and you mentioned that

612
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,799
as the technology advances and and

613
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,360
integrated circuits and chips become

614
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
minimized so we saw this happening

615
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,159
and now we have all cell phones and iot

616
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
uh devices so i think in the paper you

617
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
also a reference that this could happen

618
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,919
in the

619
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
future and i was wondering if you could

620
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,240
a little bit elaborate on that

621
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,570
that would did you mean that

622
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,640
[Laughter]

623
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
we could use uh quantum communications

624
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,000
for

625
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,279
for example securing uh sensing and

626
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
and computing in the edge

627
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,840
did i understand correctly thank you

628
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
well look i hate to be a disappointment

629
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
here but it's really speculation on my

630
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:23,840
part

631
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,840
it's not more of a it's it's more of a

632
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
necessary condition than a sufficient

633
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
condition in other words if there was

634
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
ways to do it it would open a lot of

635
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
opportunities i can't prove that you

636
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
couldn't do it but i'm holding

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,679
out a speculation that you might be able

638
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,200
to do it okay

639
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
one of the problems of quantum

640
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,360
communications as currently implemented

641
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
and is necessarily implemented is that

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
it takes an extremely clean medium

643
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
so that all the other interferences

644
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,960
on that passing of a bit or a photon

645
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,120
can be are nullified out

646
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,679
okay and then you're basically saying

647
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,520
okay i know i've gotten rid of all the

648
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,400
interferences any other interference is

649
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,840
evidence of interception

650
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,760
um

651
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,559
how exactly this goes away when you talk

652
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,080
about

653
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,080
working at the uh at that ship level

654
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,679
i can only speculate so i apologize for

655
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,720
that

656
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,039
thank you that was very interesting and

657
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
we have to look forward so

658
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,880
uh but as uh we are running uh

659
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
soon out of time we now move on

660
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,760
uh to jason and after that we come back

661
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,200
to martin as well with more questions on

662
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,520
the

663
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,880
policy side and how to actually

664
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
implement those brilliant

665
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
recommendations in your paper

666
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,240
jason the floor is yours please

667
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,559
well thank you very much for having me

668
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,080
and thank you for the introduction

669
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
earlier and hello to you all

670
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,159
i'm looking forward to discussing my

671
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
paper on the global spread of cyber

672
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
forces from 2000 to 2018.

673
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
there are two motivating questions

674
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
behind this paper

675
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
the first is how have military cyber

676
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
forces spread over time

677
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
and how have they been structured so

678
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
essentially what is the state of play

679
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
with regard to formal organizations for

680
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,159
cyber capabilities

681
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
now why should this matter for nato

682
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,799
there are three primary reasons

683
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,080
but this boils down to the fact that

684
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
the data suggests it is past time to

685
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
update the strategic concept with

686
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
regards to cyberspace

687
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,559
in fact the 2010 strategic concept only

688
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,919
mentions cyberspace

689
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,440
five times additionally as recommended

690
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
by the nato 2030

691
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,480
group should the alliance undertake

692
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
comprehensive net assessment efforts

693
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,559
cyber forces necessarily need to be part

694
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,400
of this conversation

695
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
so by cyber forces this paper defines

696
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,520
them

697
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
as active duty military organizations

698
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,480
with the capability and authority

699
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,799
to direct and control strategic

700
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
cyberspace operations

701
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,039
to influence diplomatic and or military

702
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,039
interactions

703
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,000
while previous studies have restricted

704
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,799
their

705
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,880
scope to those that possess offensive

706
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,159
capabilities

707
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,760
this paper takes a little bit broader

708
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
review and incorporates defensive

709
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
exploitation uh and attack operations

710
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,799
importantly this excludes three types of

711
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,120
organizations with similar missions

712
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
the first is civilian intelligence

713
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,880
agencies like the united states national

714
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
security agency

715
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,039
despite significant overlap in the types

716
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
of operations they conduct

717
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
civilian organizations fall outside

718
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
military chains of command

719
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
and tend to prioritize information

720
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
collection over gaining strategic

721
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,080
advantages on the battlefield

722
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
second this also excludes purely

723
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,200
reservist components

724
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
as their activation is conditional on uh

725
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,760
legal activation and they're also much

726
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,480
more fluid

727
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
and substantial volunteering

728
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,000
requirements are that's an assumption

729
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
unlikely to hold across militaries

730
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
finally this includes

731
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,559
or excludes military computer emergency

732
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,480
readiness teams incident response teams

733
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,679
etc

734
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,679
as they tend to work defensively at the

735
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,120
tactical level

736
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
while they can be under the control of

737
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
or report to cyber forces

738
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,039
in and of themselves so they do not

739
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,240
constitute cyber forces

740
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
so the natural question is then why

741
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
force structure

742
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
well on the one hand force structure

743
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
helps to shape the trade-off

744
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,200
of exploitation versus disruption in

745
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
cyberspace

746
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,120
for example those cyber forces that are

747
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,799
traditionally rooted within military

748
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,240
intelligence circles

749
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,960
may have a preference for exploitation

750
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,600
while those originating in service-based

751
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,760
constructs may have a preference for

752
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,679
disruption in cyberspace and producing

753
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,200
effects

754
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
additionally academics and practitioners

755
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
hold many assumptions about military

756
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,799
emulation

757
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
i.e the tendency for military

758
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,720
organizations to conform to a

759
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
predominant

760
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
organizational construct over time

761
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,679
unfortunately

762
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,200
this assumption leaves us without an

763
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,640
appropriate terminology for

764
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,080
understanding the spread of cyber

765
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,360
forces and indeed by referring to

766
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,000
all institutional arraignments at cyber

767
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
commands

768
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,279
this masks important variation in the

769
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,039
scope roles and responsibilities in

770
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,159
cyberspace

771
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,480
if we use cyber command to refer to u.s

772
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,919
cyber command

773
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,919
as well as any other institution

774
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,120
there are going to be differences that

775
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
are masked and finally

776
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
existing research has focused more on

777
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,480
the degrees of organizational maturity

778
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
for cyber forces

779
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
single case studies or limited case

780
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
comparisons of force structure

781
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
as such we lack large in cross-national

782
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,559
data for comparison over time

783
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
there are several challenges however to

784
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,559
assess enforce structure

785
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,559
in cyberspace many of the traditional

786
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
categories become problematic

787
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
first unlike unit functions in other

788
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,720
domains such as

789
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,279
aircraft carriers submarines long-range

790
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,360
bombers tanks

791
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,200
the operational functions in the cyber

792
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,679
domain can be nearly indistinguishable

793
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,120
in this sense it doesn't really make

794
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
sense to talk in terms of

795
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
defensive and offensive units for

796
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,320
cyberspace or defensive and offensive

797
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,559
capabilities because attacking and

798
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,320
defending one's own network

799
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
can rely on intrusions into an

800
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,679
adversary's network for intelligence

801
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,320
collection

802
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
that would make defense much more

803
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,240
effective additionally

804
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,559
these operations exploitation defense

805
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,440
and attack

806
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,799
also use similar tools and techniques

807
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,120
second the weaponry is different instead

808
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
of tangible weapon systems such as

809
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,279
missiles tanks submarines

810
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,440
that have multiple usability and are

811
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
quantifiable

812
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
weapons in the cyber domain are largely

813
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,240
digital

814
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
contain transitory elements that only

815
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,240
have a temporary ability to access and

816
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
attack computer networks and systems

817
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,760
these capabilities also have the

818
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
potential to rapidly diffuse to others

819
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
and can be modified and redeployed

820
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
third while total personnel can be

821
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
quantified to some degree

822
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,159
there's no clear distinction between

823
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,320
direct combat and indirect support

824
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,399
personnel in the cyber domain

825
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,960
indeed indirect roles such as signals

826
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,159
intelligence

827
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,039
are directly at the heart of operations

828
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,360
for

829
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,640
direct personnel in cyber forces

830
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,760
and finally data across countries is

831
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
at best inconsistently documented and at

832
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:50,799
worst

833
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,080
classified on force structure therefore

834
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,880
this paper proposes two main dimensions

835
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,279
for

836
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,360
assessing force structure and these are

837
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,799
organizational model

838
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,000
and scale of command

839
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
so this slide presents the typology

840
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,679
proposed in the paper

841
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,799
with the two main dimensions in the

842
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,480
first column uh

843
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,120
are organizational models while the rows

844
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,519
are scale of command

845
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,039
so all the way on the left there are

846
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
three possible uh values for

847
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,159
organizational models three options

848
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,200
uh under a branch model such as the

849
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
estonian cyber command

850
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,679
authority for cyberspace rests in

851
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,919
primarily logistical branches

852
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,320
military intelligence agencies signal

853
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
corps

854
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,679
any organization that falls outside

855
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,240
service department chains of command

856
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,919
their personnel are generally arranged

857
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,679
along functional lines their first

858
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,840
identification is not a combat service

859
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,559
second for the service model uh cyber

860
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,039
forces under this model

861
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,000
are organized when one single combat

862
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
service

863
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,159
such as an army a navy an air force

864
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
or in some cases a stand-alone cyber

865
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,200
service

866
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,799
such as germany's cyber information

867
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,960
domain service when a single service

868
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,000
retains the primary

869
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,799
authority for operations in these

870
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,679
instances

871
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,360
cyber force is only staffed by the

872
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
personnel from that combat service to

873
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,399
which it reports

874
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
and usually this force is grouped

875
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
according to functional

876
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,679
uh or component commands or service

877
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,320
level major commands

878
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,399
finally the third option under the

879
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,080
branch or excuse me under the

880
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,799
organizational model is a joint model

881
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,720
and this entails the shared distribution

882
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,880
of authority across two or more combat

883
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
services so for instance

884
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,039
a construct that entails cyber

885
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,640
operations jointly across

886
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
army air force and navies these joint

887
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,720
forces

888
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
rely on combat services for staffing and

889
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,559
funding

890
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
and this usually occurs on a short-term

891
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,279
rotational basis

892
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,200
if we look at the scales of command

893
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,519
running across the top of the table

894
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,279
actually beginning with unified forces

895
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
all the way to the right

896
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
these are independent branches services

897
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
or combatant commands

898
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,440
dedicated to cyber operations unified

899
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,399
forces have no

900
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,879
direct parent organization and instead

901
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,879
they report directly to the chiefs

902
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,760
ministers or secretaries of defense

903
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
moving to the left

904
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,280
sub-unified force structures are

905
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,239
generally specialized sub-organizations

906
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,760
treating cyber operations as an

907
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,918
independent mission set

908
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,480
these sub-unified forces will report to

909
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,760
unified commands

910
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,440
that are already established and finally

911
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,359
the last value moving again to the left

912
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
is subordinated cyber forces

913
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
and this appears when existing commands

914
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,639
tend to incorporate

915
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,280
cyberspace operations into existing

916
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
missions to support them and

917
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,159
attempts to enhance effectiveness these

918
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,399
generally report to subunified but in

919
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,399
rare cases unified parent commands

920
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,960
so to just briefly survey the findings

921
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,320
of the paper

922
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,720
they're broken up comparing nato member

923
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
states to the rest of the world non-nato

924
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
countries

925
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,240
the first slide represents the aggregate

926
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,800
and

927
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
relative growth of cyber forces

928
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,040
worldwide the graph on the left

929
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,280
portrays aggregate growth while the

930
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,160
graph on the right

931
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
shows the relative or percentage growth

932
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
within nato and outside of nato

933
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,040
worth noting in the left hand side of

934
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,359
the slide on the first graph

935
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,800
is that until 2004 there were only seven

936
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
cyber forces worldwide

937
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,920
these were the united states russia

938
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,720
china

939
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,400
israel north korea greece and thailand

940
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
each of whom had a cyber force prior to

941
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
the year 2000.

942
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,640
by 2018 however there were 61 cyber

943
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
forces worldwide

944
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
nato members accounted for 23 of these

945
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
61 forces

946
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,720
the graph on the right-hand side

947
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
provides a bit more context however

948
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
and what is immediately evident is that

949
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
cyber forces have emerged

950
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,440
at a much faster rate among nato member

951
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,320
states than among non-nato countries

952
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,880
and this is particularly clear from 2008

953
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
to 2018

954
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,760
where in 2008 for nato countries less

955
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,119
than 25 percent

956
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,000
of nato members had a cyber force uh by

957
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
2018

958
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
nearly 80 percent had developed a cyber

959
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,160
force among nato members

960
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,359
conversely it took until 2017

961
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,599
for more than 25 percent of non-nato

962
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,040
countries to develop a site

963
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,920
force so growth within nato member

964
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,440
states has occurred at a much quicker

965
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
rate

966
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,800
turning to trends in organizational

967
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
model

968
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,720
immediately you can see that in both

969
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
instances

970
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,680
within member states on the left and

971
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,000
outside of nato on the right

972
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,760
there has been increasing variation in

973
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,119
the organizational model used over time

974
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,040
while the branch model has been the most

975
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
extensively used organizational model in

976
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
both cases

977
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,400
the relative share of usage of that

978
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,839
model has declined over time

979
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,720
worth noting is that non-nato states on

980
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,560
the right-hand side have opted

981
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
more regularly for the service model at

982
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
a higher rate than nato member states

983
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,880
while in contrast nato members have used

984
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
the joint model more extensively than

985
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
non-nato states

986
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,119
however again worth emphasizing is that

987
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,200
as of 2018

988
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,839
no dominant organizational model has

989
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,480
emerged

990
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,079
turning now to scales of command and the

991
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
findings of the paper

992
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
as would be expected to a degree

993
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,599
subordinated commands

994
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,280
have been the most prevalent scale of

995
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
command over time

996
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,960
but again this has seen a relative

997
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,520
decrease in time as many existing cyber

998
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
forces

999
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
their scale of commands have been

1000
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
elevated within militaries

1001
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,560
however it's clear that on average a

1002
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,520
greater proportion of nato member forces

1003
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,400
were able to transition from

1004
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,520
subordinated

1005
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,920
commands into subunified and unified

1006
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,720
commands

1007
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,960
at a much faster rate than non-nato

1008
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
member cyber forces

1009
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,440
again we see nato members on the left

1010
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,400
and

1011
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,920
non-nato members on the right by 2018

1012
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,400
nearly 40 percent of nato cyber forces

1013
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,440
had transitioned

1014
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,160
into a unified command less than 20

1015
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,880
percent remained a subordinated command

1016
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,440
for non-nato cyber forces by 2018

1017
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
roughly half were a subordinated command

1018
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
and less than 20

1019
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,520
had implemented a unified command

1020
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,400
so briefly turning to some of the key

1021
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
empirical takeaways

1022
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,760
uh the most prevalent cyber force

1023
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,079
structure from the typology table

1024
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
previously introduced the the most

1025
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,200
prevalent is a subordinated branch

1026
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,160
however in both organizational model and

1027
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
scale of command

1028
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,480
increasing variation in force structure

1029
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
selection over time

1030
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,760
has led to a relative decline of the

1031
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,400
subordinated branch force structure

1032
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
this indicates that as cyber forces have

1033
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
increasingly been created

1034
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
and elevated within militaries uh this

1035
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
increasing variation means that no

1036
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
dominant paradigm has emerged

1037
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,839
our assumptions about military emulation

1038
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,760
and the emergence of a dominant paradigm

1039
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,720
do not hold up in this circumstance

1040
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
and therefore the evidence suggests that

1041
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
states have tended to tailor their cyber

1042
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,839
forces

1043
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,000
to their own respective political and

1044
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
military conditions

1045
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
the natural question is why has this

1046
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,520
variation occurred

1047
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
why are there these differences in force

1048
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,119
structure although

1049
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,440
for this particular paper this question

1050
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,680
is outside the scope

1051
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,720
there are some potential explanations

1052
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,440
uh most notably the joint models and

1053
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,160
unified scales of command on average

1054
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
uh they tend to require greater

1055
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,359
resources uh

1056
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,880
military and politically uh the for the

1057
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,440
nato

1058
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,680
member states cyber forces to utilize

1059
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
these at a faster rate

1060
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
it's not necessarily a surprise as the

1061
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
largest economies in the world are

1062
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,880
disproportionately represented within

1063
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,400
nato

1064
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,520
and finally as other research i've done

1065
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,760
indicates implementation is subjected to

1066
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,720
these local conditions

1067
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,200
countries have implemented cyber forces

1068
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
in ways that work for them

1069
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
uh indicating there's no dominant

1070
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,119
paradigm

1071
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,520
so with that uh i thank you for your

1072
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,880
time and i look forward to

1073
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,240
questions and discussion thank you so

1074
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,720
much

1075
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
uh jason for this and um

1076
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,040
i wanted to pick one issue uh you

1077
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,400
mentioned that the subordinate commands

1078
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,560
among nato nations have been replaced

1079
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,480
uh by um subunified or unified and we

1080
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,319
can see this trend and i was

1081
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,800
wondering if it's not um based on your

1082
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,400
research but if you could

1083
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,920
um elaborate on this based on your

1084
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,079
experience uh how does it

1085
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,880
affect the broader strategic environment

1086
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,400
and

1087
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,440
you mentioned there are a lot of

1088
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,359
institutional um political

1089
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,720
strategic considerations why nations

1090
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
opt for one or the other and

1091
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,520
i'm thinking uh could there be

1092
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,560
some kind of peer learning process

1093
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,520
because

1094
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,359
now then that we are more

1095
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,640
mainstreaming cyber operations into

1096
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
military planning

1097
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
we have chalk train we have cyber

1098
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,280
operations center

1099
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,119
we have regular exercises and

1100
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,480
gatherings of cyber commands exercises

1101
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,640
training etc so

1102
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,560
would you if you look at in the future

1103
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,240
and also in the context of

1104
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,480
you mentioned this division of labor

1105
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,520
which has been

1106
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
discussed all the time especially

1107
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
regarding the split of

1108
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,440
cyber command and nsa and

1109
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,200
for example if we look at the uh

1110
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,319
persistent engagement and in

1111
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,640
media there was a lot of speculation

1112
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,520
about

1113
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,000
dark side servers being taken down

1114
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
perhaps

1115
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,480
covertly by cyber command

1116
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000
so doesn't it

1117
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,359
seem to you that as

1118
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,520
the mandate of military cyber forces

1119
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,079
is moving more towards the what's

1120
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,880
traditional

1121
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,480
classical signal

1122
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,680
signal kind of rule

1123
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,119
that in this regard that also the move

1124
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,800
for towards unified

1125
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,440
command makes sense because when you

1126
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,079
delegate

1127
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,480
authority for operations to the lower

1128
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,280
levels

1129
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,960
uh it's it's possible to quickly re

1130
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,760
react and respond and also because

1131
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,200
our military and political decision

1132
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,560
makers

1133
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,240
are more comfortable uh in in doing so

1134
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,680
uh because the risk of cyber escalation

1135
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,400
is not considered as as severe as as

1136
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,520
before so

1137
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,839
if you could comment on that thank you

1138
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,119
absolutely thank you for those questions

1139
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,319
uh for the first

1140
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,119
in terms of the geostrategic environment

1141
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,880
and the effect

1142
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,280
so on one hand geostrategic pressures

1143
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,240
are an important impetus for

1144
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,319
establishing a cyber command or for

1145
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,560
obtaining the political capital needed

1146
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,760
at the domestic level

1147
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,040
to actually establish and implement or

1148
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,480
uh increase you know resources scale of

1149
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
command etc

1150
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,079
to existing cyber forces but

1151
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,160
geostrategic pressures alone

1152
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,400
cannot help you determine which force

1153
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,480
structure is right

1154
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,000
right for your specific political

1155
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,560
military geostrategic conditions etc

1156
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,680
uh and in this sense uh there is

1157
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,079
some peer learning that is taking place

1158
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,960
right

1159
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,000
uh most this is really mostly seen in

1160
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,920
uh from some of the other work that i've

1161
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,440
done uh

1162
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,480
in assessing the trade-offs for let's

1163
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,960
say there's a smaller country a smaller

1164
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
military power

1165
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
that is looking to establish a cyber

1166
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,839
force uh they have the ability to

1167
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,119
uh communicate and to conference with

1168
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,599
for example allies partners or other

1169
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,480
states

1170
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,040
to assess what the relative tradeoffs of

1171
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,240
a joint model

1172
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,480
a branch model or service model may be

1173
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,240
for their own military

1174
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,520
so it helps to the there is a role for

1175
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,160
peer learning to help reduce uncertainty

1176
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
over the opportunity cost of

1177
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
pursuing one route of force structure

1178
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,119
over the other

1179
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,160
uh and in in that sense so the

1180
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,319
moving towards the question of the

1181
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,480
mandate of military cyber forces

1182
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,960
uh yes there is this uh signals

1183
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,839
intelligence is

1184
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,040
at the heart of uh military cyber

1185
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,280
operations and i would argue that you

1186
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,560
know you can't have

1187
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
effective cyber operations without

1188
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,119
robust signals intelligence capabilities

1189
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,040
uh on one hand moving towards a unified

1190
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,760
command

1191
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,640
uh and those signals intelligence that

1192
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,520
the role of that that does help to

1193
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
give greater attention greater resources

1194
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,720
and

1195
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,880
the focus towards integrating those

1196
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,240
digital capabilities

1197
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,440
into more analog operations uh with

1198
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,599
other traditional kinetic domain

1199
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,800
operations

1200
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,599
it gives the ability to try and

1201
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,640
integrate those

1202
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
more effectively than siloing or

1203
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,119
isolating cyber capabilities

1204
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,160
in a subordinated structure but at the

1205
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,480
same time the natural key question of

1206
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,200
when you sort of elevate a command to a

1207
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,400
unified command

1208
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,359
and they do start taking on uh these

1209
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,440
signals intelligence roles traditionally

1210
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,200
played by

1211
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,760
civilian intelligence agencies how do

1212
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
you deconflict and or coordinate those

1213
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,720
operations

1214
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,440
uh civilian intelligence agencies again

1215
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,079
are

1216
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,839
most likely going to prioritize

1217
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,680
intelligence collection and

1218
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,400
network exploitation over potentially

1219
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
the preferences for disruption

1220
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
owned by the military so that's the next

1221
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,520
uh

1222
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,960
that's the next step the next question

1223
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
that needs to be asked is as these cyber

1224
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,480
forces

1225
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,880
are increasingly elevated and taking on

1226
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,160
a larger and larger scope of

1227
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,520
responsibility

1228
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,040
how do you deconflict that with the

1229
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
ongoing missions of civilian

1230
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,319
intelligence agencies

1231
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,960
uh we you know the dual hat arrangement

1232
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,720
between us cyber command and the

1233
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,400
national security agency

1234
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,280
is one way of trying to address that but

1235
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,119
it's not the only way and we see with

1236
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:11,520
the

1237
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
united kingdom's national cyber force

1238
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,040
that they constructed

1239
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,680
that's another approach so hopefully

1240
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,240
that

1241
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,760
addressed both of those questions yes

1242
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
thank you very much for that and i

1243
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,839
assume the united kingdom

1244
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,359
kingdom's force is joint

1245
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,200
and also

1246
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,079
unified right if i'm because it's

1247
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,440
composers of mod

1248
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,640
and signals unit

1249
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,640
under that i would i would push back on

1250
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,880
that a little bit in the sense that

1251
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,079
it contains a military component uh the

1252
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,760
the cyber component that reports to

1253
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,440
strategic command

1254
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,599
is a part of the nashville cyber force

1255
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,480
however

1256
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,319
the organization the national cyber

1257
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,520
force itself

1258
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,000
is composed of parallel civilian

1259
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,599
capabilities

1260
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,920
so this is i would say it does not fall

1261
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,200
within the typology

1262
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,480
that i offer it is a next step right the

1263
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,119
next step

1264
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,640
is how can we create and assess the ways

1265
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,599
in which

1266
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,720
uh states have institutionalized

1267
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,400
cooperation and deconfliction between

1268
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,240
civilian and military elements

1269
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,040
so i would say that the the joint

1270
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,400
military structure

1271
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,559
contributing to the national cyber force

1272
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,319
is part of the equation

1273
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,800
uh but the other part of the equation is

1274
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,240
with gchq

1275
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
and all the other civilian civilian

1276
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,440
elements

1277
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,559
uh it's an entirely new construct

1278
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,920
uh in the context of my paper

1279
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,720
thank you very much and uh before we uh

1280
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,400
turn to audience

1281
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,640
questions to martin there are a couple

1282
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,359
of questions from audience to you

1283
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,480
jason and one of them is

1284
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,760
the role about civilian contractors

1285
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,760
as many include

1286
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,680
military structures include those and

1287
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,440
i guess in your paper you included

1288
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,319
reservists and also non-state actors

1289
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,920
so should they um be

1290
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,320
part of the um

1291
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,680
[Music]

1292
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,359
active forces or um is there any

1293
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,760
characteristic in in

1294
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,640
the typology you you looked how do

1295
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,200
states

1296
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,839
approach that

1297
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,520
that's great that's a great question and

1298
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,880
i would respond in the sense that

1299
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,920
while civilian contractors or

1300
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,839
non-state actors that may be affiliated

1301
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,359
with governments or carrying out

1302
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,319
operations on behalf of governments

1303
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,240
i would argue that they do not

1304
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,760
constitute

1305
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
the primary military cyber force

1306
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,280
definitionally

1307
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,760
with what i'm advancing however one

1308
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,440
thing that you cannot capture

1309
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,960
in the quantitative work that i've done

1310
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,359
in this paper that would require

1311
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,319
qualitative

1312
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,480
assessment or case study is okay when we

1313
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,760
have

1314
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,040
a principal military cyber force within

1315
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
a country

1316
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,119
what are the relations or how are those

1317
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,240
connections uh being utilized to

1318
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,800
non-military actors right the same you

1319
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,559
could say the same thing with reservists

1320
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,200
right

1321
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,760
uh definitionally i would argue that

1322
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,160
reservists do not constitute

1323
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,640
the primary military cyber force but

1324
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
they can be part of

1325
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,160
the primary military cyber force uh so

1326
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,920
these are this is getting into some

1327
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,800
conceptual and definitional exclusions

1328
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,960
but they are important to include

1329
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,800
and this does require additional

1330
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,400
qualitative case work

1331
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,000
uh and there are some people that have

1332
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,440
done work on

1333
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,119
uh sort of the what you would call the

1334
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,760
outsourcing of military operations or

1335
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,280
cyber operations

1336
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,559
uh to these civilian elements uh in some

1337
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,440
cases

1338
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
for plausible deniability um so i would

1339
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,640
say they're they don't constitute cyber

1340
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,800
forces according to my definition

1341
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,640
uh but they are part of the equation

1342
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,240
that needs to show up qualitatively

1343
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,920
yes that's correct and also um

1344
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,839
to just remind what you said about the

1345
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,599
analytical challenges in

1346
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
in finding actually information about

1347
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,839
that and of course expert interviews are

1348
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,200
one way to do that

1349
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,400
and now i would like to turn to martin

1350
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,760
there have been couple of

1351
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,520
questions which i perhaps can summarize

1352
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,119
so one of them is regarding them

1353
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,319
how concerned you are about the ability

1354
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,200
of

1355
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,760
quantum computers in breaking the

1356
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,800
current

1357
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,920
cryptology and i know that in your paper

1358
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,280
it was discussed alternative quantum

1359
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,839
resistant

1360
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,200
symmetric cryptology measures so

1361
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,680
could you say something about that and

1362
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,880
in addition

1363
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,319
um also what is the effect to the

1364
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,640
state strategic power balance of ability

1365
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,160
to on the one hand

1366
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,520
to have a quantum key distribution

1367
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,880
and safeguard security of the

1368
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,559
communications

1369
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,760
and how does this affect the ability to

1370
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,319
actually

1371
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,240
attribute cyber attacks and finally it's

1372
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,079
a question about

1373
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,559
standards and there is some work being

1374
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,000
done in international

1375
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,200
standardization organizations but do you

1376
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,839
think

1377
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,119
or do you are you afraid that

1378
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,640
china would set the standards as

1379
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,040
they are doing perhaps in the area of 5g

1380
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,000
so thank you

1381
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,920
over to you okay well thanks those are

1382
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
three really meaty questions so let me

1383
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,359
answer them in order

1384
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,680
uh first thing is how concerned am i

1385
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,520
over

1386
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,200
being able to crack asymmetric

1387
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,359
encryptions the folks who

1388
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,119
in the encryption business have at least

1389
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,599
a 25-year head start over the folks in

1390
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,040
the quantum business

1391
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,720
because it's been taking very long to

1392
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,079
get quantum

1393
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,559
computers that have enough qubits

1394
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,440
together

1395
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,800
to do any useful work in fact i don't

1396
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,359
we're starting to see some applications

1397
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,000
of what's called

1398
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,520
quantum supremacy um but they're very

1399
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,680
specialized and they don't necessarily

1400
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,240
apply to

1401
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,280
apply to encryption so

1402
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,599
when you add the 25-year head start the

1403
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,319
fact that they have a lot of choices

1404
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,200
you have at least in the united states a

1405
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,839
belief

1406
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,040
that software methods will stay ahead of

1407
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,160
quantum

1408
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,880
computers for a long time to come the

1409
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,440
problem

1410
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,160
in encryption is the problem you have in

1411
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,720
any

1412
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,760
highly classified intelligence measure

1413
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,440
countermeasure contest

1414
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
is that you don't know what the other

1415
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,359
side is doing you can make a guess right

1416
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,880
the other side is not violating the laws

1417
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,599
of physics

1418
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,040
probably but exactly how far they've

1419
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
gotten along in the mathematics

1420
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,079
is only going to be a guess and

1421
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,760
as people in the court in the encryption

1422
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,640
business uh will understand

1423
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,680
you have to make some very

1424
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,480
serious worst case assumptions about

1425
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,839
what the other side can do

1426
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,400
in order to feel at all secure about

1427
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
what you are doing and even then you're

1428
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,559
not going to feel all that secure okay

1429
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,240
second question you asked was about

1430
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,839
state power

1431
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,680
there is a great deal of concern that

1432
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,839
china has made a lot of progress in the

1433
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,160
area of quantum communications

1434
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,839
that believe they have a dedicated

1435
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,640
satellite

1436
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,040
they have some serious long-range fiber

1437
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,240
optics work

1438
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,760
we have to take that seriously

1439
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,440
but that doesn't necessarily mean

1440
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,040
that from a strategic and policy point

1441
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,760
of view we have to copy what they do

1442
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,720
okay you can never afford to ignore the

1443
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,880
technological paths that other countries

1444
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,839
go

1445
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,240
down but that doesn't necessarily prove

1446
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,559
that you should go down the same path

1447
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,319
okay i mean darpa used to say the only

1448
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,920
way to predict the future is to invent

1449
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,520
it

1450
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,960
it's not a bad guide for

1451
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,440
for how you do policy for how you do

1452
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,200
technological development

1453
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,760
so we can't ignore it but that doesn't

1454
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,520
necessarily mean that we have to be in a

1455
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,079
race

1456
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,960
with these guys for quantum

1457
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,880
communications okay it depends on our

1458
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,280
needs

1459
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,760
not their needs and in any case

1460
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,359
particular technology generally speaking

1461
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,359
is down the stack of all the factors

1462
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,640
that determine

1463
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,640
uh national power and comparative

1464
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,920
national power

1465
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,319
okay the third thing you talked about is

1466
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,200
standards

1467
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
we have seen as you have indicated a

1468
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
very aggressive

1469
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,440
uh stance taken by china in the

1470
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,400
development

1471
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,799
of i.t standards all across the board

1472
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,000
um this this

1473
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,720
is a kind of a complicated question if

1474
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,079
you were to take a look at standards

1475
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,480
development in the 70s 80s and 90s as i

1476
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,359
have done

1477
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,920
earlier in my career you find out that

1478
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,880
on paper

1479
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
it looks like from the u.s perspective

1480
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,720
that the other people are ahead

1481
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,040
because they're much more fully involved

1482
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,640
in the standards process it used to be a

1483
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,079
complaint from the united states the

1484
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,040
standards

1485
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,839
processes were dominated by europeans

1486
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,319
because every country got one vote

1487
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,520
and the european telephone and telegraph

1488
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,400
companies

1489
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
basically could outvote the united

1490
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,480
states okay well it turns out that's not

1491
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,240
where internet standards came from

1492
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,640
they came from a voluntary effort

1493
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,920
developed

1494
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,079
by people who had experience in the

1495
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,920
technology

1496
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,160
these days most of our de facto

1497
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
standards come from the usage

1498
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,559
of those folks who have dominant market

1499
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,760
positions

1500
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,480
and i don't expect that to change when

1501
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
it comes to quantum communications

1502
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,599
however

1503
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,319
the it's not entirely clear at this

1504
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:16,960
stage

1505
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
and the key words here are at this stage

1506
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
that you really need a lot of standards

1507
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,880
to make the technology work

1508
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,960
first you have to fundamentally make the

1509
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,160
technology work

1510
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,359
okay and that's going to be a

1511
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,520
development within individual countries

1512
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,599
within individual military alliances

1513
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,200
such as nato

1514
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,759
so on and so forth okay and since

1515
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,240
you're spending most of your time in

1516
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,160
quantum communications talking to

1517
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,280
yourself

1518
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,200
in other words for parts of the military

1519
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,319
the intelligence community

1520
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,839
to talk to other parts of the military

1521
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,160
intelligence community global standards

1522
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,839
are not all that important

1523
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,960
okay the demand for us to talk in a

1524
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,319
highly secure method to the chinese

1525
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,400
is probably less important than our

1526
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
ability to keep the chinese from

1527
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,839
understanding what we're doing

1528
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,640
when we talk to others using highly

1529
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,319
classified methods

1530
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,640
okay so you never want to ignore

1531
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,920
standards but it's not going to be a

1532
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,359
central driver here

1533
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,480
at least not at this point thank you

1534
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,119
very much

1535
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,440
and now when we have less than two

1536
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,240
minutes

1537
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
left first of all i would like to thank

1538
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,760
you very much for the

1539
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,599
very interesting discussion but the

1540
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,960
final question

1541
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,240
uh from me that has been bugging me and

1542
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,040
coming back to the broader discussion

1543
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,720
about emerging

1544
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,359
and disruptive technologies and also

1545
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,880
jason i would

1546
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,240
welcome your opinion what should we do

1547
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,040
to counterbalance chinese influence

1548
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,960
especially in those areas

1549
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,680
of technologies relevant to cyberspace

1550
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,000
as

1551
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,599
ai data analytics and and quantum

1552
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,359
and how do we achieve this

1553
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,200
truly transatlantic cooperation and

1554
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,599
we we discussed with martin before how

1555
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,640
much uh

1556
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,200
eu has invested into this and has

1557
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,480
achieved really

1558
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,000
impressive um achievements so to speak

1559
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,280
uh uh one milli billion errors

1560
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,319
during the next 10 years

1561
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,240
also already working

1562
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,400
quantum internet and quantum

1563
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,000
communications

1564
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,520
prototype or or rudimentary versions

1565
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,119
so what is your quick takeaway for the

1566
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,000
policymakers in nato so maybe we start

1567
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,880
from json

1568
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,960
thank you so just very quickly

1569
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,480
because i would have a lot to say on

1570
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,240
this but unfortunately we're running out

1571
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,040
of time

1572
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,160
uh two quick points one the further

1573
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,440
development of technical

1574
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,160
and training standards uh among nato and

1575
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,599
the eu

1576
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,960
that is low-hanging fruit and second

1577
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,240
i would say is uh work to develop the

1578
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,640
human capability and human capacity

1579
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,079
within militaries

1580
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,119
uh consultations among allies allies

1581
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,960
within nato are not likely to share

1582
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,440
cyber weapons due to their nature

1583
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,680
but they are like more much more likely

1584
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,880
to uh

1585
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,960
work on developing partnered and allied

1586
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,160
skills

1587
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,760
so the transference of skills not

1588
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,680
necessarily technology

1589
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,839
looks like a fruitful avenue for the

1590
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,480
future

1591
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,280
martin oh yeah let me chime in i i

1592
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,200
spent part of my misspent career hanging

1593
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,839
out with darpa and folks at inquitel

1594
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,599
and without revealing any state secrets

1595
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,440
let's say the technology transfer is

1596
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,079
very very

1597
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,240
difficult when you have an r d community

1598
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,440
on the one hand

1599
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,960
and the user community say in the

1600
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,640
military or the intelligence community

1601
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,240
on the other hand

1602
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,880
and most of what you develop even though

1603
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,119
it meets the needs of technologists

1604
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,359
has a difficult time transitioning to

1605
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,559
the field

1606
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,520
okay and this is an area where the same

1607
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,839
institution owns a technologist

1608
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,160
and owns the military folks when you

1609
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,200
talk about

1610
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,559
nato technology you have one further

1611
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,520
remove

1612
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,000
okay you have one more barrier to get

1613
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,599
from one to the other

1614
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,559
so i've although i think that nato r d

1615
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,559
is better than no r d

1616
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,839
for the purposes of taking up

1617
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:28,000
technology um it's a little bit harder

1618
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,880
it's a little bit harder thank you very

1619
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,599
much

1620
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,160
martin and jason and this was excellent

1621
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:34,960
discussion

1622
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,520
thank you everyone for joining us and

1623
