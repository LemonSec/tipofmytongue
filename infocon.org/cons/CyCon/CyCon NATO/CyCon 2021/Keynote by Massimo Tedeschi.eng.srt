5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,799
chief technology officer at leonardo who

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,560
will share his insights on operational

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,199
systems

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
cyber resilience at the core of

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,720
supernatural

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
sorry supranational defense please mr

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,840
tedeschi the floor is yours

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,000
[Music]

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
thank you thank you very much for

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
hosting for me part of this very

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
international and interesting answer uh

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
we as a leonardo group also we have very

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,239
care about uh the problem about uh the

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
sovereignty of the of the

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,280
of the cyber uh world and uh we as a

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
global player in this

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
in this world are very interested about

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
trying to protect

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
all the the the activity and the

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,680
problems that we

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,799
put on the market in uh our group as

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,840
you probably know is uh oriented on

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,320
different

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
approach and different areas like

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
helicopters so because we are playing

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
aerospace defense and security

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
organization when

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
where we try to make an integrated offer

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:20,960
on

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,600
on this field so we we build a

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
helicopter we

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
make an electronic division we have an

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
electronic division that try to support

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
also the the

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
military world the cyber series itself

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,439
and the other

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
other companies controlled by other in

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
in the world like leonardo diaz

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
electronic mba but also uh

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
aeronautics so the aircraft division

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
arrow structures and

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
at least also the activity in the space

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
that is a new frontier

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,439
of the technology but also the cyber

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,759
security with del espacio dallas

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,479
space and this very interesting uh how

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,600
we can

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
try to define the role of our division

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
itself with the leonardo cyber division

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,479
because

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
we think that uh the the security is

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,880
something that you have to to to

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,439
analyze in different parts especially

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,318
for the products

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
that we try to put on the market we can

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,520
try to

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
make products services um

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
applications and platforms that

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
can support the government to the

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
institutions also the enterprise to

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
make sure that uh the securities is

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
first

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
yes for us the uh we try to be

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
the partner of choice of the country the

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,840
italian and youth for european and the

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
world

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
try to secure the digital ecosystem our

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,519
life

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
is now in the in the in the digital

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
although our life

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
is uh embedded with the cell phone

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
devices that make part of our life our

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,480
uh remembers are inside this device so

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
we have to

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
uh to protect this kind of assets but

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,720
also we have to

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
to guarantee the resiliency the the

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,879
capability to

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
continue delivering the intended

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,239
outcomes

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
despite the adverse cyber attacks so we

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
try to uh secure data secure

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
national transformation of digital

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,920
assets

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
uh we are a mission partner of the nato

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
in cyber defense

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,239
we try to protect the critical

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,519
infrastructure nationally and

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,640
internationally

94
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
and also we try to protect the transfer

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,799
of communication

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
transfer data with also professional

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
communication infrastructure

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,480
uh in in very very much countries

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
and but uh because we are oriented on

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
a civil market we try to protect the

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:40,879
citizen

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
and the cities and the the the the area

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
where the seasons leaves

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
and so we try to make more efficient and

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
more protected the rain

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
and road transportation try also to

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,200
introduce

108
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
some cyber approach cyber production and

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,879
resilience

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
approach and try also to make this kind

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,239
of

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
a security first approach also in events

113
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,280
like

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
cortina 2021 uh for the mission that

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
i've just tried to describe

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
uh about the the central approach of

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,439
data

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,480
we try to make a shield on this uh

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
information on the data that are part of

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,320
our our life

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,199
our institution and our company we try

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,400
to take the data

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,680
gathering from information from

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
different uh clients to try to protect

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,120
them to make

126
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
the digitalization try to make

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
efficiency

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,960
the process of making use of the data

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,600
that they are

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,320
in the digital process trying to make

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,880
additional values

132
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
try to communicate this kind of data and

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
the process and voice for a

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,000
policy enforcement infrastructure for

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,639
enterprises make secure communication

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
protect the communication

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
and also through the comfort rooms

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
we try to make the information usable

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,919
uh to people that needs to use when

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
and where you have to to use and to

141
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
exploit this kind of information try to

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
make services really first and security

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
by design

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
in its approach and also the cyber

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,720
resilience is very important for us

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
how we can say that this kind of

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
approach about security and data

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,720
have impacted the oit and ot convergence

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
because something is changed in the

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
scenario that we

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
try to lead because uh the technology

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
represents a very interesting

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,479
critical business challenge for the

154
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
organization that

155
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
have to to to be competitive and gain

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
advantage

157
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,639
uh prices forming also the operational

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,520
environments

159
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
so you have to have your infrastructure

160
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
your production infrastructure

161
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,039
efficiency the reliability and the

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
agility and you have also to

163
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
put together the the physical converge

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
of the security of managing

165
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
the the sensors to the uh the the the

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,039
cameras or whatever can protect your

167
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,680
asset

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
also with a very very deep introduction

169
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
of software and other convergence

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
and try to define a new approach of

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
managing the process

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
try to define also new business model

173
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,479
can be useful for

174
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
more flexibility uh adaptability of the

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
of the company itself and the product

176
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,960
software to the needs of the markets

177
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
um from this point of view we can say

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,160
that uh

179
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
uh the ot uh devices and approach

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
is changed uh in the in the during the

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,919
time

182
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
because in the 1990s uh the ot system

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,160
are always isolated from the internet

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
and

185
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
closed network that you cannot uh

186
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
connect to the to the internet and to

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
other assets

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
and during the time this kind of

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
approach

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,039
has a little bit changed the it and the

191
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,240
ot system

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
are increasingly trying to integrate

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,319
each other because you have to

194
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
make more effective the production

195
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,240
process make a

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
usable make control of this kind of

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,840
devices

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
try to make not only electronics devices

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
but also i.t device that can control

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
itself

201
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
and now the paradigm of the industry 4.0

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
that try to make

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,400
the the industry process more effective

204
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,199
and more

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,039
flexible needs to to be more competitive

206
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,520
try to integrate with the convergence of

207
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,160
i.t

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,199
and other world and this kind of

209
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,680
approach

210
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
making convergence of the two worlds uh

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
can make

212
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
your more uh uh attractive and advanced

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
but from this point of view we also have

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,919
to uh

215
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
approach a different uh needs of the the

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
two worlds because

217
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,759
we have the the same

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
components of the user prospective roles

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
applications

220
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
workflow uh machines and the same

221
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,400
technologies for example pc

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,360
computers networks identity management

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
for the people that access this systems

224
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
software but it's a different priority

225
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
of the company itself in the it world we

226
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
have to

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,319
protect the confidentiality of the

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,199
information

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
first the integrity information and

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
their availability

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,919
in the audi world the priority is more

232
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
oriented on availability

233
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,479
uh avoiding denial of service adrenal

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,878
server

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
infrastructure itself the integrity of

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,639
the infrastructure itself

237
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
and at the end also the confidentiality

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,279
because also the information managed by

239
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,440
this kind of autism are very interesting

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
very useful for

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,559
the company itself and the organization

242
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
itself so there is a little bit

243
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
different about sensors about the pc

244
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,480
but you have to to have a quite similar

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,279
approach

246
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,480
for the ot and the i.t world that's also

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,200
changed

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
the uh approach for managing the threats

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,480
that

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
are oriented on the ot environment uh

251
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,279
we can say that uh we have a change

252
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,680
from a bespoke malware to a commodity

253
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,399
malware

254
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
that can also

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,080
gain it by reducing the cost of the

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
malware and

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,640
the the criminal activity we can

258
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,279
remember

259
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,640
2010 the first tax net

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
attack that is more oriented on

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
um ot devices with usb uh stick that

262
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,279
try to uh block the files and uh using

263
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
four or zero days

264
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,160
uh explanation try to block the producer

265
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
some company the production and

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,560
some foreign countries but this kind of

267
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,839
approach

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
is changed during the the time because

269
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
we can see that it's a more oriented

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
approach to the i t device attack

271
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
that can block or try to

272
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
uh make increases on on

273
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
infrastructure right infrastructure with

274
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
run so where so it's not

275
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
very tailor and approach and attack

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
oriented on this kind of solution

277
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
for example the havocs it's a wettering

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
in 2013 it's a watering hole that

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,360
in fact a website where people can

280
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
acquire information in fact

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
the the pc itself and

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
make a literal movement to try to block

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
also the ot

284
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
environment for example the last one

285
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
the 2020 2021 the 18th uh

286
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
try to uh with also i can say standard

287
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
approach

288
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,599
trying to

289
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,279
block the services of antivirus of the

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,160
it system

291
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
and ot system try to to kill the process

292
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
of industrial

293
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
control system and also with attacking

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,680
the

295
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
rdp the real desktop protocol to have

296
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
gained the access to the

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
audi um infrastructure and to try to

298
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,120
block it

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
and the last one this year unfortunately

300
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,320
that

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
we we can follow the the the news on the

302
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,360
uh

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
on the web about uh dark side that

304
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
try to to control and to to attack the

305
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
colonial pipeline in the u.s

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
it's um an attack on may 17 to

307
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
may 12 that try to gather the

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
information because uh

309
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,880
approximately 100 gigabytes of data as

310
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
leakage by the infrastructure but also

311
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
this kind of approach

312
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
is based on ram so our approach so the

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
idea is more

314
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
gained by economic interest more than

315
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
destroy the interests so also the the uh

316
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
the villians tries also to excuse about

317
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,760
the approach and the attack

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
on this kind of infrastructure so the

319
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,200
approach is

320
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
very very important also for one

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,880
important asset like

322
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
the defense because we can see that also

323
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
the defense

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
is a very important target from for

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,839
example uh

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
guaranteed supernational uh security

327
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
and tried also to um to increment

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
the capability of managing all the

329
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,480
supply chain

330
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
of this kind of actors because we can

331
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,519
see cyber attacks

332
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
on military targets try to also attack

333
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,040
sensors platform

334
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
you know that the the new world will be

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
the five-dimensional world on the cyber

336
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
world more than a cyanic attack that can

337
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,440
be

338
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
more effective than the india than in

339
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
the past

340
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,959
there are also some attacks on on the

341
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,920
civil target

342
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
trying to also publish publish

343
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,519
confidential information

344
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
fake news or acquiring uh

345
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
espionage activity trying to uh to to

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
to gain the intellectual property of

347
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,680
companies organization

348
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
and at the end also try to block the

349
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
military operation itself

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
also for irregular groups and regular

351
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
forces

352
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,000
and this kind of uh attack this kind of

353
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
approach

354
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
should be very important in defense

355
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
especially on

356
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
energy infrastructure because the effort

357
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,600
should be

358
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
interrupting the energy supply of

359
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,639
defense and so

360
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
you have also to uh capability of

361
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
blocking the activity

362
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
and the operations of the this kind of

363
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,560
world

364
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
but also disrupting civilian the the

365
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
the the attack of 2001 the colonial

366
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,519
pipeline

367
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,839
uh is very important interesting because

368
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,959
uh it blocked

369
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
the the the pipeline of of gas

370
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,600
in the u.s so the people have fear about

371
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
the undermined social question on this

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,639
kind of attack that

373
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
they feel very very uh very very hard

374
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,399
and also

375
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,760
it's something like uh uh trying to

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
intimidate also the other the opposite

377
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
like uh

378
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
the the cold war approach

379
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,519
uh understanding that you i can come i

380
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,560
can

381
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,600
attack you and i can put you down

382
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
with your infrastructure especially from

383
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
energy energetic point of view

384
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,000
so we have tried to make some solutions

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
and support for approaching the

386
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
cyber resilience of energy transport

387
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,560
energy world

388
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,600
infrastructure for the defense first

389
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,399
try to define uh cyber resilience

390
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
strategy and threat modeling the

391
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
one of the most important things is

392
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,079
trying to uh to build

393
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
a model that can understand the the the

394
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,760
attack

395
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
model from the target to infrastructure

396
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,240
to the uh act of director and the

397
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
on the on the system that can use

398
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,519
the malware then use on the on the

399
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
infrastructure itself

400
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,680
in the design trying to define a

401
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,399
solution

402
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
uh secured by design secure the

403
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
configuration because

404
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
managing the infrastructure itself can

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
may put some problems

406
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,720
on the field and make it i can say

407
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
on hypervision awareness a wall

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
holistic approach of the cyber

409
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
protection and situational awareness not

410
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,760
only on the

411
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
on the physical world but also on the

412
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
cyber world

413
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,160
this kind of approach have to support us

414
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,079
to try to introduce one of the

415
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,880
most important

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
organization in our country italian

417
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,199
minister of defense

418
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
try to develop an energy security and

419
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
sustainability solution

420
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,639
because you can imagine that our mod has

421
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
3 000 sites and also it's a very very

422
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,959
um consumer of

423
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,720
energy with also 600 gigabytes

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,199
of uh hours so how we can try to support

425
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
this kind of approach first

426
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,880
try to make a analysis analysis of the

427
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,959
energetic infrastructure of the customer

428
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
itself also try to identify

429
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
the components the cyber components that

430
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,560
can be useful for exploiting

431
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
an attack and trying to protect this

432
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
kind of infrastructure second

433
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
try to also to make a resiliency and

434
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,759
afford resilience infrastructure

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,959
trying to define the kpi for using the

436
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,360
the the same sustainability the same

437
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
kind of infrastructure

438
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
and define the also the energetic

439
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
efficiency

440
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
of the of the area or the defense area

441
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
from this point of view trying also to

442
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,240
define

443
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
uh and exploit all

444
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
the support for make the vulnerability

445
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
of cyber

446
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
attacks for ot components of the energy

447
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
pipeline the energy process made more

448
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,720
efficient and more

449
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
uh active the same kind of approach we

450
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
also try to put also

451
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
in the fob in the forward

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,199
basis where we have to put our troops

453
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
our infrastructure abroad and we have to

454
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,800
support them from

455
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
also energy point of view and this kind

456
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,000
of approach

457
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
can be should be protected for example

458
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
trying to make

459
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
some kind of a transformation

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
of the voltage on the frequency of the

461
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
company itself and try to

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,199
put together micro grid on nano grid

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,119
to support this kind of process the same

464
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
thing on

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
gas distribution networks and for

466
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
example for a cyber awareness

467
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,599
project also in the um you have defense

468
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,079
a

469
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,559
defense project this kind of approach

470
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,439
cannot pass

471
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
to to to try to make a

472
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
planning that where you can have as an

473
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,640
objective the

474
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
energy efficiency the cyber risk

475
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
reduction

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
demand side the management also for

477
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
different provider

478
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,240
of energy monitoring and evaluation the

479
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
cyber threats anomaly detection

480
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
that can change in the scenario during

481
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
the time and also

482
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
trying to monitor and control the

483
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
different scenarios that can be

484
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,240
very dynamic but this kind of approach

485
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
can also support the disciple operation

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
that leonardo purchase

487
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
to using with also italian common and

488
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
control and cyber operation

489
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,120
try to make uh the intelligence approach

490
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,919
understanding

491
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,640
the threats uh try to also simulating

492
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
and making a digital twin

493
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
of this kind of attack with also our

494
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
cyber ranger that can simulate

495
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,880
artists or discard the network

496
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,919
that can be used for not only um testing

497
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,000
the your infrastructure but also before

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
supporting the

499
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
people in in training so i have a

500
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
governance automation cyber security

501
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,559
awareness

502
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,600
fusion decision room like uh dss support

503
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:31,840
and

504
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,799
and uh and training and uh this kind of

505
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,120
uh

506
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,360
approach also can uh visit on the

507
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
intelligent cycle uh

508
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,640
collects information from intelligence

509
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
there are

510
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
sources connect them analyze it also in

511
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
the

512
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,559
artificial intelligence approach uh

513
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,200
interacts

514
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
this kind of uh of system also the

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,559
operators

516
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
and disseminate the result of this

517
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,320
activity

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
um the approach is that

519
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,320
by building uh the architecture building

520
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
secure by design

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
defining infrastructure requirement uh

522
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,840
making the

523
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
architectural self and contracting data

524
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
cloud-based model for emergency with

525
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
service that can

526
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
integrate the cyber threat intelligence

527
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
both in device management dot device

528
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
management and the risk monitoring

529
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
but also trying to handle the incident

530
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
uh

531
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
activity and uh uh the other approach is

532
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,679
trying to define a dynamic

533
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
rule uh risk assessment and the

534
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
compliance with the the

535
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,360
the the rules and uh try to adapt also

536
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
the organizational model definition

537
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
uh with all the services that can

538
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,679
support forensic analysis iot security

539
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,200
um management uh and accept that to

540
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
monitor this kind of approach

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
but as you can imagine all these

542
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
approach

543
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,799
the two different uh moments the

544
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
tactical phase that

545
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
have for example from some national

546
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,679
critical infrastructure

547
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,320
to make immediate recommendation but

548
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,799
also

549
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
with forensic analysis try to define a

550
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
new level of exposure

551
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
of in reduction but also trying to make

552
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,720
a strategy phase

553
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
trying to build the new model of

554
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,159
managing the security

555
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,880
especially in out the world but a part

556
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,120
of the technologies as you can imagine

557
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,840
also in the ot worlds what you need in

558
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
conclusion is the

559
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,919
uh does always the very very uh

560
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,799
important

561
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
chain uh that is the people the the

562
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
trainees and the world

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
of the people because as you can imagine

564
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,600
sometimes is always a click on some

565
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
operators that can start

566
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
the activity of attacking so also the

567
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
trainer also the awareness of this

568
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,559
approach

569
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,039
could be really an effective try to

570
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
reduce the risk of this kind of attack

571
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:02,880
also for energy infrastructure thank you

572
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,559
thank you mr tedescu uh this indeed were

573
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,919
valuable insights

574
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
uh but we have still time for at least

575
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,679
one question

576
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,360
so let's take it from the audience i

577
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
think we have one from the audience

578
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,919
saying to which degree should

579
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,039
governments prescribe

580
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,039
the security measures for critical

581
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,520
infrastructures

582
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
i suppose that we are rising

583
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,520
the awareness of the government from the

584
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
infrastructure

585
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,640
not only in the incident and in

586
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
remediation but also try to define some

587
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
rules that

588
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
all the critical infrastructure should

589
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
have for protecting this kind of

590
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
approach especially because uh

591
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
the backbone of our infrastructure often

592
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,039
is based on very very old

593
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,960
operative systems that are normally

594
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,240
actioned so

595
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,720
defining some rules like in the national

596
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
perimeter security that

597
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,880
italian government has promoted to

598
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,919
increase

599
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
the capability and the rules of the

600
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
government perhaps also

601
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,480
um in the international to define the

602
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
minimum level of security that all

603
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
infrastructure

604
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
have to comply with okay uh

605
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,120
thank you unfortunately we don't have

606
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,280
more time for uh for another question

607
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,480
even though there were some

608
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
but uh thank you once again mr todesky

609
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,559
for this discussion

610
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
of course protecting critical

611
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,159
infrastructure and operation systems

612
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
is definitely a must for both national

613
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,080
and supranational defense so

614
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
thank you once again thank you also for

615
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,679
meeting you bye-bye

616
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,760
thank you mr turkey and now to prepare

617
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
for the next session and allow us to

618
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
stretch our legs we shall have a short

619
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
break

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,159
and after the break we will

621
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,400
follow the model of having three

622
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,919
parallel sessions

623
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,720
on stage one the session will be on the

624
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,159
great power competition

625
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
in the new decade moderated by pirate

626
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,840
bernick

627
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
researcher at the strategy branch of the

628
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,760
ccd coe

629
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
and on stage two there will be a panel

630
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
discussion on the standards of

631
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,000
attribution

632
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,480
and due diligence in cyberspace

633
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
moderated by a friend and former

634
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
colleague at the csdce

635
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,320
thomas minorik and finally on stage 3

636
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
we will have a panel titled cyber space

637
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,159
cubed moderated by deputy directors

638
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,280
cyber defense

639
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,799
in the uk cabinet office beat cooper

640
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
first of all enjoy the break and see you

641
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:36,220
again at the top of the hour thank you

642
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,400
