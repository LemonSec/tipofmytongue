2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
good afternoon and a very warm welcome

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,000
to our afternoon panel session on

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,239
defending the cyber front with ai

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,640
my name is bruce watson and i have the

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
pleasure in honor of hosting the session

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,359
this afternoon

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,359
i happen to be a researcher and also a

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
practitioner in both cyber security

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
and artificial intelligence and it's my

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,519
pleasure to bring to you

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,039
a couple of very interesting speakers

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,200
this afternoon of course we'd like to

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,239
start off just by thanking ccdcoe

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,559
for their organization of such a top

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,600
shelf conference

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,960
it's really outstanding work um so it's

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
a real pleasure as i said and an honor

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,239
to have you with us today

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,840
um we know that you had a couple of

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,280
choices of different sessions that you

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
could have attended

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
and it's very nice that you've chosen to

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
join us for this one in particular

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,280
um in particular if i look at the the

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
topic area of artificial intelligence

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
combined with cyber security

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,319
it's a very exciting and highly relevant

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,760
part of the current cyber security

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
threat landscape and there are two

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
sub-topics in particular that we'll be

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,960
talking about today that

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
really mesh with i think the most

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
advanced topics that occur

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
within both of these fields the first of

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,439
them is

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,240
explainable ai so typical artificial

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,600
intelligence systems involve

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
constructing a system

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
often built from a lot of data these are

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
so-called training data

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
that are then used to build an

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
artificial intelligence model

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
most typically this is using machine

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,759
learning algorithms

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
and as a result we have an artificially

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
intelligent system which may be very

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,680
narrow

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,520
very narrowly focused to the particular

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
domain but is able to solve particular

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
problems within that domain

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,119
but it doesn't shed any light on the

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
internal structure of that domain

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
so in other words the solution is a

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
black box solution and we don't really

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
have any deeper understanding of

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
the structure of the cyber security

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
threats so it eventually becomes

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
important to be able to gain that deeper

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
understanding and to really be able to

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
understand

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
why the system is making certain

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
decisions that it does

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,439
and this would lead us to wanting a kind

65
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
of system that's a so-called glass box

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,399
system

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
or an openly explainable ai system now

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
it turns out that such systems are

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
exactly the holy grail of the artificial

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
intelligence research

71
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
so as desirable as they are it's an

72
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
extremely difficult technical problem to

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
solve and a vast number of researchers

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
are working on this worldwide

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
so we'll have the pleasure of talking a

76
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,080
little bit about one of those in a

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,879
particular

78
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,519
subdomain today which is very important

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,879
progress

80
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
the other one of course is as mentioned

81
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
autonomous system so

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
along with explainable ai we would also

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
like to be able to have autonomous

84
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
artificially intelligent systems and i'm

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
not talking here about

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
offensive uh systems but autonomous

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
defensive systems that can take care of

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
certain aspects of cyber security all on

89
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
their own without human intervention

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
and this is then something that of

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
course provokes a large amount of

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
international debate it has an ethics

93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,239
component to it as well which is

94
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,400
uh is something that makes the news very

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,519
very quickly

96
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,120
and so it's a pleasure today to also

97
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
hear from one of the speakers

98
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,840
about recent work in uh towards autonomy

99
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
of such cyber defensive system

100
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,800
so that um coupled with explainable ai

101
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,519
will be the

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
two axes of the research that we

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
discussed today

104
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,879
so let me get to the two uh speakers

105
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
these are two speakers that you probably

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,599
will recognize from

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,280
from previous years the first one is

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
arthur's lathrunov

109
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,840
and the second one is roland mayer and

110
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
you can of course read about their

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
biographies within the uh the

112
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,519
proceedings

113
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,560
and on the website of cycon 2021 but in

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,040
a nutshell arters is a researcher at

115
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,879
nato's ccdcoe

116
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
he's got a strong interest in web and

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
network technologies

118
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,879
he's been working on of course cyber

119
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,920
exercises

120
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
locked shields in particular and he

121
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
spent some time also teaching at the

122
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
university of latvia which happens to be

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
where he is

124
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
currently a phd candidate working on his

125
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
dissertation

126
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
our second speaker today i also have the

127
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
pleasure of introducing is then roland

128
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
mayer and we'll be getting to him as our

129
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,080
second speaker

130
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,239
roland is also involved as a phd

131
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
candidate in this particular case in

132
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,519
electronic engineering

133
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
and information technology at eth in

134
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,279
surrey

135
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
and his interests are in security of

136
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,120
computer networks of course like many of

137
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,918
us as well

138
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,520
but he has a particular interest in

139
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
being able to use and leverage recent

140
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
advances

141
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
in software-defined networking and

142
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
programmability of networking

143
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
and he happens to have have obtained his

144
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
master's degree

145
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
at eth tsurig in the same department as

146
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,919
well so he's

147
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,199
very much at home in this kind of

148
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
research so

149
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
let me get to the format of today's talk

150
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
because i think you're not here to

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
necessarily hear me talk but

152
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
rather hear the the two viewpoints um of

153
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,280
our speakers

154
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
and we'll be able to return to a

155
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
discussion afterwards as well

156
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
so we're going to be starting off with

157
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
arthur in just a moment before going on

158
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,479
to

159
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
roland and i would very much like you to

160
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
already as we proceed to think about

161
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
particular questions you may have

162
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
it allows the questions if you pose them

163
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,759
soon enough to filter through to us and

164
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
to order the questions

165
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
so that we either discuss some of them

166
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
in between the two talks

167
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
or so that we could return to them in

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,919
the larger discussion at the end

169
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
now in the event of course that you're

170
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
watching this after the fact in the

171
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
archived version

172
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
of this session please feel free to

173
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,520
email us

174
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,639
we're very happy to engage on this topic

175
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
after the fact as well so without me

176
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,639
taking up more of our time

177
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
let me please turn it over to artur he's

178
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
going to be discussing explainable ai

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
in a particular problem subdomain thank

180
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
you please begin arthur

181
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
thank you for introduction and today we

182
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,479
are going to

183
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
to discuss one very let's say

184
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
specific topic and the specific topic is

185
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
classifying devices on the internet and

186
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
we will go into detail why it's

187
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
important later on but

188
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
uh currently we are trying to combine

189
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
expert knowledge and let's say research

190
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,120
knowledge and

191
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
my co-author is dr roman graf he has

192
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
been

193
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,759
in saigon for for many years

194
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
and when we started few years ago this

195
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,120
research he was

196
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
a full-time ai researcher in

197
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
austrian institute of technology and now

198
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
he is transferring his knowledge to

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,440
to private sector into accenture

200
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
so what's what is the problem

201
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,919
so the problem we have a lot of device

202
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,960
on the internet in reality there are

203
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,840
billions upon billions and

204
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,800
predictions say that in a

205
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
few years we would talk about 10 billion

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
or 20 billion of devices

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,280
so what kind of devices are these

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
so we are particularly interested in two

209
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
reachable devices what does reachable

210
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
means

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
means it's listening on one or more

212
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
ports

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
and this traffic is directly routed to

214
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
this device instead of being dropped

215
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,479
somewhere

216
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
so anyone can send

217
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
a packet on particular port to this

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
device and this device will process it

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,840
if anyone can send something anyone

220
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,080
can send malicious payload

221
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,919
uh maybe this device is vulnerable

222
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
maybe not if it's not vulnerable it

223
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
might become vulnerable in three years

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
when it's still connected in same way so

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,879
this is

226
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,000
kind of a huge problem and there are few

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
causes for it

228
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,440
first and foremost manufacturers

229
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
we see even today manufacturers

230
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,879
selling devices selling cheap devices

231
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,080
for

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,360
10 20 30 euros that does

233
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
some function in your home

234
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
some iot devices and

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
they have insecure default configuration

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,599
and some

237
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
some states are trying to battle it with

238
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
some regulation

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,319
but we are far from solution an insecure

240
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
default configuration would mean

241
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
uh the stuff that should

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
be listening only internally is

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
listening to the internet so this is

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,559
the easiest way uh we have seen

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
through our research a lot of vendors a

246
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,000
lot of

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
solution vendors that buy devices in

248
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,760
bulk

249
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
and develop solutions from them and

250
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,519
deploy in in homes

251
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,279
or in commercial organizations

252
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
and they have

253
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
some remote administration or remote

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,519
services that this vendor can support it

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,519
and if it turns out this vulnerability

256
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
then anyone can compromise these devices

257
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
and maybe all devices by a specific

258
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
vendor

259
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
and users of course users often

260
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
plug something in a way it shouldn't be

261
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
plugged

262
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
they click some settings that should

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,839
shouldn't be clicked and they

264
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
expose themselves to the internet and

265
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:22,880
this

266
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,080
is this is extremely common

267
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
or maybe there is solution to vulnerable

268
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
or reachable

269
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
stuff and user just

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,880
does not update software and we should

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
look into mirror and

272
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
and ask ourselves when was the last time

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
we updated software to our routers

274
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
or our iit devices or something

275
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
and and the answer usually is never

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
and what is the result result from many

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
billions there are hundreds of millions

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
hundreds of millions of reachable

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,680
devices on on one or more protocols

280
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,279
and in reality

281
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,160
maybe few millions are actually needed

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
few millions which provide

283
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
function on a network or on the internet

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,320
to the public

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,600
and that's all or we need some kind of

286
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
direct access without

287
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
cloud intermediary that is also a valid

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
valid use case

289
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,160
but do we really

290
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
want our network router to be

291
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
compromised if we are end user

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
and if our network router is compromised

293
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,760
it's

294
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
it's it's bad it means that any

295
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
any malicious actor can do anything to

296
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,640
us

297
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
steal our data inject some data in jet

298
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
malware so a lot of bad things happen

299
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
because everything flows through network

300
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,200
routers

301
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,279
and individual devices or set of devices

302
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
it does not even need to be individual

303
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,200
affects the whole regions i mean we saw

304
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
uh just uh just recently uh

305
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
fuel shortage because of hakka attack

306
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
it does not necessarily mean that this

307
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
was the cause but

308
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,279
we can expect that anything that is

309
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
exposed to the internet

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
might be compromisable we might lose

311
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
power we might lose

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,480
water we might lose fuel so

313
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
there are no good scenarios for that

314
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
case

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
and besides being compromised of course

316
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
there are other

317
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
other risks risks that there are

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
reflector software running that could be

319
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
sending

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,160
traffic uh to some victims

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,830
and and

322
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,680
[Music]

323
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
contribute to the problem or maybe there

324
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
is some proxy service running and

325
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
and the fraudsters use it to conceal

326
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
identity and use clean ip address so

327
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,839
many many options

328
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
so

329
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,959
what what is the current state or state

330
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,279
few years ago or even a decade or two

331
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,839
ago so

332
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,000
classification of devices is is very

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
old topic it's after internet appeared

334
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,680
with these consumers and commercial

335
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,959
organizations

336
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,720
the classification is under is under

337
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
let's say research topics and

338
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,000
we might know shodhan we might know

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
census these are huge

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,959
huge indexes of all devices on different

341
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,079
protocols

342
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,040
and you can click a categories there and

343
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
what will happen

344
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
will happen that there are limited set

345
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
of static rules usually few thousand

346
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,360
maybe

347
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
ten thousand and accordance to these

348
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,519
rules

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
the devices are kind of split around

350
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,639
and the issue with that is that um

351
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,279
of devices increases so there are more

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
and more devices from more manufacturers

353
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
every day there are more more different

354
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
ones

355
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
and it is not feasible

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,040
to to write manually

357
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
a lot of rules it's just it's it's

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
extremely complicated

359
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
and it operates on a data

360
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,160
that is usually referred as as banner

361
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
grabbing

362
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,160
and what it means it just means sending

363
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
a packet or two and receiving the answer

364
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
with some kind of

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
welcome message or some kind of

366
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
debugging message

367
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,399
so and and parse and process that

368
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
and it is perfect if if the rules match

369
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,600
it's perfect

370
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
it's fastest most efficient

371
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,839
classification way

372
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
except if no rule matches properly

373
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,880
then we can't classify device at all and

374
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
because of the variance of the devices

375
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
increasing

376
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
it's it's a huge problem and manual

377
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,639
classification

378
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
which is also quite quite common

379
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,279
if we have individual device uh it might

380
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,680
take

381
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
one minute or it may take an hour at

382
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
least it might take few days

383
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,720
but if there is some way to for it to be

384
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,600
classified

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
usually with active probing and

386
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,800
enumeration and

387
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,240
stuff like that an expert can achieve

388
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,519
high accuracy but i mean only for a few

389
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:59,839
individual devices

390
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
so as bruce mentioned

391
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
this is holy grail of of

392
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
application is a cyber security domain

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
because cyber expertise is common you

394
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
can take a person

395
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,279
from the university and it will and he

396
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,120
will instantly become

397
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,279
an expert it's it takes years it takes a

398
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,959
lot of

399
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,519
financial resources so to train an

400
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,079
expert

401
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
and keep him

402
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
without leaving so this is a huge

403
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,959
problem and

404
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,480
these experts are in high demand and

405
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,839
what we want we want to replicate

406
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
ideally we want to replicate experts

407
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
knowledge

408
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
and this is very let's say far away goal

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
we can't really do it

410
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
right now but what we can do we can

411
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,720
start

412
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,759
replicating some of the expertise

413
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,120
some some topic where there is knowledge

414
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
where there is intuition

415
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,320
we can work with experts to to define

416
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,040
this and

417
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,519
and train some machine learning

418
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,000
classifiers to to work on this

419
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
and even some some adoption would

420
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,719
decrease expenses and increase overall

421
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,120
security

422
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
so ai for device classification is not

423
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,199
this year's topic this topic is three

424
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,160
four years old when different teams

425
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,639
around the world started working on it

426
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
and there are two directions it's either

427
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,279
reachable devices

428
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
meaning the ones were discussed or there

429
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
are traffic flows

430
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
means there is you need some special

431
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
privileges

432
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
to to observe in a specific network

433
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,120
point

434
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
the traffic and and classify it

435
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
passively

436
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,720
and what is our goal our goal

437
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
is to close the gap between static

438
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
classification static rules and expert

439
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,199
classification

440
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,439
and

441
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
what we want to do we want to classify

442
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
large sets with expert accuracy this

443
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,880
hasn't been done ever and until few

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
years ago

445
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,359
and you want to classify individual

446
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
devices instantaneously now if you want

447
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
to classify individual device you need

448
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,919
an expert

449
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
you need many hours possibly

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,559
and here we could do it

451
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,160
cheaply and

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
quickly so

453
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,280
a year ago in cycon we presented our

454
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,559
our own research from this field and

455
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,720
we used the artificial neural network

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
we selected features we

457
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
we explained classes we explained

458
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
statistics so

459
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
if you are interested in this topic this

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
is introductory paper for it

461
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,240
and and now we build on top of it

462
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
so the challenges are extremely similar

463
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,360
to

464
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
to anything in

465
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,080
ai research it's labeling training set

466
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,918
and in this specific case

467
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
the rules become conflicting the more

468
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
you create rules the more conflicts you

469
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
find

470
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
and it means they become more complex

471
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
and more

472
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,679
uh longer and and slower so

473
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,799
you can't reasonably uh classify

474
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,200
by defining few thousand rules manually

475
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,559
it's just

476
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,200
after that few thousand it's it becomes

477
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,600
one

478
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,919
one device or a few hundred devices but

479
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
we are talking about sets of

480
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,679
hundreds of millions you can't really

481
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,640
match

482
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,080
everything and there are automation

483
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
approaches which are

484
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
which are great and there are research

485
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
that produced hundreds of thousands of

486
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
rules

487
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
but they produced it

488
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,000
in a way that every rule needs

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,880
to be manually verified to trust them

490
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
and

491
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,440
and they did not have resources we don't

492
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
have resources to

493
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
expertly analyze hundreds of thousands

494
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
of rules

495
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
so what is next

496
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,520
it's accuracy because

497
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
it is easy to show high accuracy

498
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,720
and it is somehow easy to achieve high

499
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
accuracy

500
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,440
and the question then becomes if you

501
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
have high accuracy

502
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,160
is it really high accuracy and this is

503
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,200
a kind of problem of misclassification

504
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,039
if we if we

505
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
look at the problem artificial neural

506
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
networks are black boxes so

507
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
we can't really figure out what is

508
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
happening

509
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,200
and what is the solution solution is

510
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
uh no what is challenges challenges are

511
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,200
that

512
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,159
every research in this topic claims uh

513
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,280
accuracy between

514
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,399
80 to 97 which is which is great

515
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
but if you start randomly sampling

516
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
and provide this to expert

517
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,440
he might question it and that is that is

518
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,880
the problem with every research

519
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,520
currently

520
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
available so the great example

521
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,080
that has been publicized

522
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
is there there are ics devices many ics

523
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,720
devices in many data centers so

524
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,480
why and it's it's it's

525
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
easy to answer from an expert position

526
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,679
expert says

527
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,760
either it's honeypot or there are some

528
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,919
ics devices needed for supporting data

529
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,360
center

530
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
it's and some other versions but

531
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,960
it sounds

532
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
easy but

533
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,600
why did it mass misclassify because

534
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,640
it's not trained properly maybe we need

535
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
to add extra features like data centers

536
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,640
data center identification maybe

537
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,039
the labeling maybe the labeling rules or

538
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,679
or

539
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,520
label creation was was poor quality

540
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,919
because

541
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,720
it's a huge manual labor and let's say

542
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
experts or

543
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,720
or top-level scientists don't have time

544
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,240
to deal with it

545
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
maybe features were poorly extracted so

546
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,679
there are a lot of a lot of questions

547
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,320
and what is the solution

548
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
okay

549
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,240
so first we do not know what is the

550
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,120
problem

551
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
because as we discussed it's a black box

552
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,039
we don't know what's happening

553
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,720
and if we don't know what's happening we

554
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
can't really fix anything

555
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
uh so what's the problem with

556
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
specifications so

557
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,840
in research it is okay to have bad

558
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
results

559
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,760
in science same so

560
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,159
we always want the best but we will take

561
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,039
anything

562
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,679
and if we can provide next year or few

563
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
years later

564
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
better results better accuracy this is

565
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
perfectly fine

566
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,320
this is this is research if you look at

567
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,520
let's say industry or cyber defense

568
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,240
trustworthiness is a huge huge problem

569
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,039
and i'm ignoring adversaries i'm just

570
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
talking about current state

571
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
let's let's take one scenario one

572
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
scenario there is

573
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,200
data flow this is data flow is malicious

574
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
it's encrypted so we don't really know

575
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
what's happening and it's fine to have a

576
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,600
encrypted traffic so classifier

577
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,919
misclassifies it and 97 seems good well

578
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,120
uh we have 600 flows

579
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
or 30 flows and and one malicious flow

580
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,360
so this malicious law let's say goes

581
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
through the accuracy

582
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
and of course you need defined policy

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
and this policy states that

584
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,600
let's say it's okay to have encrypted

585
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,039
traffic to web

586
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,799
but it's not okay to have encrypted

587
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,520
traffic to other places

588
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,200
and we misclassified our data got

589
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
exfiltrated

590
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,799
so false negative of not blocking single

591
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,600
instance

592
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
is catastrophic it's like it's a complex

593
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
solution and we are

594
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
kind of in in a problematic state

595
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,440
so and false negat false positive well

596
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,159
there is some usability issue but it's

597
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
it's perfectly fine so

598
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,039
how can we solve it

599
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,400
so solution is explainable ai

600
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
and it's uh by

601
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,159
let's say workflow and development it's

602
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,200
it's the same

603
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
as almost all other machine learning

604
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
classifiers so

605
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
uh what is different we different is

606
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,480
that we use

607
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
uh naive bias class model and

608
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,600
we use lime lime

609
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,039
framework for explanation so otherwise

610
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
it looks the same as as many other

611
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
work workflows for for research

612
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,679
so let's let's look at some some

613
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
examples what is our current state some

614
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,879
random devices so

615
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,840
what what does explainable ai really

616
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,960
provides it

617
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
it provides us different weights for

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
classes so highest weight is chosen

619
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,840
for classification outcome and it

620
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,559
provides us

621
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,159
weights for features and

622
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,919
weights could be positive could be

623
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
negative

624
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,880
so what would what would this

625
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,159
explanation

626
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
mean is for this device it would be

627
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,520
that it's a it's a spa device which is

628
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,559
quite common for

629
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
likely disc or something that we train

630
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
so

631
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
this is for every specific device we

632
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,600
have different

633
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,720
different weights so

634
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,360
the same the same let's say features

635
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,960
might have different weights for

636
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
for different devices in the same class

637
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
so this is kind of normal

638
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
and

639
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
so let's look at the printer but the

640
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
printer says that it's uh

641
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
hp we all know hp we know office jet

642
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,960
so this is perfectly fine and

643
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,559
what's interesting that there are let's

644
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,159
say some keywords

645
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
and some features from many different

646
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
places including autonomous systems so

647
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
the finance the finance feature is uh

648
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
is a from network name so so financial

649
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
institutions have more let's say

650
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,480
printers and

651
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,559
than other ones iot device

652
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,159
so interestingly for iot device

653
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,640
security headers are uh

654
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,279
kind of negatively weighted so iot

655
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
device

656
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
by our our model have much much less

657
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
security features and if there are

658
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,760
security features it's less likely to be

659
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
an iot device

660
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,880
interestingly there are specific devices

661
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,159
in austria

662
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,159
so a country code or

663
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,360
network name would is weighted for this

664
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
specific device which is actually

665
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
located in austria

666
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
positively

667
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
so infrastructure devices meaning

668
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
controlling

669
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
uh some kind of network or some other

670
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
non-ics features

671
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,960
and here we have a vmware horizon device

672
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
and it's it's quite

673
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
easily classified by a static rule so

674
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,000
nothing let's say surprising here

675
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
for ics device it is extremely

676
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
interesting as we see here are so little

677
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,919
features

678
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
so many features where

679
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
let's say filtered out by us as a noise

680
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,200
and what is left is is extremely

681
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,640
uh limited only for four features

682
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,720
and the analyzed analyzer it's

683
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,000
it's a spectrum analyzer but spectrum is

684
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
also let's say a network name for

685
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,640
in usa so it is weighted negatively in

686
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
this case because it's a consumer

687
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,279
network with not

688
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,840
really many ics devices

689
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,799
so network devices so

690
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,279
what do we see we see that if it's in

691
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:45,919
gateway

692
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,799
then it's it's likely a network device

693
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,960
while there are possibly other type of

694
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,080
of network devices

695
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,559
and

696
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
we have we have specific incorrect

697
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
let's say incorrect login or incorrect

698
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,640
name for a huge number of devices and

699
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,159
for this case

700
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
it is weighted as a heavy feature

701
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,039
for ib cameras we have heat vision it is

702
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,559
only software that is

703
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,600
dnr the and there is webs

704
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
it's only software that is that is used

705
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,960
in

706
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,000
in equation and no

707
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,240
other device classes uses it so it's

708
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,679
it's obviously

709
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,399
the highest weighted feature and it

710
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,320
would be the classified same way by an

711
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,559
expert

712
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,679
uh for for web server it's

713
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
it's quite clear that if we have apache

714
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
it's likely a

715
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,520
normal web server if we have uh

716
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,320
some kind of documentation description

717
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,240
it's it's a default installation

718
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
without virtual host name so this is

719
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,679
kind of

720
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,120
kind of normal and unclear

721
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,279
this and clear and categorized devices

722
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,360
these are devices that are

723
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
extremely hard to explain because what

724
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,559
we see

725
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,919
the features are very generic

726
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,760
and nothing is let's say weighted in

727
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,520
a in a highly positive way that is that

728
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,840
is

729
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,840
that could be classified by an expert

730
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
even

731
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
so overall what we see we see that

732
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,919
over the three years surprisingly ics

733
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,039
devices are

734
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,679
are in increasing numbers it's these are

735
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,399
low

736
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,200
impact devices but steals their ics we

737
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,600
have

738
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
infrastructure decrease iot is stable

739
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,239
which is great because

740
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,840
number of i.t devices increase but the

741
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,960
percentage stays the same

742
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
network devices are in decrease so this

743
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,520
is this is great

744
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,399
because network devices are the ones

745
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,679
that everyone has

746
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,720
in their homes where the cable internet

747
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,200
cable connects to

748
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,640
and ipip covers are stable

749
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,760
in decrease so there are more cloud

750
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
cloud cameras available

751
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,799
so future works is just to move on and

752
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
analyze misclassifications because now

753
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
we are transferring

754
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,360
our knowledge between uh

755
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,279
model and expert so now experts are

756
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,399
learning

757
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,279
how the ai thinks next step is to

758
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,960
transfer the knowledge back to

759
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,559
to ai and then we will see how how can

760
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,600
we improve it

761
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
okay thank you

762
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,720
so thanks very much arthur i really

763
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,159
appreciate that talk and i'm sure the

764
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,760
audience does as well

765
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,840
um i don't see immediately that they're

766
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,279
questions we should deal

767
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,360
with at this moment and so we'll move on

768
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
because i think you've given us enough

769
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
food for a thought for the discussion at

770
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,039
the end and i'd like to start off then

771
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,039
immediately with roland if we may and

772
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
roland is going to be talking about

773
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,159
um an ai powered game player for cyber

774
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,679
defense exercises

775
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,360
and it's worth noting that artur is

776
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,279
actually also a co-author on that paper

777
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
so we can clearly see there's a lot of

778
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
crossover research that gets involved

779
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,080
here

780
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,840
so roland if we may switch to you thank

781
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
you

782
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,440
thank you and i'm happy to present our

783
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,480
work

784
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,559
on this ai powered cyber defense

785
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,880
player this is as you already mentioned

786
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,760
it's a

787
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,919
joint work with art tour as well as

788
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,760
chemo heinrich from uh

789
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,880
gcd coe and luca gambati and vance

790
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
landers from arma swiss

791
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
to start let's let's imagine your your

792
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,440
job is

793
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,360
to mitigate two and a half thousand

794
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
attacks against about four thousand

795
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,120
systems that you're managing

796
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,880
so this sounds like a quite a stressful

797
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,120
job but in the end is basically what the

798
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
blue team members at log shields

799
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,600
need to do every year log shields this

800
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,880
is the world's largest

801
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,279
cyber defense exercises takes place

802
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,799
every year in talling

803
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,440
and it is a so called red team vs blue

804
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,840
team

805
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
exercise this means that there is a red

806
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,880
team

807
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
which usually which consists of the

808
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,159
attackers

809
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,000
and there are many blue teams which are

810
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,840
the defenders and usually there is

811
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
one blue team for each participating

812
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,919
country

813
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,399
we started to look at this exercise from

814
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,039
a research

815
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,840
perspective some years ago already and

816
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,399
if you

817
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,320
maybe some of you remember two years ago

818
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,600
i was presenting

819
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,720
a paper describing a system where

820
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,279
the collaborators and i we developed a

821
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,080
system

822
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,240
that could identify commander control

823
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,640
channels in the environment of this log

824
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,679
shields exercise

825
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,519
and we've shown that actually a fairly

826
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,600
simple classifier is enough

827
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
to detect large parts of the commander

828
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,200
control channels

829
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
and we also confirmed with the swiss

830
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,960
team which was participating at this

831
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,760
exercise

832
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,159
that this system actually works in

833
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,120
practice and

834
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,159
it was beneficial to them

835
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,399
for this year the colleagues as i

836
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,519
mentioned the beginning

837
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
and i we were thinking about one step

838
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,000
going one step further

839
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
and this time we don't just want to

840
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,560
provide some automated tools that the

841
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,280
blue team

842
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,560
can use to have

843
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,119
some more automation inside the team but

844
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,000
we want to have

845
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
a fully automated blue team so that's a

846
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,440
blue team where there is no human labor

847
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,918
required anymore instead everything is

848
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,599
fully automated

849
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,760
and the question that we answer in our

850
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,839
paper and in this presentation

851
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,199
is what would it take to have such an

852
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,520
fully automated plutine in the

853
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,119
presentation in the paper

854
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,159
i will present you the architecture that

855
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,159
we envision how such an automated

856
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,960
team could be implemented and the

857
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,159
component

858
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,199
which of which it is consisting

859
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,440
i will not be able to present your full

860
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
implementation or results

861
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
this is not in the scope of this paper

862
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,599
but we hope to inspire other people

863
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,400
and we ourselves we will be working on

864
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,119
this

865
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,200
more in the future and hopefully end up

866
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,960
with such an automated team

867
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
in a couple of years in a future

868
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
iteration of lock sheets

869
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,760
so when we want to automate a blue team

870
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
what would it

871
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
mean actually for this let's first look

872
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:21,920
at

873
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,240
the tasks that such a blue team would

874
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
need to perform

875
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,400
first at the very high level the task of

876
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,040
a blue team

877
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,320
is to defend its network so the

878
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
network usually reserves

879
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,240
spoken of as the game net is consisting

880
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,560
of

881
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,960
many different types of devices this can

882
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
be different workstations

883
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
with different operating systems with

884
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
different versions

885
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
uh client servers providing different

886
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,119
services

887
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,240
but also iot devices and

888
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,720
ics devices and some other special

889
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,440
devices

890
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
including things like drones and the

891
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,960
blue team

892
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,119
then needs to defend this network

893
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
against attacks

894
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,640
it does so in usually three main

895
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,280
steps first it needs to perform initial

896
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,640
hardening which means

897
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,119
to get familiar with the environment

898
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,320
with the network

899
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
and do some configuration changes such

900
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,520
that the systems

901
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
are more robust against attacks then

902
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,280
when the attack starts

903
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
the main task is mitigating these

904
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,200
attacks and restoring systems that have

905
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,480
been compromised

906
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
and at the same time the blue team also

907
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,920
needs to communicate

908
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
with other teams over predefined

909
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,960
channels

910
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,000
now this communication is maybe not so

911
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
hard for a human team

912
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,800
if we are speaking about a fully

913
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,119
automated team this will be

914
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,000
more involved of course and

915
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
communication here means

916
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,079
essentially for maintaining four

917
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,800
different

918
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
communication channels the first and

919
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
probably most important one is with the

920
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,119
so-called user simulation team

921
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,119
this is a team consisting of people that

922
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,400
simulate

923
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,480
real users so these are people that

924
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
would access websites that are hosted in

925
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,599
the game net

926
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,440
or send emails over the game net and so

927
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
on and if something is not working as

928
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,160
expected

929
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
they send a support ticket to the blue

930
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,440
team telling them hey

931
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
this is not working please fix it then

932
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,880
there is a

933
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
yellow team to which a blue team needs

934
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,040
to provide periodic reports about

935
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
the current status of the network and

936
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,760
successful and failed attacks

937
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,079
there is a wide team that uses voice and

938
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,440
video video calls

939
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,800
through the game net and there is the

940
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,960
green team providing information about

941
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,480
the current status

942
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
from a scoring perspective and it

943
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,560
provides services such as the reworking

944
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
of devices to the initial state

945
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,800
the exercise itself can be seen as

946
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,079
happening with four different stages

947
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,320
the first one that i already mentioned

948
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,359
this is

949
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,320
what is called initial hardening here

950
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,640
the

951
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
blue team typically prepares the system

952
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,240
such that they are robust against the

953
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
attacks which are

954
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,560
starting afterwards then there is the

955
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
monitoring and response phase in which

956
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,160
the

957
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
red team starts attacking and the blue

958
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
team needs to respond

959
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,359
by blocking the attacks or recovering

960
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,480
systems that are

961
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
compromised at the same time the blue

962
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
team also needs

963
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,880
to do this reporting that i mentioned to

964
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,680
other

965
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,079
teams for example the support tickets or

966
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,240
the reports about the status of the game

967
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,599
network

968
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,480
and also if nothing else helps there is

969
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,800
a

970
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
recovery stage where the system can

971
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,640
restore compromised systems either the

972
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,720
blue team can restore compromised

973
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,359
systems

974
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,320
either from its own backups or from the

975
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,960
initial

976
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,079
stakes that was provided from the

977
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,320
exercise organization

978
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,240
now looking at the framework that we

979
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,160
developed at a very high level

980
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
it looks quite straightforward we have

981
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,839
three components

982
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,960
one is input the other one is control

983
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
and the third one is output

984
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
looking at it a bit more closely the

985
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,839
input is what we call sensors

986
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,920
and these are basically components that

987
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,599
provides data

988
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,920
wherever one can collect data this can

989
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,839
be network traffic it can be event locks

990
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,079
monitoring information support tickets

991
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,320
or the credentials to access all the

992
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,440
devices

993
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,160
on the other side we have the output

994
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
which we call actuators and these are

995
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,119
components

996
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,839
that allow to perform some actions in

997
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,160
the

998
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,400
exercise environment it can be the

999
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,200
remote management of devices it can be

1000
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,960
changing firewall rules resetting

1001
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,560
devices sending

1002
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,680
chat messages and writing the

1003
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,800
reports towards the other teams in the

1004
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,280
middle

1005
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,000
we have more of the intelligence

1006
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,880
consisting

1007
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
first of a situational awareness

1008
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,320
database which

1009
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
consists which contains all the

1010
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,160
information that we have somewhere

1011
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,280
an ai engine which trains machine

1012
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,880
learning models for example and the

1013
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,920
control logic

1014
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,839
which connects the information that is

1015
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,520
there with the actions that should be

1016
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,720
taken

1017
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,480
and in the remaining of the presentation

1018
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,160
i will now go in more detail

1019
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,480
into all of these building blocks and in

1020
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
the end i will show a little case study

1021
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,119
with a concrete

1022
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,079
example of a problem that might occur

1023
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,800
and how

1024
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,839
this automated team could handle it

1025
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,280
so let's look at the sensors first

1026
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,119
sensors can be placed at five different

1027
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
positions first we consider

1028
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,680
organizational inputs

1029
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,359
everything that is provided from the

1030
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,800
exercise organization

1031
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,560
but this is for example the topology of

1032
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
the network or the device credentials

1033
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,359
then we have network sensors which

1034
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,119
provide information about

1035
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
the network device sensors providing

1036
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,839
information about all the devices

1037
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,680
connected to the network

1038
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,400
application level centers which provide

1039
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
information about running applications

1040
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,280
and finally user interaction sensors

1041
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,160
which

1042
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,079
receive all the information provided by

1043
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,720
the users of the system

1044
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,680
so i will provide a few examples now for

1045
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,000
each

1046
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,599
of these types of senders

1047
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,640
organizational inputs these are

1048
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,040
as i mentioned things like the system

1049
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
documentation

1050
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
the devices and the services that are

1051
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,839
running in the game

1052
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,119
and that should be kept running um

1053
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,960
it could include the credentials to

1054
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,760
access and configure all these devices

1055
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
it includes information about the

1056
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
scoring rules that basically define the

1057
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,440
blue team what it should do in order to

1058
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
perform well

1059
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,359
and it includes information about the

1060
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,960
external monitoring about

1061
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
which is essentially the current

1062
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,319
performance that the

1063
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,079
blue team is achieving at the current

1064
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,960
course that it gets

1065
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
second we have the application sensors

1066
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,480
which receive

1067
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
information about each running

1068
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
application such as for example for a

1069
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
database application

1070
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,000
it can be the users and their

1071
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,599
permissions what they can do in the

1072
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,640
application

1073
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,720
and it also can receive information

1074
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,560
about the application state

1075
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
such as the update status and all kinds

1076
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,599
of log files

1077
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,920
similar for the device sensors which

1078
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,800
report

1079
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
device wide information such as the

1080
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
operating system that

1081
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,960
is running device-wide logs such as the

1082
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,880
people who are trying to log into the

1083
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,839
system

1084
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,880
and it can include additional monitoring

1085
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
systems such as screen capture or

1086
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
basically whatever

1087
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,319
the blue team wants to deploy

1088
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,599
then next we have the network sensors

1089
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,880
which on one hand provide information

1090
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
about the network configuration and the

1091
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,359
state

1092
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,400
this includes like file things like

1093
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,160
firewall rules the topology of the

1094
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,319
network the lows that the network is

1095
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:48,880
currently

1096
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,040
experiencing and whether all the links

1097
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,000
are up

1098
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,240
but most importantly it also allows

1099
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,000
access to all the traffic that is

1100
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
exchanged in the network and this

1101
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,160
traffic can be captured and further

1102
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,359
analyzed in other

1103
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,920
systems for example to detect malicious

1104
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
connections there

1105
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,839
finally the user interaction sensors

1106
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,920
these are mostly about

1107
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,520
interacting with the user simulation

1108
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
team and the support tickets that it

1109
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,359
creates

1110
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,720
so we move on to the next building block

1111
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,480
of our framework this is what we call

1112
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,920
the actuators

1113
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,640
and similar to the sensors we groove

1114
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
them into four

1115
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,640
categories for network level device

1116
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,280
level

1117
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,359
application level and user interaction

1118
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,520
actuators

1119
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,560
again i will provide a few examples for

1120
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,760
application level actuators we see

1121
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,680
for example application firewalls that

1122
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,359
could be deployed such as a web

1123
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,119
application firewall that

1124
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,599
inspects all the requests to our website

1125
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,520
such application actuators

1126
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,240
can change the configuration of an of an

1127
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,079
application for example which user

1128
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,240
can perform which actions inside a

1129
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,880
database application for example

1130
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,520
and it can such an actuator can also

1131
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,160
install

1132
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,720
patches to fix known vulnerabilities to

1133
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,440
the application

1134
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,160
on the device level we see the main

1135
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,960
purpose of

1136
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,079
an device level actuators in doing

1137
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,200
remote management ideally over multiple

1138
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,480
channels such that if

1139
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,280
one of the management channels is

1140
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,880
compromised from the right team there is

1141
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
still a way to access

1142
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,359
all the devices and another purpose of

1143
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,440
device level actuators would be

1144
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,079
to restore a previous state of a device

1145
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,760
either the state that it had

1146
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
before the exercise started or from a

1147
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,359
backup that the blue team

1148
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,400
created beforehand

1149
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,319
the network level actuators these are

1150
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,359
mostly about

1151
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,440
changing the network configuration and i

1152
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
think the most important part there

1153
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,160
would be

1154
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,800
to change firewall rules that define

1155
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
what kind of traffic is allowed to go

1156
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,599
through the network at which point

1157
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,560
the user interactions user interaction

1158
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,640
actuators then

1159
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,160
would provide information to the users

1160
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
for example through chat and email

1161
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,119
messages which respond to the support

1162
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,960
tickets that we mentioned

1163
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,119
and they could generate the incident

1164
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,119
reports about successful or failed

1165
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,160
attacks and

1166
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,240
also provide them to the green team

1167
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,240
so that brings us already to the next

1168
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,839
component which is the situational

1169
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,599
awareness database

1170
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,880
here it's fairly simple this is just the

1171
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,560
collection of all the information that

1172
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,800
we have somewhere it's all the

1173
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,119
data that we receive from the sensors

1174
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,119
all the ai models that we train and

1175
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,000
which i will go into details in a second

1176
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,920
all the outputs that we send to the

1177
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,640
actuators and also external information

1178
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,280
such as

1179
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,319
known software vulnerabilities or

1180
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,680
signatures of known malware for example

1181
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,160
speaking about the ai engine here

1182
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,520
we distinguish between four levels

1183
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,079
of ai that could be there the very the

1184
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,040
most basic

1185
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,920
level is what we call reactive narrow ai

1186
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,839
and this is just simple

1187
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,920
these are just simple signature based

1188
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
decisions so taking a signature of a

1189
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,760
file and comparing it

1190
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,000
to a list of known malware signatures

1191
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,520
for example

1192
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,240
level one is called limited memory

1193
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,280
narrow ai

1194
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,359
and this is typically what this meant

1195
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,640
with machine learning

1196
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
today so this is taking a data set

1197
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,920
extracting

1198
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,760
some models from it and applying these

1199
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,920
models to potentially other data sets

1200
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,160
in a supervised or unsupervised or

1201
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,960
semi-supervised way

1202
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,359
more sophisticated would be level two

1203
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,200
which is at the same level as human

1204
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,160
intelligence

1205
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
or even more sophisticated level three

1206
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,359
which

1207
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,839
surpasses human intelligence but of

1208
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,800
course these

1209
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,960
two upper levels they don't really exist

1210
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,359
today and if they would exist

1211
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,839
we probably don't would not need to

1212
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,920
define this architecture because the ai

1213
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,680
would already do it for us

1214
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,079
so we focus in the paper and also in

1215
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,280
this presentation

1216
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,880
on level zero and level one

1217
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,400
for these types of ai that

1218
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,520
one could do we identify five different

1219
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,240
tasks that for which it could be used

1220
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,440
first it could be used for

1221
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,680
identification and classification

1222
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,839
which answers the question of what is it

1223
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,040
a certain object

1224
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,119
so for example if the object is a

1225
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,079
support ticket

1226
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,640
the identification could say it's a

1227
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,880
support ticket complaining about

1228
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,079
email is not working then categorization

1229
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,160
would answer the question what belongs

1230
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,760
together if there are money support

1231
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,319
tickets

1232
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,319
complaining about the same problem it

1233
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,240
could determine that all these support

1234
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,800
tickets

1235
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,880
complaining about problems with the mail

1236
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,920
server

1237
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,520
assessment would tell whether it's

1238
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,119
important so whether

1239
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,800
the blue team should care about these

1240
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
problems with the main server

1241
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,880
recommendation would recommend something

1242
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,599
to be done

1243
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,079
for example restart the mail server and

1244
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,920
prediction would answer the question

1245
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,000
what will happen if we perform this

1246
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,680
action for example what

1247
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,599
what would be the impact on our scoring

1248
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,960
if we restart

1249
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,920
the email server

1250
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
and i will now provide more examples for

1251
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,240
these ai tasks in all the four stages of

1252
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,520
the exercise

1253
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,400
i will only mention some individual

1254
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,440
examples here

1255
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,040
if you want to have the full table with

1256
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,119
all the tasks all the faces and many

1257
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,480
more examples

1258
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,960
please have a look at the paper in the

1259
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,880
initial hardening phase for example

1260
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,280
a categorization problem could be to

1261
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
find groups of similar devices that

1262
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,400
should be treated

1263
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
in a similar way afterwards in the

1264
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,760
monitoring and response phase

1265
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
the classification problem would be to

1266
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,319
detect malicious network traffic

1267
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,920
this is basically what we did in this

1268
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,680
paper two years ago where we

1269
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,720
classified between b9 and malicious

1270
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,000
commander control

1271
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
network traffic or a categorization

1272
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,920
problem here would be to detect

1273
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,839
malicious patterns in log files

1274
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,119
the reporting phase it's all about

1275
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:21,839
providing

1276
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,839
human readable reports so the

1277
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,599
categorization here

1278
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,720
could group support tickets together

1279
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,240
with monitoring alerts so people

1280
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
complaining about email

1281
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,599
is not working and the monitoring alerts

1282
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,839
saying that the mail server is down

1283
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,880
a categorization system could

1284
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,680
determine that these two types of

1285
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,160
information are belonging together then

1286
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,440
in the assessment

1287
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,960
an assessment problem would be to

1288
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
prioritize the most important support

1289
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,680
ticket

1290
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,559
recommendation to formulate a response

1291
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,200
to them

1292
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,520
and prediction again the for example the

1293
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,440
impact that this response has on the

1294
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,599
scoring

1295
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,079
in the recovery stage then

1296
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,280
classification

1297
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,480
problem would be to find devices that

1298
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,119
need to be

1299
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,760
recovered because they are compromised

1300
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
and the categorization problem

1301
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,720
would be to find similar devices that

1302
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,200
might

1303
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,839
uh act as a template for recovery so if

1304
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,920
for example on one windows device a file

1305
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,040
is corrupted

1306
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,680
then maybe one can take the same file

1307
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,559
from another

1308
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,720
machine and use this as a template for

1309
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,079
recovering

1310
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,440
the file on the corrupted machine

1311
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,559
so that's about ai the last

1312
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,520
block is the control logic which

1313
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
connects all the information that we

1314
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,280
have

1315
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,559
with the actions that the

1316
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,760
blue team would take again we're looking

1317
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,400
at the four phases of the exercise here

1318
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,559
first in the initial hardening the

1319
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,920
control logic would probably

1320
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,200
determine to deploy additional software

1321
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,839
such as

1322
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,000
application firewalls anti-virus

1323
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,119
software or additional monitoring agents

1324
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,760
and it could install some patches that

1325
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,599
such at all software is on the

1326
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,839
is up to date and it could change all

1327
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,440
the passwords to have a

1328
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,599
pure initial configuration of all the

1329
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,200
devices

1330
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,160
in the monitoring and response phase it

1331
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
would

1332
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,559
disable exploited services when the

1333
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
when a model for example says that the

1334
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,079
service is most likely exploited

1335
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,119
then the control logic could disable it

1336
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,359
it would monitor and block malicious

1337
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,359
system calls and to say monitor and

1338
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:31,839
block

1339
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,599
malicious network traffic on the two

1340
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,079
different levels

1341
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,480
for reporting it would generate the

1342
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,520
human readable

1343
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,839
reports either periodically for the

1344
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,599
bluet for the green team

1345
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
or when there is a request a support

1346
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,680
ticket from the user simulation team

1347
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,200
finally in the recovery phase the

1348
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
control logic could try to do

1349
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,800
self-recovery if there is a

1350
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,040
backup from from previously

1351
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,200
or it can revert the devices to the

1352
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,079
initial state

1353
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,079
over the exercise organization which

1354
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,119
would

1355
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,040
which would result also in a penalty in

1356
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,599
the scoring

1357
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,839
so that's basically all

1358
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,400
for the components of this framework in

1359
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,440
the last part

1360
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,559
i would like to show a small case study

1361
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,200
which connects all the things that we've

1362
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,599
seen before with one concrete example

1363
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,680
and the example here is that a user

1364
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,119
receives a link

1365
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,960
clicks on this link downloads a

1366
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,520
malicious file and executes this file

1367
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
and this is by the way something that

1368
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,119
this user simulation team

1369
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,520
would do and could be a problem for the

1370
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,599
blue team of course

1371
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,319
so what can we do against this or what

1372
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:46,640
could

1373
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,119
the automated blue team do against this

1374
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,119
in the initial hardening phase

1375
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,119
first it might configure all the clients

1376
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,400
to send http

1377
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,720
traffic via proxy such that this proxy

1378
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,480
can inspect the traffic

1379
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,599
second it could enable detailed logging

1380
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,160
about files that are opened or executed

1381
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,200
on a device

1382
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,760
and third it could set up the recording

1383
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,040
of all network traffic

1384
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,000
and extract meaningful features from it

1385
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
then when the attack happens or the

1386
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,240
the user downloads the file there are

1387
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,480
the three levels at which

1388
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,920
this uh attack or the potential attack

1389
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,359
could be detected

1390
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,440
first the proxy can detect that there is

1391
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
a malicious payload that the user tries

1392
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,720
to download

1393
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,000
second the logging could report that

1394
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,160
a user tries to execute a potentially

1395
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,520
malicious file

1396
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,440
and third the network sniffer would

1397
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,760
detect that

1398
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,359
device is trying to establish a

1399
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,280
connection to a commander control

1400
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,880
server and in all of these three states

1401
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,839
the system could act react accordingly

1402
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,839
it could remove the malicious payload

1403
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,480
block the execution of the file or drop

1404
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,880
the

1405
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,640
traffic towards the commander control

1406
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,880
server

1407
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,119
for reporting the system can take the

1408
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,400
information that it has

1409
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,720
the ip address from the web server where

1410
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,079
the file was downloaded

1411
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,160
maybe the name of the user the type of

1412
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,280
the malware

1413
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
the ip address of the commander control

1414
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
server that was um

1415
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
that he was trying to connect and so on

1416
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,400
and compile all of this

1417
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,440
into human readable report

1418
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,000
if the detection of the malware was not

1419
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,359
successful then

1420
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,839
the automated blue team could restore a

1421
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:26,640
device

1422
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,800
to a state before the malware was

1423
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
downloaded

1424
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,440
so with this i'm coming to the end

1425
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,240
of the presentation what i presented you

1426
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,599
today is this

1427
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,640
framework that we think would enable an

1428
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,839
automated blue team

1429
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,720
in some future iteration of log shields

1430
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,079
what i didn't present

1431
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,960
is an implementation of this or results

1432
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,400
this is because

1433
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,079
these parts are future work and um

1434
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,400
we don't think that it will be easy but

1435
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,359
do

1436
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,119
we definitely think it would be

1437
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,960
interesting to compare

1438
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,720
the performance of such an automated

1439
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,000
team with the

1440
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,400
highly professional blue team members in

1441
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,520
the normal

1442
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,920
human teams so hopefully this

1443
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,640
presentation

1444
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,880
also inspired some people to work on

1445
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,760
that as well

1446
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,119
for example also merging

1447
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,079
existing work which ex which there is

1448
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:22,880
many

1449
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,920
into this framework and implementing the

1450
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,839
missing pieces and the links between all

1451
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,359
the components

1452
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,960
of course the same framework could be

1453
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,520
adapted for other exercises

1454
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,680
and it could even be adapted to real

1455
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,599
world cyber defense even though i think

1456
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,400
they're the work that would need to be

1457
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,200
done is

1458
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,760
is much much higher than to just try it

1459
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,000
in an exercise environment

1460
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
so with this i'm at the end of the

1461
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,359
presentation

1462
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,920
thank you all for your attention and if

1463
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,520
there are questions i'm happy to take

1464
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,759
them

1465
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,359
so roland thanks very much you really

1466
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,640
shed a lot of light on

1467
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,119
what i think is is one of the the core

1468
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,720
issues that we all face within cyber

1469
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,559
defense and of course arthur's as you

1470
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:09,200
know

1471
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
uh you shed a lot of light on on some of

1472
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,720
the other details which are

1473
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,319
very much a pleasure to hear about so um

1474
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,839
before i even get to some of the other

1475
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,520
questions that we can formulate i have

1476
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,040
questions already coming in

1477
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,119
and this one is directed to you artur if

1478
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,799
you can please provide more details on

1479
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,880
how the data sets were collected

1480
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,559
in particular because so many new

1481
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,799
devices are connected to the internet

1482
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,359
how feasible is it to develop a machine

1483
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,280
learning classification model that can

1484
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,960
actually be used in real life

1485
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,319
so i think this is then the core

1486
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,359
question that that we often see from

1487
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,599
from machine learning would you like to

1488
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,280
comment on that article

1489
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,599
yeah yeah this is this is a great

1490
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,799
question and i

1491
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,480
maybe did not have enough time to

1492
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,240
explain it in detail

1493
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,240
so i mentioned that like

1494
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,559
variance or heterogeneity of devices

1495
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,119
increase and this is

1496
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,920
this has been happening all the time but

1497
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,000
now it's happening exponentially like

1498
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,760
anyone can make a device and anyone can

1499
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,599
redefine some some properties so

1500
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,799
from let's say some kind of

1501
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,559
static static rules they seem completely

1502
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,680
new device

1503
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,880
and this is actually the reason for

1504
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,160
for this and previous research that

1505
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,000
this amount of increasing devices

1506
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,280
actually hurt static rules much more

1507
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,200
so static rules can't make a good guess

1508
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,400
if for the for the new devices

1509
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,400
what we see is that

1510
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,720
like our models that we are using for

1511
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,520
three years

1512
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,160
we are kind of uh we are getting

1513
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,920
some results some guesses and these

1514
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,520
guesses are are

1515
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,160
quite quite good in in the time but the

1516
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,200
issue is that

1517
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,319
of course we need to retrain the model

1518
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,520
every every year every half year so so

1519
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,799
this is a problem we need an expert to

1520
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,480
classify training sets and it is kind of

1521
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,119
time consuming and expensive

1522
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,359
and

1523
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,680
was there any other part for the

1524
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,319
question no no i i think actually you

1525
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,400
touch on a very important uh question if

1526
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:26,960
i can

1527
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,400
take it in a different direction then

1528
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,160
arthur thanks very much for that

1529
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,920
because you you connect with the issue

1530
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,680
of having a human in the loop

1531
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,280
and this is of course very important for

1532
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,520
retraining models periodically and for

1533
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,280
monitoring models as well

1534
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,960
so i would like to uh in the time

1535
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,119
remaining maybe just make one

1536
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,200
research statement and we can see if

1537
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,960
this research statement resonates with

1538
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,079
you we'll go first

1539
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,079
to roland in a moment uh but the

1540
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,359
statement is that ai

1541
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,280
engines really are the only feasible way

1542
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,799
for cyber defenders

1543
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,880
to keep up with cyber attacks and cyber

1544
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,200
attackers just the pace of development

1545
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
and a kind of entropy argument that it's

1546
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,960
easier to break things than to

1547
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,119
fix and defend things furthermore i

1548
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,720
would say that explainable ai

1549
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,160
is perhaps um imperative for humans to

1550
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,960
in a sense accept autonomous ai systems

1551
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,880
so uh rolling we'll go to you first but

1552
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,440
i'd like to

1553
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,119
just hear if you can connect that back

1554
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,359
to whether your work is maybe a jumping

1555
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,520
off point for autonomous full defense

1556
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,400
systems

1557
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,920
and we'll unfortunately have to keep the

1558
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,440
answers short thank you roland

1559
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,520
yes so i think certainly automation is

1560
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,680
definitely needed for cyber defense in

1561
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,520
the future more and more

1562
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,000
um whether it's only this fully

1563
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,720
automated

1564
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,599
ai i think maybe in the long distance

1565
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,240
yes

1566
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,280
i think it still has a lot of problems

1567
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,359
especially if you take it outside of the

1568
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,520
exercise environment that i was speaking

1569
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,160
of

1570
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,119
if you see what r2 was mentioning with

1571
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,000
the

1572
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,559
lack of transparency in many cases of

1573
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,640
that people don't know what the

1574
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,920
ai is deciding and why so i would for

1575
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,280
quite some time

1576
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,640
i would expect not

1577
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,760
not the full trust in these ai

1578
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,880
only approaches and

1579
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,440
yeah but in the long run i think we are

1580
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,400
moving towards

1581
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,720
more and more automation can be seen at

1582
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,078
some point as on the ai

1583
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,640
very much agreed also from my side but

1584
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,400
maybe that becomes a good connection

1585
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,319
back to artur if we can uh

1586
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,559
in the in the short time remaining

1587
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,520
briefly um

1588
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,839
if you could say something about you

1589
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,559
know whether

1590
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,160
you always see a human in the loop for

1591
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,240
this or self retraining and self

1592
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,000
monitoring is part of the future

1593
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,559
so the question it what follows uh

1594
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,160
explainable ai because

1595
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,000
i think maybe something will follow

1596
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,920
something something better

1597
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,960
at the moment it

1598
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,440
it it does not work without experts

1599
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,839
things change

1600
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,359
inputs change and i see automation in

1601
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,799
this type of research and this

1602
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,280
automation is completely

1603
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,400
not transparent so if there are

1604
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,040
training sets with hundreds of thousands

1605
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,599
of of devices or hundreds of thousands

1606
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,000
with rules and this is obviously made by

1607
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,520
some kind of automation

1608
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,920
and this automation is is not clear so

1609
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,280
expert is always

1610
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,280
important and regarding uh

1611
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,319
the only way to defend that is

1612
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,680
ai or machine learning in in my research

1613
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,240
context

1614
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,799
it is a matter of time before

1615
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,040
adversaries will use

1616
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,760
device classification to find

1617
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,680
compromisable devices

1618
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,000
so we as researchers have to use it

1619
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,720
quicker

1620
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,119
and remediate these devices this is kind

1621
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,599
of the problem

1622
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,920
indeed thanks very much arthur and i

1623
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,440
regret that we have to end the session

1624
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:55,920
there it's

1625
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,599
such a pleasure starting a discussion

1626
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,359
like this and i think we'll hear more

1627
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,160
about that

1628
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,920
before i close off briefly i'd like to

1629
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,520
very quickly mention that we'll have a

1630
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,200
20-minute break now

1631
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,559
after which at 17 hours 20 italian time

1632
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,440
you may join the discussion on the stage

1633
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,160
one

1634
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,240
and that's going to be the eu challenges

1635
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,920
and outlook for cyber security in the

1636
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,359
digital decade

1637
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,920
so please join us there in closing i

1638
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,359
would like to thank you the audience

1639
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,119
everyone listening and of course

1640
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,359
you arter and roland for your excellent

1641
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,119
work and presentations and of course the

1642
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,000
discussion

1643
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,359
and i look forward to hearing from you

1644
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:35,220
next time thank you
