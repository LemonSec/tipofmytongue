equipment

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
daily like military organizations

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
also industry needs to achieve a common

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,199
operational picture

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,319
to optimize intelligence data and create

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,840
safe and successful 24 7 operation

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,280
drawn

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
very much aim it at um the military

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
something different today and i'm

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
delighted to be joined by my colleague

84

ben koenig who's uh been accelerating

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
technology for most of his career a

86
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
great expert but

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,759
welcome to you

88
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
i'm wearing you in the world uh in

germany i can say good

90
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
night because i'm sitting in the middle

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
of a thunderstorm going down on me i

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
hope you can hear me instead

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
we can burn it's a bit difficult we can

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
we can just about hear you we will

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
work through the thunderstorm and um

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
it's interesting speaking to

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
all of you at home or in the office

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
watching this burn and i spoke this

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
morning and

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
like good military officers we looked at

101
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,759
the risks we thought what can go wrong

102
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
and we actually discussed about web

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,880
interruption and

104
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
uh weather or other discussions things

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,479
so we know we can

106
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
we have some contingencies for that i'm

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
glad to say

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
so let's um tell you what we're going to

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
do today in the workshop we really want

110
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
to boost along today for you

111
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,919
to exploit next generation technology to

112
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,039
really examine

113
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,800
what is there in the market and what is

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
being used and why specifically is it

115
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
being used

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
across the world outside of defense and

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
how can that help

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
inside defense when we look as a sector

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
and i think really what we're trying to

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
focus on is the lessons for what

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
i think bern called it a brilliant uh

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
title when he said that really

123
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
uh companies like fortinet and our

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
clients operate as digital combined

125
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
joint task forces so again you think

126
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,240
about that in our

127
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
nato doctrine language which most of you

128
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
will be aware of but for those of you

129
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,759
who need a refresher

130
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,840
so combined being international

131
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
multinational

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
but also joint so very integrated uh

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
between all aspects all domains

134
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
and as a task force so properly um

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
integrated in command control and other

136
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
aspects to have the effect to defeat the

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
threat and i think you'll see

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
that today there's a lot of similarities

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,199
between that

140
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,039
and we really have a defense in depth

141
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,560
system to secure

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
the cyber domain across the world but

143
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
also specifically we're looking today

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
at how across nato a defense in depth

145
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,199
the layered system

146
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
can work and really what we want to do

147
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,600
is try and take away

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,479
three prime takeaways after today and

149
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,280
again this is

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
burnt great idea he loves the way where

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
you can say

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
why don't we tell people at the end and

153
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
at the beginning what they're gonna get

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
because then there's no

155
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
no messing around you don't have to wait

156
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
so our aim is really to make sure in 35

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
to 40 minutes and there's some questions

158
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,639
you can give

159
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
that you will know how thousands of

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
non-military

161
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
operations 24 7 365 days

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
a year operate as a digital combined

163
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,919
joint task force and really how the

164
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
modern threat is dynamic

165
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
complex but manageable and there's some

166
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
great things we'll show you on how

167
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
modern threat analysis in the industrial

168
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,280
and enterprise sectors

169
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,960
is going on every day and i think you

170
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
might be quite surprised if some of you

171
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,680
have never seen those

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
aspects and lastly how abroad integrated

173
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,000
and automated

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
network security really provides a

175
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,280
defense

176
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,680
in depth and i think bern you'll you'll

177
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,199
comment on those i'm sure but

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
i think the key takeaway there is is

179
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,800
about being the defense in depth right

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
right um because i see the

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,879
common similarity to the military

182
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,919
wording

183
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,199
and uh there is a very a

184
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,440
big advantage if he talks the same

185
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
language

186
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
and i will tell you later on

187
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
uh that i got the first time contact

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,720
with defense in depth in it the year

189
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
2007 when we started with the hecklers

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,000
project

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
but all for now that's great thank you

192
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
so i thought what we'd say is

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
who are these this strange company that

194
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
some of you may not have heard of

195
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
well i found it amazing when i started

196
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
working for fortinet as to how big but

197
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
sort of um unknown really fortnite can

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,400
be

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
and to say that as you can see on the

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
slide we're now the largest companies

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,479
this year in network security in the

202
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
world and that is largely because of our

203
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,120
obviously our market scale and the

204
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
investors are investing us they believe

205
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
in us which is great

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
but i want to really look at how our

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
technology really has allowed that to

208
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
happen and by the end of today you'll

209
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
understand why that has happened because

210
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
the system is particularly strong and

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
burn is there anything there that you

212
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,080
will

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
pick out for us any highlights there for

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
me

215
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
yeah two points so down left corner

216
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
uh the 50 integrated fabric products we

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
don't want to do a sales pitch or

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
something else don't be afraid of this

219
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
but the first time in

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,959
almost 40 years of internet security

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,920
career

222
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
i saw a fully holistic portfolio

223
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,160
and we will see later on what is the

224
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
main

225
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
benefit of this the autumn in it and we

226
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,240
will

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,519
see later on why this is so relevant

228
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
the second point uh i want to

229
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
point to is the 500k

230
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
customers wide so still growing

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
and still widen our basic

232
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
for learning and

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,880
give more ai food into the automation

234
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
yeah i agree so it's a function of scale

235
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
and size really isn't it okay

236
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
um well i think i think really also for

237
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
the delegates watching if you've not

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,440
heard of

239
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
fortnite before uh don't worry because

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
there's also a

241
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
virtual stand we've got we can talk

242
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,000
about with you during the conference but

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
we're all looking forward to a great

244
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,800
conference and i've seen the agenda

245
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
at cyclone it really does look like a

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
great show

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,519
so no uh military brief is ever allowed

248
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
without mission and concept of

249
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,079
operations so

250
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
ben and i thought we'd show you our very

251
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,160
simple but brilliant company mission

252
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
which is to secure people devices and

253
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
data everywhere

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
and it's very simple but very broad

255
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
and it means that for us we have a

256
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
global remit to try and do this

257
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
and as a concept of operations we really

258
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
do that in three

259
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,360
key advantages is what we we do and i

260
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,399
think we're going to touch on some of

261
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,839
these today because these are the things

262
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,399
that

263
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,560
burnt and i think with our military

264
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
mentality that you will enjoy seeing

265
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
today and you can think about how

266
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
some of those ideas and concepts can be

267
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
used in defense today

268
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
um and you see them at the bottom those

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,600
three there the security fabric which is

270
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
very famous but also the processes

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
and 40 guard labs we'll explain some of

272
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
those today but um

273
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
any of those are your particular

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
favorites burnt or are you uh

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
all three man

276
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
yeah as i mentioned fabric overwhelming

277
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
me because

278
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
i see from my operational responsibility

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,040
experience

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
how good this is if

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
if you have a for example a gap of

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,839
skilled people

283
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
and the gap is still growing so it is

284
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
important to have tools or a tool case

285
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
uh where alls match together

286
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
and you don't have to have uh oh

287
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,160
yeah no season for example like you with

288
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,120
different uh people to have to take care

289
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
of this exotic animals yeah i

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
and the second thing is security

291
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
processes and i

292
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
like i like to mention that fortinet

293
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,240
did from the very beginning on um

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,320
be alone uh developing and manufacturing

295
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
their own processors so we are fully

296
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
um our tag from the chinese

297
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,720
production chain so i think this is more

298
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
important than ever

299
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
well i agree thank you and um i think

300
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
really also for us to remind everyone

301
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,680
we're

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
at an alliance event we're delighted to

303
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
be with nato

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
today and this week but global

305
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,279
partnerships of course in business go on

306
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
all the time as well and these are

307
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
really important just as they are to the

308
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
nato member countries

309
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
as the nato alliances these major

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
alliances you can see on the slide there

311
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,680
in front of you

312
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
are really important to us as a company

313
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
because by

314
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
interacting with the information and

315
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
largely it's our information and

316
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
intelligence which is the driver here

317
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
but it's a whole cycle of ensuring that

318
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
tightest and best possible

319
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
net security across the world and one

320
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
thing particularly that i'd like

321
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,079
bern to talk about is the cyber threat

322
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,519
alliance can you tell us a bit about

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
that then

324
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,839
yes the cyber threat alliances was

325
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,079
co-founded

326
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
uh by foreign year 20 2014

327
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,760
and the mission is very similar to my

328
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,880
personal mission uh when i told people

329
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
in some awareness towards some

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,639
educational

331
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,360
evangelism from stage for for example

332
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,639
telecom security

333
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,240
uh i told my vision of a

334
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,839
safer internet planet is that no one has

335
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,880
to fear

336
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,959
getting victim of a cyber crime

337
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,320
we are close to this point

338
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
uh tough the criminals are very fast

339
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,360
acting

340
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
the threats are more complex and the

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,639
ability to adapt our defense

342
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
measures is very fast too on the

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,800
attacker side

344
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
but the first time in my life i feel

345
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
more than confident

346
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
that we can win this constantly ongoing

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
battle

348
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,600
now that's great that's right but i

349
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
think i think those results those

350
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,240
resources

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
that they put out i must say i was not

352
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
aware until

353
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,079
i joined fortinet as to how much the

354
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,199
resources

355
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,079
online from people like cta are there i

356
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
mean the resources archive there's a

357
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
link there on the slides for

358
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
delegates if they want to look at it

359
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
later um or when they get the slides but

360
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,000
i think

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
those resources are particularly good

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,199
for a deep dive you agree

363
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,560
yes of course and this is one of the

364
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
advantages of this alliance

365
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,480
we co-founded there that we try to share

366
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
our resulting analysis with other

367
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
members and

368
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
across all industries so to

369
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
uh to condense the time

370
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
uh of reaction the lack of time of

371
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,479
reaction we all

372
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,680
underlay in the kill chain normally

373
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
okay great so i think what we'll do now

374
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
is we'll try and take a bit of a deep

375
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
dive into what this is all about why are

376
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,880
we talking about digital task force so

377
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
let's firstly look at the situation in

378
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
typical military speak what's the

379
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,440
environment

380
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
and there are some particular freedoms

381
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
that industry has

382
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,040
compared to what defense has and if we

383
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
look at the left side

384
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
we see that we remind ourselves and

385
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
those of us who served in the military

386
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
especially those of us

387
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,399
who've been out on the front line the

388
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,240
equipment has to be ruggedized it's a

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,759
very tough environment so

390
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
small equipment like on the right is

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
just very much impossible

392
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
so also we have to have the uh

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
transparent government procurement and

394
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
that causes us a lot of problems

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
uh we may think but it's of course

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
correct and fair because this is how

397
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
democracies work in the west so it's

398
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,480
great

399
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
but also the legacy infrastructure we

400
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:57,519
have

401
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
as well to the legacy infrastructure on

402
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
a lot of

403
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,079
military and alliance platforms will be

404
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
now out of date and some of it is going

405
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
out of date so there's some severe

406
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
issues

407
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
that can be addressed in defense in a

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,240
more difficult way

409
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
than they can be in the normal way of

410
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
business and enterprise and on the right

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,880
side you can see

412
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
much more agile new generation

413
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,440
technology can come straight into play

414
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,680
and actually it can be automated and

415
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,959
integrated

416
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
very easily because that's what the

417
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
market wants so that's what they need

418
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
and if we think about what typically

419
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,800
drove technology pre-2020

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
everything way back to when both bern

421
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
and i joined and some of you

422
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
uh when we were younger there was the

423
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
cold war was finishing or

424
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,519
or certainly running and technology

425
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,920
in the whole world was driven by defense

426
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
the funding was enormous

427
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,199
and there were some amazing technologies

428
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,360
like stealth other things that came out

429
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,279
but the space race also drove it of

430
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,639
course it came out of

431
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
all that technology which we know and i

432
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
love putting this picture up because

433
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
we're very proud

434
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
in fortinet that we secure uh nasa and

435
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
the international space station

436
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
as well but what about the markets what

437
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
about where does the money come from

438
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,280
this is one thing

439
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,599
i put this slide up deliberately to show

440
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,280
just what is driving all this r

441
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
d why is it that defense is not able to

442
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
ask for things and get them when the

443
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,599
rest of the market is looking at

444
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,640
elsewhere

445
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
and that's because look at the scale

446
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,839
there well if you just take the global

447
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,520
financial service industry

448
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
it is about 15 times bigger than the

449
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
defense industry in terms of spend

450
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
and need and arguably risk as well

451
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
because they're doing live operations 24

452
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
7 of course

453
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,120
and so the spend and the drivers are

454
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,240
really going to be

455
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
in enterprise business banking and such

456
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,000
like so

457
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
defense really and it doesn't make any

458
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
of us comfortable to say it

459
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
is following and not leading in cyber

460
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,760
security

461
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
but what about industry operating as a

462
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
joint task force

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
it's definitely something that we want

464
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
to get across but

465
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
i want you to tell us a bit about this

466
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
why do you did you use this term digital

467
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
joint task force

468
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,520
because of my experience i have the

469
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,240
politician on trade fairs or something

470
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,720
else

471
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
so what is the challenge and what is the

472
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,080
pain

473
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,280
uh if you are driving a sock for example

474
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
because there was a time in 2013

475
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
to 2016 when everybody

476
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,000
this this buzzword oh we need a sock we

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
need a cm

478
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,840
uh and so on so to have

479
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,880
a universal cop so we won't have

480
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
an operator of the cyber threat

481
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,160
landscape

482
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,440
and i remember the former minister of

483
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,559
defense uh

484
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,600
dimizier who asked me so please mr

485
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
koenig tell me about

486
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
your lager build but it's a german

487
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,400
terminus for

488
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,919
uh operational picture and of course

489
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,200
you need a an overlaying

490
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,799
a universal picture with the ability

491
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,000
to drill down if having a sock so

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
if you guarantee for your company or

493
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
as a managed security service provider

494
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,360
for your customers

495
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,799
as a i.t security for their

496
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,080
infrastructure or your own

497
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
infrastructure

498
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
you have different tasks and you have to

499
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,600
have

500
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
different specialists in your team of a

501
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,760
sock for example

502
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,240
and you have to tailor the defense you

503
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
have to close the gap if you

504
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
identify that the wonder will be until

505
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,919
today

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
nothing uh is exploited in the real time

507
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,039
you have to have all knowledge about

508
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
your infrastructure

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,360
about your segmentation of your network

510
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,679
so you can

511
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,520
disrupt the attack via segmentation

512
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
your network and stop the lateral

513
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,280
movement

514
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,400
of an attacker so after this

515
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,679
you need of course a communication skill

516
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
that someone communicates okay people

517
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,559
right now you can trust again

518
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,440
the outcome don't fear that we are still

519
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,760
constant

520
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,840
no i get it i understand so really i

521
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
think what we're saying

522
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
is what the great nato aspiration of

523
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
course at the moment is for

524
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
a common operational picture combined

525
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,400
alliance common operational picture

526
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
we've achieved it of course in many

527
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
military operations to quite a high

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,080
degree

529
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
and i think back and and colonel france

530
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
lanta hammer

531
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
very kindly introduced us and i was a

532
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,240
chief of staff in kosovo for a nato

533
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
brigade and there was about seven and a

534
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
half thousand troops

535
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
and we had very big problems we had a

536
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
lot of multinational

537
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,400
interfaces and trying to build that

538
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
common in picture was very difficult

539
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,880
actually so

540
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,080
for us we found the challenges were real

541
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
time and a bit like burnt said there's

542
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
this multi-agency

543
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
the zoo he talked about lots of

544
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,799
different animals trying to

545
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,640
work together it was very difficult and

546
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,159
alliance operations

547
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,320
are difficult so the technology in

548
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,760
industry is used

549
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
to make sure that those fault lines if

550
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,280
you like disappear

551
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
and there those gaps are closed and

552
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
cyber of course is

553
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,159
is in conflict it's a live conflict

554
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,080
every day it's just a difference

555
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
in intensity going on so i think the big

556
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
thing we all need and i always needed it

557
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
in my military career

558
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
you'll all be aware of it is that

559
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,039
situational awareness

560
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,039
we get that from a good cop common

561
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,159
operational picture

562
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
but also we want that in the industry as

563
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,480
well for all our clients if you're the

564
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
chief executive of a bank you expect

565
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
your bank to be seeing visibly all the

566
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,760
threats

567
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
and be able to mitigate them every day

568
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
and that's all around the world wherever

569
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
that bank is operating

570
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,280
so it's a very similar analogy of what

571
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,799
we're using and of course that gives you

572
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,919
in any crisis

573
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,799
or near crisis great advantages to lead

574
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,400
and commander control

575
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,159
and that's why we think this great turn

576
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,080
that bern thought of comparing it to the

577
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
digital's combined joint task force

578
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,840
makes it i think easier for us all to

579
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,919
understand what is going on and we'll

580
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,880
talk a bit about that

581
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,520
in detail in a few slides time but the

582
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
one thing we have got

583
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,520
is the fortinet security fabric which

584
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
effectively has a layer

585
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,039
of multiple products that all integrate

586
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
and talk together which is unique in the

587
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,440
market

588
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
and that gives the classic layered

589
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
network security system so

590
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,919
just like since ancient times a layered

591
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,200
defense is better

592
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
than a single line of course so i think

593
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
we've said enough really about the

594
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,320
common operational picture

595
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
but i think also what we can do is try

596
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,919
and look and

597
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
it's going to tell us a bit about it to

598
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,039
look at the

599
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
industry again how do they particularly

600
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
operate and how do some of those things

601
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
work

602
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,039
tell us a bit about it yes

603
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,240
as i mentioned before it is a big

604
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,679
requirement and a great challenge to

605
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,880
um design the defense process

606
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,159
if you have limited amount of heads so

607
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
as i remember as i was the operational

608
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,640
responsible

609
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
for the data centers inside german i'm i

610
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
had the feeling

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
um any anyway

612
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,360
anyhow how many people i got as

613
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
it was ever too less because um you had

614
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,880
an

615
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,080
all-day uh changing target

616
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,760
and an all-day um

617
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
ever going same task

618
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,440
to protect your environment

619
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
and uh this against an attacker seen

620
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
who was very agile

621
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
uh with a complex and unknown attack

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,440
vectors for example so

623
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,720
it was difficult

624
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
to get ahead of your daily

625
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
stressful business into a planning

626
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,000
process to answers

627
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
hands washing suits of your teams

628
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,080
and so there was a

629
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
process um design

630
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,799
necessary to get lean enough

631
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,400
to react fast enough so

632
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,919
in time we're this 2047

633
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,679
operation of protection against

634
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,520
internet cybercrime um our

635
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
threat intelligence platform which is uh

636
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,159
provided by 40 god labs is

637
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,520
so amazing they are so far

638
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,279
ahead produce lots of research

639
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
outcomes who get indirectly

640
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,200
into intelligence and the uh beneficial

641
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
co-working and automation of our

642
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,120
security

643
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,159
architecture tell it um that

644
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
for example suns are able

645
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,559
to get rid of boring routine of the

646
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,520
always same incident response handling

647
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,720
because my grandma

648
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
clicks every day on the same phishing

649
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
button yeah so

650
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
this is not what a threat researcher

651
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
wants to do

652
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,520
another point to hold your people

653
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
with an interesting job and keep them

654
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
away from

655
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,559
leaving your team to another team yeah

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
who are

657
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
signaling oh we are poor and our job is

658
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
more interesting for example

659
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
so all the overlaying

660
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,919
aim and mission is to keep ahead of the

661
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
enemy as i told before

662
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,799
and i'm confident we can do it right now

663
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,640
i think chris will

664
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
leave one sentence on the c4i star

665
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
advantages

666
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,799
and i leave this slide

667
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,840
with again these four

668
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,159
steps tailor the defense close the gap

669
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
trust the outcome

670
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,640
and yeah you have disrupted the attack

671
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,559
so you were successful

672
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,679
and as we know it from our military

673
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,720
principles

674
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
gets the most access with the

675
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
least effort and damages but

676
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,760
chris you want you wanted to say

677
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,799
something for the

678
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,840
c4i star yes i did thank you but i just

679
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
think remembering my time when i was in

680
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,720
the military on operations the most

681
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,240
difficult piece was always to

682
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
find what was going on that find

683
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,880
function and of course we call it i-star

684
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
c4i star

685
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,520
in a military expression but when it

686
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,679
comes to reconnaissance or finding out

687
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,960
there are a few things better than the

688
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
amazing fortiguard labs and things that

689
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,799
we'll talk about and we'll show a few

690
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,240
slides of that shortly

691
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,159
but actually i think just to remember

692
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,240
that for the commanders they want to see

693
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,200
that clarity

694
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
that single pane of glass as we call it

695
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,520
the common operational picture

696
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
as the military aspires to and i think

697
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,279
this is one of the great strengths of

698
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,240
the digital

699
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
combined joint task force that is going

700
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
on every day outside the military

701
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,000
so we said about star franchises let's

702
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
have a look at a few of those staff

703
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,400
branches because

704
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
intelligence we all know as j2 in the

705
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
military community the challenges there

706
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,240
are always the same doesn't matter since

707
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,279
you're back to

708
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,919
roman or medieval times how can you get

709
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,000
that accurate intelligence

710
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and i think really also a big challenge

711
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,559
is the zero day concerns what happens

712
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
when something happens

713
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
elsewhere in your battle space or your

714
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
environment or across the alliance in

715
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
nato's terms

716
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,159
how can we instantly automatically keep

717
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:34,960
up with that

718
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
and of course humans human beings being

719
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
a limiting factor because

720
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,679
humans in the loop we know are something

721
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,480
that actually

722
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
doesn't always help us as fast and as

723
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,000
automatically

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,559
as a good system so i've asked ben just

725
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,840
to say a few things about some of the

726
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,879
solutions for this

727
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,880
yes uh you can see on the on the left

728
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,799
side the uh the left and the middle row

729
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,919
a typical gain where all

730
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
phases of the skill chain were affected

731
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
and handled or managed successfully

732
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,039
touched by 40 net security

733
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,960
fabric elements and you can see

734
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
the after the point of delivery as a

735
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,200
forty guard anti-malware protection for

736
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,320
example

737
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,960
how many modules how many portfolio

738
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,760
elements

739
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,039
are working together and are affected

740
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,159
to bring this

741
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,880
malware up to uh attention for example

742
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
for the threat researcher who is looking

743
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
on the screen but

744
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,559
before he gets into the situation

745
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,520
to identify is it false positive real

746
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,080
and

747
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,360
how i have to react and uh

748
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,559
have i have i uh to

749
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
shift it to my supervisor for example

750
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,960
the biggest skill

751
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,960
yeah you can see there are many sections

752
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,240
um for example 40 sandbox okay

753
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,120
box is not rocket science um the

754
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,760
difference

755
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,159
is inside um how fast is a sandbox

756
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,240
how accurate is it uh identifying

757
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,840
suspicious not known anomalies for

758
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,720
example

759
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,399
and then uh i want to point out 40 ai

760
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,760
and if you have doubts is it ai

761
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,440
because everyone is driven driving the

762
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,080
um

763
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,440
the buzzword ai today and if you

764
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,640
inspect deeper you can see oh this is uh

765
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,440
only machine learning so our 40 ai

766
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,039
is about eight years and is able to read

767
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,360
and

768
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,720
to learn and is based on deep learning

769
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
and supervised

770
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,960
learning if you want to have more

771
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,159
information about

772
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,200
this you can contact us in our booth

773
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,399
later are of the um

774
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,679
the whole days of the conference we

775
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,600
are there with

776
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,120
skilled people to

777
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,039
get answering your questions so um

778
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,799
and so on and see that we are

779
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,159
um dividing this um after

780
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,080
exploitation installation types about uh

781
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,279
is an attacker

782
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,640
using his advantage when he

783
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,000
so then is the point for action a call

784
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,120
for action

785
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,880
uh you know this uh word and there are

786
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,159
uh three basically

787
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,360
uh big structured elements

788
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,039
here the 40 guard ioc the 40 analyze and

789
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,919
the 40c

790
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,200
so working together don't forget all

791
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,799
under operating system with the

792
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,000
main benefit and the big advantage

793
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,279
that there are to

794
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,960
mesh automated um formation extra

795
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
which are you know the benefit and

796
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
advantage of pig's

797
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
power much more faster than

798
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,519
inside a human acting reacting or

799
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
uh sleeping um guy who

800
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,320
is after six or seven hours

801
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,440
uh not aware of

802
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,760
a very good hidden exploit for example

803
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,960
on the right side you can see

804
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,159
a small picture where we can see

805
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,760
our thread uh

806
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,720
yeah i can we can say cop it's a real

807
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,159
threat landscape

808
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,399
um picture and the next slide will

809
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,440
uh this much more detailed and we can

810
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,120
start the video on it can you

811
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240
click on this yeah thank you very much

812
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,120
and um if we start the

813
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
video which i

814
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,519
took last thursday i think

815
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,720
just to make sure that under the

816
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
uh the mystery live performance see

817
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
what's going on

818
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,840
in the world and you are able if to

819
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,760
click on the link for yourself in your

820
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
browser

821
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
to click in a country

822
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,919
a country for your interest for example

823
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,320
united states is

824
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
more ongoing than in estonia which i

825
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,159
started with

826
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
they are us and germany yeah it's quite

827
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,080
calm last thursday but you see what

828
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,200
exploits what

829
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,880
male where what ddos attacks what bot

830
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,559
armies are

831
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,440
on the way so this is a based of our

832
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,640
uh infrastructure we are deplo we have

833
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,519
deployed

834
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,279
to our more than 500 thousand customers

835
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,640
and this these are feeding

836
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,399
um this threat landscape of course

837
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,440
you can dig in deeper and

838
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,559
uh if you want to see more or you want

839
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,840
to get a member

840
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,880
of the cyber threat alien where you can

841
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,519
share

842
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,279
and can benefit of the shared security

843
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,480
information

844
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,399
then please contact us we will lead you

845
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,720
to the people who are in charge for this

846
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,919
so all all of this information including

847
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,840
the visualization

848
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
habits of cyber security

849
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
are doing this great work

850
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,159
so this for now um

851
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,918
chris you can go on with the next slide

852
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,879
please

853
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
thank you yeah i just i mean i just

854
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,399
think that whole sequel

855
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
fantastic it's great to hear and great

856
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
to listen to because

857
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,159
i think one thing that the delegates can

858
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,560
can do

859
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,199
okay

860
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,639
so i think the big thing for us to look

861
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,000
at is that those intelligence and

862
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
assessments a lot of it is free online

863
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,359
so i would urge anyone

864
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,679
who's working in nato or in any of the

865
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,359
member nation militaries to sign up

866
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,079
online

867
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,839
to the alerts from fortiguard labs

868
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,520
because they have the best

869
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,159
intel feed on the planet uh as bern

870
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,359
reminds us from over

871
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,918
half a million users going every day as

872
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,879
to what's happening in the light

873
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,680
intelligence

874
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,720
i think it's now over six million assets

875
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
and that is bigger than the rest of the

876
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,119
the competition behind us combined so

877
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,400
we're very lucky to have that but

878
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
there's the true expertise that you'll

879
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,560
enjoy

880
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
and the reports and i've taken a

881
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,920
snapshot on this slide of

882
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,839
just one of the many reports that came

883
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,280
out on a regular feed

884
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,000
about the big colonial pipeline a recent

885
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,920
incident in the united states of america

886
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
and i only choose that because that was

887
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,119
one that i know a lot of us were

888
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,920
interested in

889
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760
and straight away i knew i could from my

890
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
desk have a look at what was going on

891
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,240
with the very

892
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,480
best intelligence available and that is

893
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
something we all know in military

894
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
world is is absolutely vital it's what

895
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
we need

896
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:40,880
so i think really we're just going to

897
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,720
touch on another couple of staff

898
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,640
branches and then make some conclusions

899
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,920
for you today

900
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
other ones really logistics there are

901
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,040
some big challenges and again there have

902
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,079
been historically

903
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,480
if we think back to major conflicts the

904
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
logistics is always the weak underbelly

905
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
it's the weak part

906
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,079
of a military armor and that's the same

907
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,920
in business but also the same of course

908
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
in the military

909
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
and the real risks to this i can say i

910
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,599
know were profound when i was

911
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,119
chief of staff in kosovo we were

912
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,359
particularly worried about our fuel

913
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,720
because our fuel depots were very thinly

914
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,359
um sustained and if we had any problems

915
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
there with sabotage or something

916
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
then we would be in big trouble and

917
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,960
today i would have had to have been

918
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,839
worried about

919
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,760
electronic interference with that supply

920
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
chain and so that the problem has got

921
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,320
bigger

922
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,480
so the need for security and other

923
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,560
assets of course got bigger as well

924
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,760
yes this is my part here

925
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,359
i see um i wanted attention to

926
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,640
the whole process check and

927
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,960
as we know we can't do it always

928
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,320
only enhanced this is imp so and more

929
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,520
are parties companies uh

930
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,119
included into the process of

931
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,839
bringing the goods into for example

932
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,720
foreign mission

933
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,839
to our troops and

934
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,680
it's good to have a single pane of glass

935
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,320
and an automated approach for an animal

936
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,160
detection think about the subject

937
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,839
of an not a

938
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,119
deeply inspected supplier in your supply

939
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:31,680
chain

940
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,160
so an attacker

941
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,720
we'll know where is the wheels ling in

942
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
the chain

943
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,880
and uh so if you're an

944
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,560
arriving destination yeah

945
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,000
all goods

946
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
our troops need uh in in

947
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
their mission operation area

948
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,359
uh yeah there's uh not only food

949
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,800
this is uh anything else

950
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,359
and of course you will think on on the

951
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,560
loop paper

952
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
uh then you can think yeah okay germany

953
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
doesn't need tech

954
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,400
they need only a pandemic to get stuck

955
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,359
with this

956
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,720
uh but it was the same when you have

957
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,320
your warrants the same everyone ran out

958
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,839
of the loot paper yeah

959
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,720
okay okay so um yeah it's not the

960
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
glorious moment

961
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
we can talk about but what we can talk

962
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,000
about and what is

963
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,440
really really exciting um that

964
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
all risk security responsible people

965
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,640
who want to know how secure

966
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,680
is my chain and uh

967
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,960
where do i have to get more attention

968
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,560
to secure for example this weak link

969
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,160
and where to put in more sensors

970
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
for example then you are

971
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,119
still at least at the same level

972
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,400
as your attackers i want to be ahead of

973
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,960
them

974
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,880
and with all combined

975
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,520
um tasks forces we are able to

976
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,599
join i think we are still ahead

977
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
yeah that's great i think really it's a

978
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,440
it's a great point and also

979
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,320
we never have enough uh troops or assets

980
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
for securing the rear operation

981
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,320
it's like a fundamental of warfare

982
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
however the ability to secure the rear

983
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,320
operation automatically

984
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,280
with technology removes that problem so

985
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,680
there's an

986
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,160
enormous scope for securing the rear

987
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
operation without the usual penalty of

988
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,079
an enormous amount of resources so

989
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
this is the truly exciting thing and i

990
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
want to just task john one last branch

991
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,040
before we

992
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,599
uh start to finish off the workshop and

993
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,599
take any questions so do think about

994
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,480
any questions uh in the in your chat is

995
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,440
the

996
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,520
j6 this is the communications part of

997
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,119
course is going to be part of a cyber

998
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,000
presentation

999
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
but let's just think about that what is

1000
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
yet to come about the internet of things

1001
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,760
the amount of sensors the 5g

1002
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,160
network is going to increase everything

1003
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
in our lives including in the military

1004
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,119
domains

1005
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,040
so the increased attack surface will

1006
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,520
need that increased need

1007
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,599
for automated integrated broad

1008
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,040
technology which is what

1009
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,119
we always live by that in fortinet to

1010
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,640
give that through our fortinet

1011
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,880
security fabric and burns just going to

1012
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,079
tell us a bit in a moment

1013
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,839
about that but before that i just want

1014
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,119
to tell you all about

1015
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,640
what's happening in some parts of

1016
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,319
fortinet where in

1017
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,359
in the uk we've managed to get secure

1018
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,920
sd1 and sd branch for example

1019
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,480
accredited to classified level so it can

1020
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
be used to remotely work

1021
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,880
up to highly classified levels because

1022
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,520
it's been

1023
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,000
seen as so secure that it's acceptable

1024
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,839
to do that now that is a bit of a game

1025
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,480
changer

1026
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,720
for a lot of deployed headquarters for a

1027
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,640
lot of remote assets

1028
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
for aircraft forces but also the ability

1029
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,400
to send

1030
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,280
multiple levels of classification over

1031
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
one pipe

1032
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,599
if you're interested in that sort of

1033
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,440
technology and what that might do

1034
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,160
it's quite fun to talk about do try

1035
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,400
visit the stand or ask us and we'll try

1036
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,520
and get back to you and tell you about

1037
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,680
it it is truly exciting

1038
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,599
and burn i'll ask you just to tell us a

1039
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,880
bit about it but also ot

1040
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
yes thanks chris this is um what i

1041
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,359
want to mention uh and one of the last

1042
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,800
slides here is

1043
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,079
all the experience we could make

1044
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,160
about the last 20 25 years with it

1045
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
and i.t security um it's

1046
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,640
it's very good covered all over

1047
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,599
and especially very well protected by

1048
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,359
our fortinet security fabric

1049
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,480
with all the advantages i i told you at

1050
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,440
chris told

1051
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,560
uh too so what now with

1052
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,760
ot and uh the former known as iot

1053
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
yeah the internet of things and now

1054
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,640
operational technology

1055
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
my uh feeling and my

1056
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,280
impression is that we are

1057
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,400
going to make at least

1058
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,839
at least the same

1059
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,720
mistakes as we did

1060
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,079
25 20 with it and the learning

1061
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,920
curve is not transmissioned

1062
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,680
and transported to the old

1063
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,280
responsible people and why because they

1064
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,119
don't like the language and they are

1065
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,640
very and

1066
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,920
uh if you are struggling now okay what

1067
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,319
what

1068
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,640
is ot in my in my military environment

1069
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,720
our weapon systems are very well

1070
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,040
protected yes of course

1071
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,480
because maybe this was part of the

1072
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,359
the process when uh the tender king went

1073
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,079
out and

1074
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,119
there were some sections how to protect

1075
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,200
the unified temple against cyber

1076
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,280
maybe he is very well protected but

1077
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,960
think on the example

1078
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
um what about the fuel pump on an

1079
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,160
airfield with building automation

1080
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,440
what is evolved

1081
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,280
over the last 40 years

1082
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,040
renovated and redesigned and put in some

1083
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
cables and put in some

1084
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,160
batch readers for entry uh

1085
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,319
access management for example and what

1086
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,680
about the fuel pump

1087
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,200
you can secure your eurofighter as much

1088
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,560
as your budget is able to give but

1089
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,240
if you don't secure the fuel pump

1090
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,079
which is remotely accessible because

1091
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,680
for example service measures um

1092
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,720
this will be the weakest link and with

1093
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,680
no fuel

1094
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,960
no eurofighter starting so

1095
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,079
this is a point when i

1096
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,040
talk to people military leaders of

1097
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,160
course too

1098
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,440
when they say oh wow yes you're right

1099
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,480
and um i see that there

1100
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,839
is a big discussion right now started

1101
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,880
i'm very happy

1102
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,480
that the discussion started because we

1103
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,000
don't dare um to sit this out as we say

1104
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
in germany yeah

1105
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,319
so we can't wait until we are

1106
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,560
broken on the floor because things to

1107
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,960
renovate after uh total

1108
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,240
will yeah some say it's good

1109
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,480
to to to build something new from

1110
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,520
scratch on

1111
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,079
but uh if you are in a crisis for

1112
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:44,960
example

1113
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,319
when this is used you are um

1114
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,520
yeah desperately um over overwhelmed

1115
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,240
visits

1116
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,680
to do at the same time so this is my

1117
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,880
um my special topic with otp

1118
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,359
and let me tell you that the fortinet

1119
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,800
security fabric

1120
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,839
is securing ot uh at the same

1121
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,400
significantly high security level as

1122
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,359
know it from it if you are using sucks

1123
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,640
right now

1124
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,560
last

1152
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,760
14 months during the pandemic home of

1153
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,560

1154
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,599

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,760
nse certification um you get

1157
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
very good made uh content

1158
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,800
and you can

1159
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,400
decide for yourself when

1160
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,480
and how long you get your input

1161
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,319
and compare this to even non-profit

1162
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,000
organ like ic square

1163
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,960
or izaka for example uh normally you

1164
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
have to pay a lot of money

1165
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,640
that's one obstacle more yeah you have a

1166
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,000
supervisor will you

1167
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,839
give me money for this and he will tell

1168
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,079
you okay next year that is here for this

1169
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,400

1170
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,119
this is so great that you can

1171
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,079
one more far away only power one mouse

1172
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,040
click far away

1173
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,760
you can can get very good um well

1174
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,119
prepared content

1175
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,319
to build up your skill absolutely and i

1176
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,760
must say i really enjoyed it as well and

1177
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,960
i couldn't believe the different

1178
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
levels and the depth of it that is

1179
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,800
available it's uh it's truly impressive

1180
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,599
but um

1181
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,599
for us all today i hope that's been

1182
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,599
useful and i just wanted to reflect back

1183
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,000
uh

1184
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
for everybody um just on what we offered

you this slide of course we showed you

1186
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,160
at the beginning about the takeaways

1187
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
we wanted to show you how thousands of

1188
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,400
large organizations across the world

1189
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,760
protect themselves 24 7 as a digital

1190
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
combined joint task force which is what

1191
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,920
the military are aspiring to do and to

1192
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,480
be

1193
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,240
they want to get a common operational

1194
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
picture but that is available we've

1195
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,280
shown you that

1196
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,520
through fortiguard labs it is manageable

1197
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,319
daily and

1198
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,640
is done so by organizations around the

1199
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,000
world so the technology is

1200
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,319
there today tomorrow's technology is

1201
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,440
available today

1202
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,040
and we're delighted to talk to you about

1203
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,559
that should you need to on the

1204
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,920
conference or after

1205
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,079
and also the last point really is about

1206
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,280
the fact that it's

1207
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,000
a broad integrated and automated network

1208
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,680
security we offer

1209
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,520
and we believe that is the modern day

1210
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,000
defense in depth it is the layers the

1211
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,800
levels

1212
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,880
of defense that are needed with the

1213
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,800
rising threat and we have

1214
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,040
um the virtual booth here at sidecon to

1215
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
talk about it more and you can get in

1216
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,200
touch with

1217
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,440
ourselves or any of our experts if you

1218
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,040
wish to in your home countries

1219
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,280
and also at nato we have an account

1220
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,079
manager

1221
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,559
corrine vanderpuds who's in brussels as

1222
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,440
well

1223
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,119
and she'll be able to contact you if you

1224
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,720
need any more on any of this

1225
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,440
through the email you see on the screen

1226
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:37,920
there

1227
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,839
but thank you burnt for your your help

1228
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,520
today hope you enjoyed doing it today

1229
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,839
with me

1230
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,880
yes thank you very much both of you for

1231
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,000
your

1232
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,200
very engaged presentation uh i have

1233
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,280
uh one or two questions if you may we

1234
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,400
have about uh

1235
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,520
attention yes of course chris and

1236
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
i love the picture on this slide uh if

1237
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
you are both sided

1238
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,800
bulk like the which ones of the row

1239
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,240
so uh and hopefully

1240
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,400
yeah okay

1241
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,680
thanks again uh chris and bernd

1242
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,880
for your engaged discussion right now

1243
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,520
i have we have about five to ten minutes

1244
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,079
time for

1245
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,160
for one or two questions i have one from

1246
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,280
major hales demir

1247
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,240
who is asking 5g is going to be used

1248
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,599
widely

1249
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,240
soon and it contains many cyber security

1250
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,680
risk in it

1251
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,480
so does fortinet have any projects or

1252
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,839
products related

1253
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,200
with 5g security

1254
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,119
yes thank you france i'll let bert say a

1255
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,640
short while i know we're short for time

1256
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,559
but the answer is yes and fortinet have

1257
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,680
just brought out

1258
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,800
the fastest uh firewall in the world

1259
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,880
just to cope with the accelerated need

1260
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,280
that 5g with the additional bandwidth

1261
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,040
and so we do have that we have that

1262
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,559
those projects for that

1263
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,640
those are very transferable of course

1264
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,000
for military technology

1265
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
so the answer is yes but it's going to

1266
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,839
be such a great challenge for all of us

1267
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,200
i don't know if you've got any more

1268
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,839
burnt to add to that

1269
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,359
yes i have i have a number for this

1270
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,559
because i know a tender right now uh

1271
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:35,920
here in germany

1272
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,640
where we have the requirement to get an

1273
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,599
reaction time

1274
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,599
inside of a firewall of four

1275
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,079
microseconds

1276
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,119
uh and this is needed for uh for example

1277
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,000
5g

1278
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,839
on a compass and uh yeah as chris said

1279
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,640
we have the fastest firewall and we have

1280
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,040
the

1281
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,319
only one who is able to react in four

1282
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,680
microseconds thank you

1283
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,839
another question was you were talking

1284
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,160
about the j2

1285
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,319
j4 and j6 staff elements

1286
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,200
which are mainly there to influence the

1287
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,960
operational picture

1288
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,200
what is with other elements including

1289
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,000
social engineering and this information

1290
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,800
how do they

1291
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,640
influence the operational picture

1292
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,839
yes that's a very good point i mean

1293
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,440
there are other staff branches which we

1294
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,240
didn't cover because of time such as j1

1295
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,839
manpower and those sort of pieces where

1296
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,559
um

1297
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,319
they will be covered by the cso phil

1298
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,720
quade is our ceso and he's speaking on

1299
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,559
thursday he's going to talk about that

1300
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,559
with uh manpower needs and how we can

1301
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,880
upskill all of us in the military

1302
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
and in the rest of the sectors as well

1303
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,640
so that'll be useful for those of you

1304
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,040
on that when you mentioned about social

1305
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,720
engineering and the other factors and

1306
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,520
influence operations i see that as we

1307
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
are part of that solution of course

1308
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,160
where we

1309
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,400
are the technology part of that solution

1310
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,079
but i i would argue that if

1311
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,960
you know that your opponent has got the

1312
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,640
best technology on earth

1313
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,800
and the best security then you are less

1314
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
likely to go and attack them

1315
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
you might try and attack elsewhere so i

1316
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,960
think by its very nature

1317
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,680
the ability of tight security starts to

1318
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,359
deflect some of these other problems you

1319
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,079
mentioned

1320
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,359
but i don't know if you've got anything

1321
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,319
to mention on that as well

1322
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,800
yeah i agree and when i think on the

1323
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,599
staff elements and you're right we were

1324
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,720
lesser time um j1 for example

1325
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,359
personal leading your personal is a part

1326
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:37,760
of

1327
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,280
a staffing rule and of course of them

1328
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,400
hold skilled people and educate them so

1329
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,480
and this is the next step element

1330
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,760
j3 for example exercise training

1331
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,880
education

1332
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,800
so if you see all these dev elements are

1333
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,680
of course still joining together as a

1334
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,800
task force

1335
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,480
and we um draw your attention today

1336
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,800
on the more technical aspects and as

1337
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,760
chris told

1338
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,680
uh listen to phil's keynote and thursday

1339
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,800
and you will see the social

1340
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,640
um aspects of this digitalized

1341
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,720
digitally evolving world

1342
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,760
thank you so much a last question maybe

1343
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,400
with a short answer it could be a long

1344
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,920
answer but i hope you have a short

1345
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,200
answer to that

1346
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,680
comparing military and industry combined

1347
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,359
joint task force you

1348
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,160
explained all the similarities but what

1349
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,000
do you see as the main difference

1350
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,520
between the military side

1351
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,720
and the industry side yeah it's a great

1352
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,559
question in a very short answer

1353
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,319
um if i think back to that slide about

1354
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,839
the challenges we have where we showed

1355
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,760
the wrist watch versus the heavy

1356
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,319
radio i think it's in the procurement

1357
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,000
and that's one of the biggest challenges

1358
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,839
uh we have great enterprise agreements

1359
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,680
that allow excellent value

1360
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,440
longer term engagements these are the

1361
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,839
things that are going to be more useful

1362
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,000
going forward and those are not done by

1363
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,760
the military at the moment but they are

1364
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,960
done by civilian

1365
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,040
joint task forces the banks and the big

1366
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,000
enterprises

1367
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,839
and other companies so i think one of

1368
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,280
the biggest challenges is going to be in

1369
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,720
that commercial side

1370
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,880
uh the technology is going to be shared

1371
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,559
but the commercial part is one of the

1372
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,839
biggest challenges for the military

1373
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
today

1374
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,960
yeah again very great insight

1375
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,400
