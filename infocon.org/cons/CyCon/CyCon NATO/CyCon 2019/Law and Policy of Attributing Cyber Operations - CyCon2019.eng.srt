1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,520
everyone for joining us this is an

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:07,830
exciting session and I think although

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,500
even though we're in just the first day

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,440
of saikhan it wouldn't be premature for

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,130
us to congratulate CCDC OE on yet

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,430
another superb event if like me you're a

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,970
follower of their event and and their

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,880
work mmm you'll know that the subject of

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,269
this panel has been one of a consistent

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,969
strain throughout their events the

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,309
problem of attribution if you look at

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,070
the early versions of the event I think

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,680
which you see are relatively siloed or

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,110
stove-piped approaches to attribution

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,460
early on I think the various communities

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,680
involved in cybersecurity

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,110
each realized they had perhaps a

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,019
peculiar or particular perspective that

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,050
is from the technicians there was I

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,210
think a logical focus on the digital

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,230
forensics that are involved in a cyber

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,290
attribution effort from the from the

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,408
political track of course there was

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,600
interest in the political will or the

25
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,850
diplomatic climate that surrounds an

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,158
effort to do a cyber attribution and

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,929
then finally the community that I come

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,939
from that I'm most familiar with

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,710
we international lawyers explored what

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,320
attribution meant to us and of course I

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,380
think cyberspace and and the the

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,110
conversations we've seen ATS icons have

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,789
to some extent resurrected our interest

34
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,500
in the articles of state responsibility

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,170
how international law and how states

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,060
have agreed to assign responsibility for

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,390
internationally wrongful acts this has

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,799
led to us I think two helpful

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,500
discussions and elaborations on notions

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,720
like control what does wielding

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,270
effective control over a non-state actor

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,030
mean how can States assign

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,610
responsibilities among organizations in

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,280
a way that holds them responsible under

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,469
applicable international law but there's

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,740
a flaw of course to these stove-piped

47
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,658
efforts or these siloed efforts it seems

48
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,329
to do the to do the real work of

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,759
attribution requires an intersectional

50
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,230
effort that these are cross-disciplinary

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,549
efforts and so in that vein

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,379
we have presentations from three

53
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,450
panelists that I think will emphasize

54
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,739
that the theme you will find in each is

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,409
an effort on the part of an

56
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,489
international lawyer in each case or a

57
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,109
policymaker

58
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:29,120
to weave together the technical the

59
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,620
political and the legal elements of

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,830
attribution so I'm very much looking

61
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,709
forward to their presentations we'll

62
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,690
begin with MS Lee's vakul Lee's is the

63
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,420
chief executive officer at cyber law

64
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,370
international she's also a member of the

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,458
Estonian delegation to the United

66
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,280
Nations group of government experts and

67
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:54,109
finally she is an ambassador and an

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,000
alumna of the CCDC OE itself and Li's of

69
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,549
course was managing editor of the

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,859
Tallinn manual 2.0 on international law

71
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,700
applicable to cyber operations Li's the

72
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,910
floor is all yours

73
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,129
Thank You Sean ladies and gentlemen good

74
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,160
afternoon welcome to this session and

75
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,709
attribution indeed as someone who spent

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,500
several years working at the CCD theory

77
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:19,220
it's always a distinct pleasure to come

78
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,310
back to saikhan to come back to an event

79
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,459
that really feels like home today what

80
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,290
I'm going to talk about is how

81
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:31,370
international law standards governing

82
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:33,709
the issue of attribution how they apply

83
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,319
in the cyber context and then secondly

84
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,959
if into what extent the international

85
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,018
law standards affect the policy

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,290
attribution of malicious cyber activity

87
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,950
so without further ado I'll just get

88
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,250
straight to the topic first of all to

89
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,399
understand how law of X policy I should

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,129
briefly tell you about how international

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,220
law regulates the issue of attribution

92
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:04,790
and in law attribution is actually a

93
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,859
two-step process the first step involves

94
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,870
identifying what the legal standards for

95
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,730
attribution are and there are several

96
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,579
and international law I'll briefly go

97
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,039
over those and then the second step in

98
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,918
the international law of attribution is

99
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,500
to apply the law to the facts in other

100
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,469
words it's the evidentiary question

101
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,170
with regard to the first step like I

102
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,290
mentioned there are several bases for

103
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,980
regarding acts of certain entities as

104
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,500
those of states under international law

105
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,720
the ground rule the most common the most

106
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,700
uncontroversial rule is that when we

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,180
have what are called organs of states

108
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,780
acting then their actions their cyber

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,450
activities are attributable to a state

110
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,030
what are organs organs are entities that

111
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,849
make up the governmental structure of a

112
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,950
state so if you wear a uniform you're an

113
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,720
organ of a state when you engage in

114
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,909
malicious cyber activity that violates

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
international law your state has

116
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,560
violated international law if you work

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,030
for the Minister of Defense if you work

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,430
for the Minister of Foreign Affairs

119
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,820
you work for a cyber center of

120
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,430
excellence or a national cert then your

121
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,840
actions qualify as actions of an organ

122
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,540
of a state therefore they're

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,239
attributable and if you through your

124
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,800
actions engage in some sort of conduct

125
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,530
that is in breach of international legal

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,470
obligations then your country has

127
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,039
violated international law the other

128
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,480
test has got somewhat of a clumsy

129
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,580
articulation it has to do with entities

130
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,770
that are empowered by law to exercise

131
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,390
elements of governmental authority the

132
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,020
first two tests are based on an

133
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,120
institutional link and the second one

134
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,310
the entities empowered by law these have

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,940
to do with certain parastatal entities

136
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:55,250
that engage in governmental functions in

137
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,979
the non cyber context we will talk about

138
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,040
private military companies in the cyber

139
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:04,039
context for example the cyber security

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,830
firm that does intelligence for a state

141
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,710
and as you know some cyber security

142
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,020
companies have a very close relationship

143
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,630
with a particular government they do

144
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,479
intelligence for the state employees

145
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,270
hold high-level security clearances so

146
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,550
in such a situation we might have an

147
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,049
entity that is empowered by law even

148
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,160
though actually it's a private company

149
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,080
to carry out governmental governmental

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,110
functions and therefore that entity's

151
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,030
actions are attributable if the entity

152
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,620
the cyber security firm Inc

153
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,859
is an intelligence collection and

154
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,080
excessively infringes upon the privacy

155
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,810
of individuals it is actually the state

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,620
that has violated international law and

157
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,320
then finally the third third common

158
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,810
basis for attribution has to do with a

159
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,330
factual link between a state and a

160
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,880
non-state actor and the rule goes as

161
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,940
follows if you're a state and you're

162
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,280
instructing directing or controlling a

163
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,920
non-state actor to engage in malicious

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,559
cyber activity then that actors

165
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,030
activities are attributable to you so

166
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,190
that's the law in a nutshell very

167
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,679
simplified but these are the key legal

168
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,140
bases for attribution in international

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,840
law now the second question really has

170
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,060
to do with applying the law to the facts

171
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,969
like I mentioned and this is especially

172
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,910
relevant in the cyber context because as

173
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,910
you will know States very rarely will

174
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,800
have absolute certainty that indeed an

175
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,020
organ of a state was behind a malicious

176
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,660
cyber activity or that a state indeed

177
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,180
was instructing a private company to

178
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,580
engage in malicious cyber activity so

179
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,730
the legal question for us is how much

180
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,219
evidence is enough evidence what does

181
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:53,270
the law say about that how well do the

182
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,160
facts need to be established and here it

183
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,560
is important to distinguish between

184
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,770
different purposes of attribution

185
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,770
because the rules are somewhat different

186
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:06,590
one purpose of attribution are to be an

187
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,780
emerging practice of attribution is to

188
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,690
name and shame other States for having

189
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,349
engaged in cyber operations that violate

190
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,080
international law to my knowledge only

191
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:21,410
one state has done so it was the United

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,510
Kingdom in October last year when they

193
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,960
attributed several cyber operations to

194
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:29,090
the Russian GRU and there the UK

195
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,190
national cyber security center said that

196
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,010
those operations without specifying

197
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:37,400
which ones constitute a flagrant

198
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,289
violation of international law to my

199
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,390
knowledge this is the only example of a

200
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,370
state naming and shaming another country

201
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,390
for having violated international law

202
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,329
how much proof does the country accusing

203
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,860
the other state

204
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,589
in violating international law you need

205
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,449
to have what the answer is

206
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,689
the state as a strict matter of law

207
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:58,738
doesn't need to have any proof

208
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:01,019
international it doesn't prohibit lying

209
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:04,410
so the state may even be making up this

210
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,110
claim without it being a violation of

211
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,118
international law for rule of law

212
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,879
countries of course this is something

213
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,920
that I personally would not anticipate I

214
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,199
would not anticipate them going out with

215
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,040
those fake statements and this was also

216
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:22,920
confirmed last April by the ambassador

217
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,839
for cyber affairs of Australia he said

218
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,670
that we wouldn't be saying these things

219
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,009
in the international environment just

220
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,809
for the fun of it it's the fact that we

221
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,839
have evidence to prove that this

222
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:35,249
activity is attributed to you to you so

223
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
this is the practice of states but

224
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:40,860
international law doesn't require States

225
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,230
to have any level of confidence in the

226
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,170
facts for the for the simple purpose of

227
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,059
naming and shaming the situation is

228
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,679
somewhat different when it comes to what

229
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,199
are known as measures of unilateral

230
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,299
self-help and those of you who were in

231
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:57,449
the deterrence panel you heard some of

232
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,769
them being mentioned for example the

233
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,199
inherent right of states to engage in

234
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,600
self defense is a measure of self-help

235
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:05,309
the right to engage in countermeasures

236
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,540
or the right to respond to cyber

237
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,699
operations based upon the clear

238
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,809
necessity these are measures of

239
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:16,319
self-help and with regard to the

240
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:20,809
exercise of self-help international law

241
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:23,699
is perhaps even surprisingly

242
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:27,269
accommodating of the concern that states

243
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:30,899
will not have 100 percent certainty when

244
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:33,029
it comes to the attribution issue for

245
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,549
the right of self-defense for example

246
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,339
most international law scholars would

247
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:40,529
say well the standard is we ask what

248
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,839
would a reasonable state in the same or

249
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,999
similar circumstances conclude about the

250
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,860
author of the operation what would a

251
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:49,980
reasonable state conclude about

252
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,779
attribution and if it is reasonable for

253
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,480
a state that is suffering from a cyber

254
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,639
armed attack and you should know that

255
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,139
this is a very high threshold if the

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,449
state is faced with such a national

257
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,000
security threat does the state need to

258
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,029
have out

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,519
certainty with regard to the attribution

260
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,310
issue answer is no we asked what is it

261
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,689
reasonable for the state to conclude as

262
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:16,449
to the author of the operation the rules

263
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:19,930
are yet different for judicial

264
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:22,149
proceedings we haven't seen it yet but

265
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,878
I'm certain somewhere down the road this

266
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,160
is going to happen we're a cyber dispute

267
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,910
will appear before an international

268
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,860
court or tribunal the International

269
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,969
Court of Justice for example if the ICJ

270
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,709
were to hear a cyber dispute the court

271
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,170
would apply its own standard of proof

272
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,268
for the ICJ it's going to be somewhere

273
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,399
between beyond a reasonable doubt and

274
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,939
clear and convincing evidence somewhere

275
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:52,389
along this spectrum for an International

276
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:54,370
Criminal Court in a criminal tribunal

277
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,069
the standard will be beyond a reasonable

278
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,860
doubt so the standards will vary

279
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:03,040
depending on the court or tribunal that

280
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,620
we're talking about and then finally

281
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,540
since most disputes between states are

282
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,689
settled outside of court they're settled

283
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,149
in negotiations then if States were to

284
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:16,449
sit down at a table and negotiate a

285
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,250
cyber dispute the standard of proof that

286
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,979
will apply will be whatever the the

287
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,139
parties to the dispute to decide it may

288
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,800
be the preponderance of evidence facts

289
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,059
are more likely this than not so really

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,910
the standard of evidence in

291
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,740
international law will depend on what

292
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,529
kind of attribution are we talking about

293
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,040
what is the purpose of the attribution

294
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:42,129
so this is international law

295
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,300
what does policy say what are we seeing

296
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:48,370
States do with regard to policy

297
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,559
attribution I've arbitrarily picked

298
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,689
three statements where states have

299
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,000
accused other states of having engaged

300
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,519
in malicious cyber activity and

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,529
statements that also articulate the

302
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,339
level of confidence of the accusing

303
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:05,050
state and you'll see that in 2016 the US

304
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,550
government for examples that the

305
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,609
intelligence community said that they

306
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,410
were confident that it was Russia who

307
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,199
interfered

308
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,809
in the Democratic National Committee's

309
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:19,868
communications and released them the UK

310
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:23,049
is the national cybersecurity center two

311
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:25,989
years ago in December 2017 said it was

312
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:28,869
highly likely that one a cry was

313
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:32,349
attributable to North Korea and the same

314
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:34,779
Center in the UK said that the GRU was

315
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:36,759
almost certainly responsible for the

316
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,519
various cyber operations that were

317
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,409
attributed to the GRU and the national

318
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,129
cybersecurity center made that

319
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:47,829
assessment with high confidence finally

320
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,609
you'll see that in the US the Office of

321
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,559
the Director of National Intelligence

322
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:55,209
has put out guidance on what certain

323
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,009
confidence levels mean and you'll see

324
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,829
that high confidence really is a very

325
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:03,129
high confidence level indeed high

326
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:06,069
confidence for the odni is proof beyond

327
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:08,679
a reasonable doubt without a reasonable

328
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:12,669
alternative that's a very high standard

329
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:15,009
and moderate confidence is also to my

330
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:18,039
eyes a very high standard clear and

331
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:21,220
convincing with no circumstantial cases

332
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:23,799
for alternatives so these are very very

333
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,850
high standards the point that I'm trying

334
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,339
to get to is that policy experts are

335
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,589
often very careful to emphasize that

336
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,139
political attribution statements like

337
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,329
these are solely political

338
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:40,899
determinations and law doesn't play much

339
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:43,449
of a role in those determinations it is

340
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,949
true unless we're talking about a state

341
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,738
accusing another state of having

342
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:50,889
violated international law but as you'll

343
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:53,199
see as you just seen States even for

344
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:56,109
political attribution require a very

345
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,449
high level of confidence in the facts

346
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:00,369
they as a matter of political practice

347
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,079
employ a very high standard of proof

348
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:04,029
before they go out and accuse another

349
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,669
state of having to engage the malicious

350
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:09,669
cyber activity so perhaps the concern

351
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:11,739
about mixing law and policy at least

352
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:15,160
when it comes to public attributions is

353
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:17,779
a bit overstated

354
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,079
now when states attribute cyber

355
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,699
activities in the policy sense they

356
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,589
don't just say a state did it but they

357
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:27,469
also make sure to condemn the cyber

358
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:31,430
activity here again I have three

359
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,709
arbitrary examples from last year three

360
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,989
different countries accusing other

361
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:39,079
states of having engaged in a bad

362
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,779
behavior in cyberspace and what is

363
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,269
interesting here is the language that

364
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:46,639
they employ when you take a careful look

365
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:50,839
at those statements can you see that the

366
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:54,410
wording is very very careful it's very

367
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,259
laid back it's not categorical Estonians

368
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,089
saying that Russia is called on tact

369
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,149
responsibly and in accordance with

370
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,529
international law Australia says that

371
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,269
Russia is acting contrary to the

372
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,180
consensus and international law and

373
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:11,839
norms the Netherlands the GRU was

374
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:16,519
undermining international law so these

375
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,310
are very opaque very vague statements

376
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,410
they're not horribly specific so the

377
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,420
question that I ask is why are we not

378
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,329
seeing States come out with more

379
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,000
concrete accusations why are they not

380
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,130
saying that country acts violated

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,230
international law in particular rule

382
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,300
acts as well as three rules on this

383
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,759
responsible state behavior which are the

384
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,079
following so why are we not seeing

385
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,910
States do that probably one of the

386
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,189
reasons is that US states apply

387
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,689
international law and norms of

388
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,759
responsible state behavior in this

389
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,500
domain they are acutely aware of the

390
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,399
fact that they are engaged in a

391
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,279
balancing act and this means that as

392
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,779
rule of law countries are investing

393
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,959
heavily into cyber capability

394
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,819
development they are cognizant that once

395
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,948
they start drawing the lines in the sand

396
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,089
they are not only creating rules for

397
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,390
other countries but they're also

398
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,039
creating rules for themselves and

399
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,970
they're careful not to prematurely tie

400
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:21,079
their own hands also rule of law

401
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,299
countries I suspect are take account

402
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,970
take into account the fact that when

403
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,010
they draw those clearer lines

404
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,720
then their adversaries are not

405
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,059
necessarily rule of law countries

406
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,740
so in effect countries are creating

407
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,700
rules for themselves that their

408
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,150
adversaries are unlikely to follow I

409
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,909
personally find this a troubling

410
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,070
consideration why especially in today's

411
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:50,059
international security environment which

412
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:54,289
is which is very flammable which is very

413
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:57,379
worrisome I think States should not walk

414
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:59,690
back on the norms a normative order but

415
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,210
rather enforce the normative order

416
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,690
insist on a rule space the cyberspace

417
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:12,710
rather than leave it as vague as gray as

418
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:15,830
open to action as possible and and this

419
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,140
inevitably raises the question well okay

420
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,000
we may have rules but how do you ensure

421
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,010
compliance with those rules how do you

422
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,530
ensure that both rules a responsible

423
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,450
state behavior as well as international

424
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,370
law really make a difference that it's

425
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,500
not just that good countries if you will

426
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,570
that abide by the rules but that all

427
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,350
actors who are active in this domain

428
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,799
abide by those rules now the first

429
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,379
comment that I would make here is that

430
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,559
rules as a general matter they're meant

431
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,900
to provide guidance for States at Fonte

432
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,330
if you again were in the deterrence

433
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,950
panel you heard Jay Healy say that the

434
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,340
way rules are being worked out at the

435
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,039
moment is on the go on the battlefield

436
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,770
in action states poking elbows at each

437
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,129
other rather than externally determining

438
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:07,100
what is acceptable behavior and what is

439
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,500
unacceptable this goes against the logic

440
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,049
of norms of having norms of having laws

441
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,539
which prescribe in advance which

442
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:16,940
behavior is acceptable tolerated and

443
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:19,580
which is prohibited thereby putting

444
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,850
actors on notice what kind of behavior

445
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,428
is expected of them the related issue of

446
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,730
course is that of enforcement which is a

447
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,080
whole can of worms in and of itself but

448
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,480
we probably cannot talk about

449
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,059
enforcement unless we have articulated

450
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,130
at least some rules because how do we

451
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,149
enforce rules if you don't know what the

452
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,010
rules

453
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:45,040
enforcement again there are several

454
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,410
several ways of enforcing rules

455
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,560
some of them come from international law

456
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,690
itself self-help measures are a tool for

457
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,000
enforcing international law judicial

458
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,010
process is a form of enforcing

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,650
international law but other

460
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,000
extrajudicial extra legal measures of

461
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,770
course are available to enforce

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,440
international law as well be they

463
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:09,310
economic diplomatic military you name it

464
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,280
and then final point because this is a

465
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,409
panel on attribution what about all

466
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,930
those states that do not have the

467
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,720
capacity to attribute to that do not

468
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,190
have powerful allies with whom to do

469
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,490
joint attribution

470
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,870
what are they left with and the answer

471
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:33,580
at least import lies in a notion that is

472
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:35,770
known commonly as due diligence and the

473
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,370
due diligence the notion says that

474
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,290
states masters should take reasonably

475
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,979
feasible action to ensure that their

476
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:47,560
state is not used by by third parties to

477
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,080
the detriment of other states now due

478
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,750
diligence unfortunately has proven to be

479
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,850
an controversial issue in international

480
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,650
relations if you ask almost any

481
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,990
international lawyer they will say that

482
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,450
due diligence is a rule of international

483
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,300
law in other words states not only

484
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,330
should do so but states must ensure that

485
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,760
their territory is not used in such a

486
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,980
way and there are several countries that

487
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,010
say yes this is international law

488
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,980
including Gastonia in this morning's

489
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:20,620
speech however it's it's mostly bigger

490
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,910
more powerful countries that reject due

491
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:26,560
diligence as binding international law

492
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,350
we can speculate why different countries

493
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,649
we check this and to an extent they

494
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,709
probably have different rationales but

495
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,370
as a generalization I feel that bigger

496
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,960
countries are much more willing to

497
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,840
ascertain rights under international law

498
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,730
rather than than they are willing to

499
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,418
self impose international legal

500
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:51,469
obligations on them

501
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:53,479
but if due-diligence was treated as law

502
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,799
it's man it would mean for those

503
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:58,369
countries that do not have the capacity

504
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:02,929
to attribute that what they need to do

505
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:04,968
is to find is to only trace back the

506
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,129
cyber operation to the territorial state

507
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:09,379
where it is coming from it doesn't need

508
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:11,779
to prove an axis between the territory

509
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:14,329
and that territorial government or a

510
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,219
third government all that the state

511
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:18,469
needs to do is say it comes from your

512
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:20,929
territory it's causing serious harm to

513
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:22,549
me and you have a legal obligation to do

514
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:27,469
everything that you reasonably can to

515
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:35,719
put an end to it so with that I thank

516
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:37,639
you so as a matter of how we'll proceed

517
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:40,279
let's hold the questions till the end

518
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,039
but as the moderator I reserve the

519
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,409
prerogative to ask questions now le's

520
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,809
while the others are presenting I wonder

521
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,389
if you could consider this attribution

522
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:52,070
or the attribution game no longer seems

523
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:54,619
to be the exclusive prerogative of

524
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,509
states we've highly capable and well

525
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:58,849
resourced actors I'm thinking of

526
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,979
CrowdStrike and mandiant making very

527
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:04,939
public attributions at least in a

528
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:07,339
technical sense do these frustrate the

529
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,139
delicate balance you referred to that

530
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:11,450
states are engaged in their in their own

531
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:13,958
attribution efforts are they forcing

532
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,940
States hands are they doing attribution

533
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:19,279
differently than states are in a way

534
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,629
that frustrates their efforts perhaps

535
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,609
you'd be willing to think on that and

536
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:25,218
we'll come back to you after the other

537
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:27,619
presenters okay our final presenter then

538

Thank You Sean for that very kind

553
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,269
introduction

554
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:13,190
like to also thank the organizers for

555
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:15,380
another great event I remember last year

556
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,690
around the time of saikhan there was an

557
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,210
Iron Maiden concert here pretty cool

558
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,340
this year I get off the plane and the

559
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,139
taxi driver says Metallica is coming in

560
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,149
the next week or two and I just thought

561
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:28,209
even the concerts are getting better and

562
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:35,629
better here now the cadets are is said

563
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:39,470
sir what is a Metallica and I only the

564
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:43,250
best band ever but I do want to welcome

565
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,840
our cadets and Midshipmen too we

566
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,929
actually have a second lieutenant here

567
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,309
who just graduated on Saturday she

568
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:51,769
actually gave up her leave Jenny

569
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:55,070
congratulations on that graduate in West

570
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:57,380
Point gave up her leave and vacation to

571
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,590
come here the next day on a plane and

572
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,149
that just shows a level of our

573
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,529
determination our young officers have

574
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,580
and that sort of thing and we'll talk a

575
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,260
little bit later about her

576
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:10,730
decision-making as far as giving up free

577
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:14,299
leave but and I don't remember as a

578
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,220
cadet having these opportunities to come

579
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:19,039
to saikhan or Estonia but I'm very glad

580
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,779
that you have them I don't even remember

581
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,429
getting outside of the gate to Highland

582
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:26,000
Falls which is a town outside of West

583
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:27,649
Point but want to thank the leadership

584
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,690
of the ACI the army cyber Institute

585
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:31,639
chris hartley and andy hall for

586
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:37,610
continuing to support the cadets coming

587
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:40,459
here and Paul Torres crew the mids uh it

588
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,889
is of course a disclaimer is necessary

589
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,929
for someone in the Department of Defense

590
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:47,149
the u.s. I'm here my personal capacity

591
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,070
not speaking for the United States

592
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:51,860
government the United States Army West

593
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,889
Point or anything like that it's I'm

594
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,959
here in my personal capacity my fellow

595
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,750
panelists have done a great job and I

596
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,889
certainly agree with everything these

597
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,500
and Menaul have had to say but if we all

598
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:11,000
say the same or agree on everything that

599
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,960
would be boring so I'm gonna maybe be a

600
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,080
little provocative here

601
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,520
what I'd like to suggest is maybe an

602
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,220
observation that certain states are

603
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,160
perfectly happy having cyberattacks

604
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,750
attributed to them or at least they

605
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,730
don't seem to mind having them

606
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,390
attributed to him I just have a couple

607
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,830
slides here to help frame the discussion

608
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,470
you've heard the legal aspects of

609
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:41,240
attribution as I think about the issue

610
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,830
though it's occurred to me recently that

611
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,100
we may want to look at attribution

612
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:50,460
through a different framework you hear

613
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,659
about all the incidents we don't have to

614
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,570
get into all of them necessarily but we

615
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,040
certainly can you you hear a lot of

616
00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:00,330
association with states

617
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:04,250
you don't hear great worldwide response

618
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:07,740
you hear some denials certainly I agree

619
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:11,040
but you don't hear it as much in as my

620
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:14,250
thought that maybe certain states don't

621
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,850
mind being labeled perpetrators in this

622
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,870
regard

623
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:21,480
the current framework is victim focused

624
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,520
the typical question being is a victim

625
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,010
state willing to publicly attribute the

626
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,580
attack to another state as you've heard

627
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,920
sometimes that is a question and also

628
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,480
assumes that the perpetrator I think as

629
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,970
a town man you said purportedly

630
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,590
responsible state wants to avoid

631
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,560
attribution and I would like to change

632
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:46,050
that to suggest I don't think that view

633
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,960
is wrong but I would like to add an

634
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:51,270
inquiry of basically looking at the

635
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
perpetrators motivations in addition to

636
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:56,780
the victim and whether or not the victim

637
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,550
state is willing or able to attribute

638
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,620
certainly the examples are many and

639
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,600
Lee's went through a lot of those and we

640
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,489
know the states that are generally

641
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,120
associated with them not pecho want to

642
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:13,200
cry ENC financial institutions

643
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,419
intellectual property theft even Stuxnet

644
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,840
we're not always talking about quote

645
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:21,630
unquote bad actors that want to avoid

646
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,490
attribution it can be for a variety of

647
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,250
reasons that we'll get into both policy

648
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,500
and legal

649
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,390
a minute and this is all open source of

650
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,070
course none of this is based on any

651
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:35,660
classified knowledge this is this is

652
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:39,560
just very public reports and you've

653
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:42,230
heard from these now the most important

654
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,570
part is to what I think do not assume

655
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:48,530
the perpetrator wants to avoid

656
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:50,659
attribution oftentimes we we think

657
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,879
that's the case and the questions to ask

658
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:57,710
which the answers to which may inform

659
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:01,190
this approach I would offer a few what

660
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,880
explains a lapse in tradecraft you see

661
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:07,940
sloppiness you see language time zone

662
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,930
indicators of certain attacks that are

663
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,190
they're quite clear was that intentional

664
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,840
or is it just simply a lapse in

665
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,870
tradecraft I certainly leave that to the

666
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,610
technical folks but it is it does occur

667
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,679
to me that that's a bit of sloppiness

668
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:28,100
and a surprise why are the denials

669
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,770
unconvincing and or non-existence states

670
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,020
do deny as I've said but the silence can

671
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:36,290
be deafening sometimes and it feels like

672
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:40,129
they're okay in some cases with being

673
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:42,080
attributed to them and I say also what

674
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,890
is the most obvious explanation

675
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,169
the Occam's razor of international law I

676
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:51,710
would say I applied to international law

677
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:55,340
the most obvious explanation may be the

678
00:29:51,710 --> 00:30:00,370
most likely for who conducted the

679
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,370
operation if you look at Sony Pictures

680
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,280
my 11 year old daughter could probably

681
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,040
figure out there's a movie about a

682
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,530
dictator who might want to respond to

683
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,330
that notice I did not see my 13 year old

684
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,820
son I'm not sure he would get I think he

685
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,490
would I think you figure it out but that

686
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:21,189
one is sort of obvious so then the

687
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:25,490
question becomes why why would anyone

688
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:29,720
tacitly maybe not overtly as a state

689
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:32,780
accept attribution I offer several

690
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,580
possibilities again this is this is just

691
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,510
a way of thinking about it and what I'm

692
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,510
considering here

693
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,830
first that the state is seeking

694
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,290
attention right we have we have clearly

695
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,059
a statecraft argument that certain

696
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,178
states want to increase their world

697
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:52,940
standing we can think of those even with

698
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:56,330
some human rights issues and that they

699
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,000
may want to hide that or to embellish

700
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,000
their standing in the world by having

701
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,500
this capability in the cyber realm as a

702
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,770
great scholar and friend recently

703
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,200
reminded me from dr. Strangelove I think

704
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,809
Peter Sellers said the whole point of

705
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,830
having a doomsday machine is loss if you

706
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:18,160
keep it a secret and so kind of like

707
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,070
celebrities in the US and other places

708
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,140
no press is bad press for some of these

709
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,990
countries or states and international

710
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,460
law and they're perfectly fine with

711
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,750
having things associate with them or

712
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,410
being in the news for something other

713
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:36,080
than failures at the political economic

714
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:38,809
level or even just not being at the same

715
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,770
level as other states classic asymmetric

716
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:45,410
warfare right if you can't fight on the

717
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:48,350
same battlefield maybe go go asymmetric

718
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,900
go hybrid go unconventional and have

719
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,000
that sort of leverage and that sort of

720
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,790
power and we see that it may be working

721
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the US Department of Defense Cyber

722
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:02,178
strategy just this past year came out

723
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,940
names for countries so we're not

724
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:08,510
surprised China Iran North Korea and

725
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,970
Russia and so even the naming of them as

726
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,720
an adversary and a worthy adversary in

727
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:18,620
the cyber realm raises their stature

728
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,530
certainly in some way I would also argue

729
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,969
that states seek to illustrate their own

730
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,470
capabilities while demonstrating a

731
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,030
victim states vulnerabilities this is

732
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,780
kind of a deterrence flipped around

733
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,860
right if you want to go specific they

734
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,660
will want to show the country that they

735
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,340
may be attacking or tacitly

736
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,650
acknowledging a cyber attack having been

737
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,879
attributed to them in a way of saying

738
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,710
don't do this again

739
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,090
generally showing the power of the world

740
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,160
if we want to talk general deterrence

741
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,580
but again flipping that from the victims

742
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:53,250
perspective to the attackers perspective

743
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,080
and in a way of preventing others with

744
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,330
messing with them if they don't have

745
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,480
power in other areas it may be as simple

746
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:05,550
as leadership seeking domestic favor to

747
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,500
show their own state that they have

748
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,730
power and strength that we could think

749
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,940
of some countries that might be

750
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,620
interested in that and just as a way of

751
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,770
showing their own population that they

752
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,750
are still relevant or it may be simply

753
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:22,139
that the costs are just not high enough

754
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,620
at least technically they may be I'm not

755
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,150
a technical expert in any way but at

756
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,239
least in terms of policy in law

757
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,950
maybe we can suggest that there's not

758
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,290
enough punishment to deter them this

759
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,180
simply the costs are not high enough so

760
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,510
they don't mind having attacks

761
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,420
attributed to them simply put certain

762
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,700
states benefit from having cyber attacks

763
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,330
attributed to them regardless of where

764
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,330
we draw the line

765
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,600
now once properly framed I think we can

766
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:59,570
ask the same question from a legal

767
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,928
perspective if you're the perpetrator

768
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,480
why tacitly accept attribution from a

769
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:08,659
legal perspective and I have just a few

770
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,190
thoughts on that and the first may be

771
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,520
that the state does not believe it is

772
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,770
committing a wrongful act you see is

773
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,859
again relatively underwhelming efforts

774
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,569
to hide identity even you could think

775
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:23,839
about states commonly linked to to

776
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:25,579
Stuxnet maybe suggests some belief that

777
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,429
the state is not committing a wrongful

778
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:30,619
act legally which leads into other

779
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:35,389
debates for which we don't have time but

780
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:37,190
its sovereignty comes to mind where the

781
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,220
action may be justified if it's for

782
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,490
example to thwart a nuclear capability

783
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:45,678
again I'm not suggesting this is all my

784
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:46,939
thoughts I'm not aware of anything in

785
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,240
particular where this is a case but I

786
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:54,168
just it makes sense to me or the UK view

787
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:56,719
in such areas as we see now about

788
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:58,368
sovereignty being maybe being a little

789
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,649
bit more of a guiding principle than an

790
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:04,579
inviolable rule according you know in

791
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,710
accordance with the UN Charter but again

792
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:08,900
flipping the the view and notice we do

793
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,970
not say just bad actors are willing to

794
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,720
have attacks attributed to them it could

795
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:18,230
be quote unquote good actors it's just

796
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,520
the idea that they might accept it it

797
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,980
could also be that the state is trying

798
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,130
to influence state practice or move the

799
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:29,060
needle on lawfulness I think this is not

800
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:31,480
likely but we want this as something

801
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,630
states think about before acting right

802
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,250
certainly as lawyers we would want that

803
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,630
but I'm not sure they do as you know

804
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,500
state practice can lead to the

805
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,310
development of customary international

806
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:46,250
law and it may be some attempt to nudge

807
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:49,578
that forward as a demonstration of state

808
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,950
practice but I don't know that that one

809
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:54,589
is is the case it could be that the

810
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,029
state is attempting to exploit a gray or

811
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:59,509
gray zone of international law you've

812
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:02,050
heard this point before again a type of

813
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,250
asymmetric warfare is it not

814
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,869
we're States committed to rule of law

815
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,400
less likely operating the grades on the

816
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:09,800
states that do not share a rule of law

817
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,760
commitment as these mentioned I think

818
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,260
very nicely state seek to exploit

819
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,819
international law rules that are poorly

820
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,690
delineated attribution may be the same

821
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:22,190
opening and possibility what is

822
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,430
direction mean what is control what are

823
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:28,430
instructions as Lee's laid out the law

824
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,310
and the legal ambiguity hobbles a

825
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:36,290
response as many great scholars have

826
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:38,930
written but make it no mistake when an

827
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:43,520
attack is minimally destructive but

828
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:45,379
maxim maximally disruptive it still can

829
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,410
be below the threshold of wrongfulness

830
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:53,980
legally and that can get into the grey

831
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:57,319
zone piece of course it could be

832
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:00,200
anything else we don't know we maybe

833
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:05,119
think about some of those possibilities

834
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:08,509
during QA or after and I would just

835
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:13,160
offer we never know what estates

836
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,750
intentions are obviously but knowing or

837
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,970
thinking about things at least

838
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:23,770
differently can help us close legal gaps

839
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,770
so there is a legal connection here

840
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:30,799
every situation is different here come

841
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,220
my caveats every situation is different

842
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,550
I realize that we'll never know what the

843
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,589
true intentions of a state are and my

844
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:44,599
way is just another consideration in a

845
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:47,960
difficult area and with those caveat

846
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:51,109
said I am more than willing to be pinned

847
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,730
down and recorded as saying certain

848
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:57,190
states may be happy in certain

849
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:01,900
situations to have certain things

850
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,900
attributed to them thank you

851
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,170
thank you rob

852
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,089
and I'm sure Metallica would endorse

853
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,670
your your swimming upstream you're

854
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:18,109
you're running against the current yeah

855
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,730
this is flies kind of in the face of the

856
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,470
whole title of the conference right it's

857
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,260
silent battle and here comes Rob so I'm

858
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:27,098
with maybe not so silent you know some

859
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,980
of what you describe Rob reminded me of

860
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:32,660
of herb Lynn's work on loud cyber

861
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,950
operations I think from the technical

862
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,960
community and from the policy community

863
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,779
some of what you've explored has been

864
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,550
has been addressed but not in the way

865
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,900
you did particularly can you distinguish

866
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,520
some of his work I think some of the

867
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,440
room may be familiar with his work on

868
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,910
loud cyber operations is there a

869
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,920
distinction or a difference between what

870
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,920
you are describing and what and herbs

871
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,420
work there so stew on that you've got

872
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,319
the shortest time to work with I know I

873
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,839
know that

874
00:38:54,319 --> 00:39:00,109
so Lee's now to you on the question that

875
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:03,020
I posed to you these private efforts so

876
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:05,810
Mandy a CrowdStrike friend or foe to the

877
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,579
really nuanced or or subtle approaches

878
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,869
that states are taking to political

879
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:15,050
attribution it's probably both there are

880
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,849
some aspects of non-state actor

881
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,300
attribution that I'm sure frustrate

882
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:22,700
State mean States may feel compelled to

883
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,640
respond when a non-state actor when a

884
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:29,270
private firm has attributed malicious

885
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,970
are activated to a state there may be a

886
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,819
reputation or concerns States may feel

887
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:38,660
that they're out performed by a private

888
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:40,759
company and not like that horribly but

889
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,129
on the other hand and there are Studies

890
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,630
on this as well the private sector

891
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,819
attribution can be very helpful for

892
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,640
states can help them bypass the

893
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:54,579
classification dilemma they don't

894
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,750
necessarily need to come up with as much

895
00:39:54,579 --> 00:40:01,280
previously classified information as

896
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:03,740
they perhaps otherwise word and some

897
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,030
companies surely have access to some

898
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,299
type of information that the state

899
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,630
itself does not have fireEye has got

900
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,920
sensors all over the world where states

901
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,530
typically tend to have their sensors

902
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,680
rather in their own territory than all

903
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,109
over the world

904
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,328
so from a policy perspective and I'm

905
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:23,848
sure policy experts are much more

906
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:26,130
qualified to opine on this I think there

907
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,510
are pros and cons but as a matter of law

908
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,020
I don't think that private sector

909
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:33,170
tribution frustrates the law at all

910
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:37,609
international law has dealt with

911
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:40,650
non-public private sources of evidences

912
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:43,680
since the very beginning international

913
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:50,160
courts they accept witness testimony is

914
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:52,529
to accept expert expert testimony so I

915
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,410
don't think that's a problem per se for

916
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:59,160
international law at least thanks Li's

917
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:01,200
no yes so your question was the

918
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,020
interaction between the highly

919
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,118
coordinated and delicate feeling very

920
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,730
diplomatic feeling process you described

921
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,569
it the EU and then some emerging

922
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,440
proposals in some sense to outsource

923
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:17,058
attribution to make it a private effort

924
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,430
even adjudicate adjudicative functions

925
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:24,180
feasible to have state buy-in to these

926
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:28,259
processes and second if yes with what

927
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,868
conditions are what provisos I would

928
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,970
also like to pick up on Lisa's answer

929
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:35,010
and I think we'll roll into only one

930
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,279
question I would say twisdon second one

931
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:41,880
doesn't count

932
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:43,260
so indeed I think it's it's it's very

933
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,210
useful and I think the private sector

934
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,190
has a lot of information that can be

935
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,410
used for attribution in particular for

936
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,260
instance when it comes to to imposing

937
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,328
sanctions as that must be based at open

938
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,789
source information and indeed you can

939
00:41:54,329 --> 00:42:01,319
you know divert from the classification

940
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:03,510
project problem etc you also see the

941
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:06,000
cooperation between states and private

942
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,980
sectors when it comes to sharing of

943
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,559
information I mean there's a lot of

944
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,099
private public cooperation when it comes

945
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,230
to certs

946
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:17,460
but also for instance Europe also law

947
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:19,140
enforcement so you see this this is very

948
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,220
successful cooperation taking place

949
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:27,170
where it becomes problematic when

950
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:29,750
private companies want to take over the

951
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:33,110
responsibility of states when it comes

952
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:36,410
to international law or when it comes to

953
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:41,390
international relations and in that

954
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:45,160
sense initiatives of either private

955
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:50,000
companies proposing that we should

956
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:54,440
negotiate a treaty estates cyber Geneva

957
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,530
Convention I mean yes indeed or stay a

958
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,180
private company saying that they will

959
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:02,120
establish an attribution Council that

960
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,870
will then give us everything we need to

961
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,009
impose consequences that have

962
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:08,839
significant or could have significant

963
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:13,220
effect on international relations and

964
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,720
even on on peace and stability I think

965
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,629
that's something that is not desirable

966
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,549
states pertain a special responsibility

967
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,110
when it comes to this and it should

968
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,450
remain like this

969
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,850
although the I mean the EU does

970
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,850
recognize the responsibility of all

971
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,620
actors including the private sector and

972
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,480
that could be in need when it comes to

973
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,759
sharing information which touches upon

974
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,160
attribution but also when it comes to

975
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,800
developing secure products and services

976
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,440
so other stakeholders have other

977
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,310
responsibilities these are ours so to

978
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,890
say so therefore that answers the first

979
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,440
question and leaves the second to to the

980
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:55,220
crowd so fair enough so crowdsourcing

981
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,080
the second question here then Rob are

982
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,669
you in her blend seeing eye to eye on

983
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:02,720
this or are you talking about different

984
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:04,430
things I'm familiar dr. Lin's work and I

985
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,029
think it is a little different I

986
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:10,850
distinguish his there's a little louder

987
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:15,770
than what I'm saying like Metallica loud

988
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:17,240
pretty loud okay silent battle you're

989
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,630
gonna have some folks writing on loud

990
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,609
cyber but or we can also see what dr.

991
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:27,650
Lin says after this I think he's

992
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:30,110
knocking them out but he but I think if

993
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,990
I know dr. Lin's work it's more about

994
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:35,390
self attribution from the beginning a

995
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:40,100
state actor could could say right away

996
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:42,290
this is our attack mechanism and self

997
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,490
attribute in that way mine's a little

998
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,840
less visit of all

999
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:47,750
of 10 out of 10 might not be like a

1000
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:51,230
seven or eight all between foot between

1001
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:55,670
there and and the silent battle my

1002
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:59,300
analogy is you know if you get to the

1003
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:01,390
individual person level if someone were

1004
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,430
to be accused of doing something wrong

1005
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:07,580
the loud would be someone saying yes I

1006
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,589
did it and I'll do it again and mine

1007
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:13,150
would be more like maybe I did it maybe

1008
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:16,850
I didn't what are you gonna do about it

1009
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:18,800
but again I those are just some some

1010
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,779
things I like to think of a lot of great

1011
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,020
scholarship in this area even in our

1012
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,210
conference book noticed this yesterday

1013
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,780
there's there's a really neat article on

1014
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:31,280
on loud cyber so again it's a lot of

1015
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,860
folks are thinking about this and I

1016
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,590
would just put mine a nots below that on

1017
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,690
the volume fair enough okay well we have

1018
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,190
time remaining for questions from the

1019
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:43,700
room the protocol I'd like to use is

1020
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:45,950
that the microphones used I'll just call

1021
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:50,359
on folks and the first hand I see is

1022
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:52,040
Kubo go ahead please yeah thanks Shona

1023
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:53,900
oh it's Cubana Chuck University of

1024
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,840
Exeter I have a question for lease and

1025
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,280
for Rob if I may so lease if I

1026
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,460
understood you correctly when you talked

1027
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,500
about unilateral self-help you suggested

1028
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,960
that the standard of proof to use is the

1029
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,300
standard of reasonableness did I get

1030
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,040
that right right okay so I would just

1031
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,230
put it to you that this is maybe the

1032
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,640
wrong lens through which to look at this

1033
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,619
and I wonder what you think about this

1034
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,810
to my mind standard of proof is very

1035
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,970
directly linked to burden of proof and

1036
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,609
so these are concepts that we use in

1037
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:24,770
adjudicatory settings but not in the

1038
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:26,960
situation's of unilateral self-help

1039
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,660
they're the correct lens to my mind is

1040
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,730
simply the allocation of risk so if you

1041
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,129
are acting you're acting you're placing

1042
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,190
the risk upon yourself that you might be

1043
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,390
acting unlawfully and so whereas if you

1044
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,970
look at it from the reasonableness

1045
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,310
perspective then basically what you're

1046
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,379
saying if the state makes a mistake but

1047
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:47,810
it's a mistake that the reasonable state

1048
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,210
would make in those situations it would

1049
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:53,450
still be acting lawfully and so I would

1050
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,350
put it to you that this poses a risk of

1051
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,879
escalation

1052
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,110
especially as countermeasures are

1053
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,060
concerned that it goes

1054
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:01,280
against the Orthodox understanding of

1055
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,290
the law of countermeasures so that's

1056
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,420
that's my question about reasonableness

1057
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,700
and Rob I think the elephant in the room

1058
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,790
here is the geopolitical considerations

1059
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,319
so if we talk about attribution you know

1060
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,330
there are basically three categories of

1061
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,220
countries those that are outside of the

1062
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,810
attribution game then those who

1063
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,939
attribute and those who are attributed

1064
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,470
to and it's something that you didn't

1065
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,840
mention so I just wonder to what extent

1066
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:26,240
these geopolitical considerations play

1067
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,310
into your analysis could those be some

1068
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,950
additional you know reasons why some

1069
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:33,080
states are happy to be attributed not

1070
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:37,549
thanks.thanks good lease you want to

1071
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:39,860
start sure so I think we're actually in

1072
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,990
in agreement and I would interpret the

1073
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,300
law the same way it's true that in the

1074
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,250
context of unilateral self-help that the

1075
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,190
term standard of proof isn't normally

1076
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:51,320
used but I think it's helpful just to

1077
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,150
think through the issue so for the right

1078
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,580
of self-defense the first question would

1079
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,460
be does the state need to have absolute

1080
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,680
certainty as to attribution of the armed

1081
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,550
attack to a state or a non-state actor

1082
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,169
if the state buys and buys into the

1083
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,300
argument that self-defense can be

1084
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,520
exercised against non-state actors so

1085
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,640
does the state need to have 100% proof

1086
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:17,030
before it can resort to self-defense and

1087
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,400
here my answer would be no and I suppose

1088
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,620
you would answer the question in the

1089
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,420
negative as well and then the secondary

1090
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:28,370
question arises what if the state makes

1091
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:30,800
a mistake and and I would say that if

1092
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:33,380
the state makes the mistake then yes the

1093
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,110
state has acted on its own risk so if it

1094
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,120
uses force against an innocent state it

1095
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,580
is not excused in international law so

1096
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,620
it may be obliged to provide reparation

1097
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:45,080
for example but the first question is

1098
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,420
really important do you need 100% proof

1099
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,549
to be able to resort to force in the

1100
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,250
first place because if that was the case

1101
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:54,380
and in almost every circumstance whether

1102
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,480
it's a cyber armed attack or it's mining

1103
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,300
a vessel or the launch of a missile I

1104
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,250
mean in many cases States won't have 100

1105
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,450
percent proof so they would have their

1106
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:07,190
hands tied in the vast majority of cases

1107
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,470
if I may just a brief follow-up so like

1108
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,970
that the point is that before you get to

1109
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,770
a judicial organ the

1110
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,419
the use of the term standard of proof

1111
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:17,060
doesn't help it's neither here nor there

1112
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,500
you need to be before a court and only

1113
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,000
then there is a certain standard of

1114
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,260
proof that's required of course you

1115
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,230
don't need to have a hundred percent

1116
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:26,180
certainty but to say that the standard

1117
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,160
of proof is reasonableness doesn't say

1118
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,680
anything because by that you're just

1119
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,868
saying it's case by case and then we

1120
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,480
will see how things go while still

1121
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,040
risking that a state might say well we

1122
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,599
were acting under the standard of

1123
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,740
reasonableness because everybody would

1124
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,890
have thought the same thing

1125
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:44,689
and thus we didn't act unlawfully but

1126
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,670
what I hear is saying is that we're on

1127
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,440
the same page that the state that makes

1128
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,760
a mistake takes the risk of acting

1129
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,589
unlawfully and it would be acting

1130
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,660
unlawfully so I would just put it to you

1131
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,430
that we should probably leave you know

1132
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,990
the terminology of standard of proof and

1133
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,910
burden of proof or judicial

1134
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,379
determinations and it's not appropriate

1135
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,720
because we don't have an international

1136
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:06,500
law of evidence to use it in these

1137
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,419
bilateral relationships I'm perfectly

1138
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,829
fine to refrain from using the term

1139
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,319
standard proof although the subject

1140
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:14,180
matter is still the same how much

1141
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,740
evidence how well does the state need

1142
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,200
how well do the facts need to be

1143
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:23,839
established for the state to respond

1144
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,649
unilaterally Rob yes Sean good boy I had

1145
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,920
a question for you

1146
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:30,700
yes Cuba I think the first thing I would

1147
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,410
do with any question is absolutely

1148
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:38,930
without doubt consult the cyber law

1149
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:40,460
toolkit but assuming that it's not in

1150
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,828
there because I admit this is not a

1151
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:45,980
tightest legal argument I've ever had

1152
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:47,599
where of a policy I think the categories

1153
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,210
you lay out are exactly right

1154
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,060
I think they reinforce in a way what I'm

1155
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,099
saying states enjoy being in a

1156
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,578
particular category regardless of what

1157
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:00,260
it is and I'm just suggesting they might

1158
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:01,730
double down on that behavior enjoy the

1159
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,520
cachet that that represents whether

1160
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,319
they're always attributed to or part of

1161
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,180
groups that are always attributing or

1162
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,980
may be unwilling to and that they I'm

1163
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:13,759
suggesting that they may enjoy that

1164
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:16,099
category I do think some of written

1165
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:21,130
about you know centralized attribution

1166
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:23,780
body which removes the politics perhaps

1167
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,670
whether it's private or public actor

1168
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,790
as part of that mostly private I think

1169
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,080
we might have and that would remove a

1170
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,630
little bit of politics a willingness to

1171
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:38,660
to attribute as has been suggested or

1172
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:40,700
the ramifications of attributing to

1173
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,950
anyone or having something attributed to

1174
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,839
you so I I certainly agree with you but

1175
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,390
I think there's a lot of possibilities

1176
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,720
here for for scholarship for research

1177
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:51,730
writing and for moving ahead in the

1178
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,259
future

1179
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:57,980
there were and there were two questions

1180
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:01,130
then on this side of the room my name is

1181
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,810
Lisa Post and I'm with a McCain

1182
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:06,220
Institute of international leadership

1183
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:09,320
I'm not a lawyer so I feel the rod

1184
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:12,950
flawed and faulty after the formidable

1185
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:17,300
doctor much I care but my question is

1186
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:19,609
really why would you in terms of what

1187
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,150
attribution gives just in the policy and

1188
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,200
diplomacy world so why would you even

1189
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,120
attribute unless it gives you a

1190
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,779
political advantage in particular in

1191
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,700
terms of deterrence which makes for me

1192
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:36,290
as a practitioner the finer points

1193
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:39,109
almost irrelevant and given that the

1194
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:43,160
economic and diplomatic measures that

1195
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:46,400
we've gotten access to as currently

1196
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,379
responses on the international law don't

1197
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,340
really work anymore naming and shaming

1198
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:55,060
as Robert pointed out doesn't work if

1199
00:52:52,340 --> 00:53:00,830
you get bragging rights out of it

1200
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:02,840
so what attribution Scott getting us in

1201
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:06,970
this current world where our responses

1202
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:11,890
are so limited unless the activity is

1203
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:14,899
above the threshold of an and attack are

1204
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,450
limiting to a point where everyone else

1205
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,270
is learning from the Russian playbook

1206
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:25,009
yes so what would you wish international

1207
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:28,759
law gave you access to or gave nations

1208
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:32,210
access to in terms of responses still in

1209
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,410
peace time so that that tribution would

1210
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,220
be meaningful again

1211
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:40,970
okay so for the panel you know Lisa's

1212
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:44,089
comments seem most directly addressed at

1213
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:47,509
the fit between maybe changing state

1214
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,460
behavior in attribution more public

1215
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:52,880
statements although equivocal as you

1216
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:55,070
pointed out is that change in state

1217
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,020
behavior somehow a comment on the state

1218
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:59,990
of international law are they subtly

1219
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,660
signaling to us that it is inadequate in

1220
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:05,899
some sense are these the beginning

1221
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:09,350
stages of movements in international on

1222
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:12,310
attribution but to answer Lisa a

1223
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:14,990
question directly you often need to

1224
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:17,690
attribute in law in order to protect

1225
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:19,520
your legal rights you don't only need to

1226
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:22,010
attribute to engage in self defense

1227
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,650
pursuant to article 51 of the UN Charter

1228
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:27,080
you also need to tribute to engage in

1229
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,790
for example countermeasures you can only

1230
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,069
engage in countermeasures against the

1231
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:35,210
state if there is a state behind a cyber

1232
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:38,750
operation so there are reasons for which

1233
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:41,420
attribution is required also in law but

1234
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:45,110
as to the public statements and whether

1235
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:47,470
they whether they reflect a

1236
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:50,720
dissatisfaction with international law

1237
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:54,200
not necessarily I would say I just think

1238
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:57,410
that states are unwilling to draw those

1239
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:02,240
draw those lines in the sand to be to be

1240
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:04,399
quite honest and and there is a lot of

1241
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,279
talk about cyber stability maintaining

1242
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,560
cyber stability well maybe it is in the

1243
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,140
more powerful states interest to

1244
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,360
maintain this type of stability that we

1245
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,540
have right now rather than to have

1246
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,220
restrictive rules that not only take

1247
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,170
options off the table for other

1248
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,049
countries but also options off the table

1249
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:28,370
for themselves other panel members on

1250
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:31,730
the question no I mean obviously I said

1251
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:35,330
there are reasons that attribution could

1252
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:38,030
benefit I mean that reasons are showing

1253
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:40,790
publicly that there are rules that these

1254
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:43,039
rules when you violate them that there

1255
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:46,460
could be consequences

1256
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:51,920
it could be pointing out certain threats

1257
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:54,979
it could be making sure that you engage

1258
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,200
directly with the perpetrator to to have

1259
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:57,680
an understanding what's right and what's

1260
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,019
wrong

1261
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,328
however attribution is never something

1262
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:05,569
in itself it's not something that you do

1263
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:08,569
and that's the end of the case and just

1264
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:11,119
pointing out because you can it's also

1265
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:13,249
not leading to anything so I think when

1266
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,109
you look at attribution and why are you

1267
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:18,049
doing it it's because it fits into your

1268
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:20,089
wider approach so you have a certain

1269
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:21,890
perpetrator you see threats maybe

1270
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:23,690
incidents coming and then you're

1271
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,519
thinking about what is my strategy what

1272
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,119
kind of measures do we I have in my

1273
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,700
toolbox

1274
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:31,789
what do kind of relations do I have with

1275
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:34,069
third countries or with international

1276
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:36,349
organizations and how can we leverage

1277
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:39,558
everything we have to influence the

1278
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:41,539
behavior of this particular state into

1279
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:44,059
the direction of responsible behavior

1280
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:47,029
and attribution could be one element of

1281
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:49,579
this but it's certainly not the only

1282
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,829
element because in the end if you if you

1283
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:54,950
name and shame some states are not even

1284
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:57,799
receptive to that and I like the

1285
00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:00,140
thinking indeed of some states might

1286
00:56:57,799 --> 00:57:03,469
even like it because it gives them the

1287
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:07,489
posture they need on the international

1288
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:09,559
stage so my plea is to really think

1289
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:13,309
about okay what can a traditional

1290
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:15,499
attribution do in our wider approach to

1291
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:20,119
make sure that we influence behavior in

1292
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:22,609
the endgame of cyber civility well great

1293
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,349
points I totally agree

1294
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:25,848
you can't some if many have said this

1295
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:28,789
before me but it's hard to shame too

1296
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:30,950
shameless right so we escalate maybe

1297
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:32,900
sanctions may be offensive cyber

1298
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,729
operations and I love the question

1299
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,430
that's a great question it just reminds

1300
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:39,558
me of sort of a military thing that we

1301
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:42,919
think about is especially as legal

1302
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:46,309
advisors can you do something and should

1303
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,619
you right so again this is not directly

1304
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:50,210
responsive but there's many things we

1305
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:51,319
don't want to reveal sources and that

1306
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,749
sort of thing we don't want to escalate

1307
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:55,310
not necessarily any one particular state

1308
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:57,830
but a lot of states are thinking of that

1309
00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:02,029
so even if you could as a matter of law

1310
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:04,370
or your you willing to as a state should

1311
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:07,730
you so that's just something that I

1312
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:10,670
think it reinforces your point Lisa and

1313
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:14,900
it's it's a great one but it does fit in

1314
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:17,480
nicely and I I defer to these a manam on

1315
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,890
their points okay there was one more

1316
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:25,060
question I believe in the middle

1317
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:25,060
gentleman in the blue jacket yes you sir

1318
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:32,960
we do you have a microphone I think

1319
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:39,610
we're being recorded here we go it's

1320
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:42,140
coming your way thanks for that okay

1321
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:44,630
specifically I was gonna ask about the

1322
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,460
attribution and more in depth about what

1323
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:48,440
plans do you have for what you were

1324
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,420
talking about doing a body that could

1325
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,620
sort of centralize this process the

1326
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,450
reason why I want to ask this is because

1327
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,520
actually I'm from fire right now you

1328
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,990
mentioned mandiant earlier for example

1329
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,480
our organization does a lot of this

1330
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:01,100
attribution process and what I can see

1331
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,980
as an Intel analyst is basically

1332
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:06,259
different organizations come up let's

1333
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,970
say we come up with different results on

1334
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,920
what the clusters of activity look like

1335
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,359
because oftentimes sometimes we can find

1336
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,580
very clear stuff something it's very

1337
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,050
easy to know who it was but something

1338
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,640
it's a bit more complicated and you can

1339
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,960
find different closer of activity that

1340
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,140
do not match for one or another reason

1341
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,730
so if we were to have a body in the

1342
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,470
middle trying to make that decision I

1343
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,900
just wanted to ask about your thoughts

1344
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:29,149
of how would it look like like would it

1345
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,290
go to private sector and see I don't

1346
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,460
know like the results from many

1347
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,470
different companies in trying to

1348
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,150
moderate would it be that we have a new

1349
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,649
organism that does attribution and

1350
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,540
that's the attribution that counts I

1351
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,910
don't know like how would you solve this

1352
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,259
uncertainty over the attribution I know

1353
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,500
it sounds like that second question is

1354
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:49,310
coming around yeah not because we have a

1355
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:51,200
body and that's a state and you know the

1356
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:53,720
state attributes it's their sovereign

1357
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,580
decision so if you have data put it out

1358
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,069
there great open source intelligence

1359
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:59,690
open source information can be gathered

1360
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:02,360
by States and states can take that

1361
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:05,270
decision on their own so there's no need

1362
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,640
to have a private entity it's attributed

1363
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,520
for a state the state has this has his

1364
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,620
own capability

1365
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,840
to do so and if they want this they can

1366
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,630
do to certain EU level coordinated or

1367
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:21,510
with other partners so I understand

1368
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:24,990
there's a need to well present the data

1369
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:28,680
that you have but great put it online

1370
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:30,629
we'll use it this is sort of a well-worn

1371
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,490
approach to international law right that

1372
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:35,640
we could just fix it if we took it out

1373
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:37,200
of the hands of states any are we all

1374
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,450
sovereign tests here on the panel and

1375
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,430
any warming to the proposal that maybe

1376
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,680
this we'd all just be better off if some

1377
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,899
some neutral independent detached body

1378
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,190
we're making these states rather than or

1379
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:51,060
making these decisions rather than

1380
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:53,790
states pleased to be honest I haven't

1381
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:55,860
given a lot of thought to this I think

1382
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:59,190
those proposals are born out of

1383
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:01,590
frustration with the status quo there's

1384
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:03,810
this feeling that we need to take the

1385
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:05,910
situation further somehow and if states

1386
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:08,009
are not attributing the states are not

1387
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:09,690
taking action states are not drawing

1388
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:14,370
lines in the sand well maybe somebody

1389
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:15,180
else should so I guess I'm somewhere in

1390
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,670
between

1391
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:19,950
I too am somewhat frustrated with the

1392
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:22,440
states to be honest with you especially

1393
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:26,700
the more capable states who are in a

1394
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:29,640
position to to advance normative order

1395
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:32,640
in cyberspace I think most countries

1396
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:34,680
actually in the world today are not

1397
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,009
involved in this debate at a very high

1398
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,720
level they are only catching up but but

1399
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:43,200
the states that could advance rule of

1400
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,750
long line norms of responsible state

1401
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,689
behavior online and they are reluctant

1402
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:53,840
to do so for various reasons and and

1403
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:55,830
often I do think they should Ron I think

1404
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,010
we have seen some private companies

1405
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:00,509
attribute right private industry folks

1406
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:02,790
and again not going into a ton of

1407
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:06,300
examples but not in a definitive or

1408
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:07,590
abiding way right right yeah some have

1409
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,230
argued they're faster they're more

1410
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,790
detailed their broader different

1411
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,740
motivations different implications of

1412
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:15,900
private sector attributing over public

1413
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,669
obviously and but one thing I found

1414
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,470
compelling for that argument and the

1415
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,790
sort of the reason I meant is you could

1416
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:25,000
persuade different audiences who may

1417
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:27,100
sceptical of states motivations as a

1418
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,040
combination of law policy and that sort

1419
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:32,049
of thing you you certainly could reach a

1420
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,110
different audience if you had a central

1421
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:38,080
attribution body or just private-sector

1422
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:39,850
attributions and I think that's

1423
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:42,460
important too

1424
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:44,339
of course the analogy you could have a

1425
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,240
bounty hunter be very quick about

1426
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,950
something that a law enforcement might

1427
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,450
not be able to and that doesn't mean we

1428
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:54,120
shouldn't have law enforcement do the

1429
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:56,859
job it just sort of something I think of

1430
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:59,140
there are considerations on all sides so

1431
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:01,900
it's like a great job security for law

1432
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:04,810
professors right yeah yeah John Kennedy

1433
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:08,500
maybe pick up on what what has been said

1434
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:10,750
because horseman I I recognize that the

1435
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:15,570
audience part and the credibility part

1436
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:18,790
but if something happens it's not that

1437
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:21,340
private entities are not engaged in this

1438
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:23,770
and not putting it out there so they are

1439
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:26,110
the question is should they bundle their

1440
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:29,590
sources and should they come together in

1441
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:31,870
a council and then provide one advice to

1442
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:36,430
States and now you know please act on it

1443
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:39,100
so of course when I'm I'm assure that

1444
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:41,109
when the state will respond and I mean

1445
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:44,020
will when they will do it with measures

1446
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:46,410
that go beyond just declaratory there

1447
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:49,150
will be definitely private sector

1448
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:52,180
engagement and private sector

1449
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:56,320
conclusions that supports this action so

1450
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:58,330
I don't see one or the other as it's not

1451
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:01,150
a contradictory so not wanting a

1452
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:02,529
partnership sorry time is winding down a

1453
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:05,290
bit but I think we have several

1454
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:07,630
questions why don't we take them sort of

1455
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:09,880
in serial order I see a question here

1456
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:12,130
the gentleman the bass jacket as well

1457
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,860
one in the back could we take all three

1458
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:17,650
questions back-to-back and I'll let the

1459
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:21,070
panelists take those up as they as they

1460
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:23,440
choose please professor Barnes be with

1461
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:24,970
your proposed framework do you think a

1462
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,410
standardized punishment procedure would

1463
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:30,250
affect a state's willingness to accept

1464
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:32,230
attribution okay well well hold that one

1465
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:36,210
that one's directed at Professor Barnes

1466
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:40,630
be the gentleman in the front here

1467
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:42,999
hello Kooskia in krakow so my question

1468
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:46,180
also goes to Professor bronze B and so

1469
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:48,209
you spoke about one of the motivations

1470
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,558
for the states of not caring about

1471
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:52,329
attributions is the exploitation of grey

1472
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,579
zones of international law but my

1473
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:56,619
question would be are we not in a

1474
01:04:54,579 --> 01:05:00,839
certain way contributing to this grey

1475
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:03,609
zone by for instance certain states

1476
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:05,609
denying the the existence of certain

1477
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:08,288
rules such as the rule of sovereignty in

1478
01:05:05,609 --> 01:05:11,288
cyberspace and therefore you know why

1479
01:05:08,289 --> 01:05:13,509
should a state care about being

1480
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:16,359
attributed with a conduct that is not

1481
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:18,670
really a violation of any particular

1482
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:23,229
rule of international law thank you

1483
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:27,069
thank you and in the back oh this is

1484
01:05:23,229 --> 01:05:31,689
Barry yeah right right there on the side

1485
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:33,369
here yeah Barry the final question is

1486
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:36,729
yours okay thank you

1487
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:38,319
Barry sanda FGP Brazil I just want to

1488
01:05:36,729 --> 01:05:39,189
return to the earlier question because

1489
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,160
although it was a really interesting

1490
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:43,420
question about the value added of

1491
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,578
international law the value added of

1492
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,839
attribution because if you ask an

1493
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:48,190
international lawyer what's the value

1494
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:51,069
added of attribution of below the

1495
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:52,869
threshold operations the immediate

1496
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:55,029
answer is well you get access to

1497
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:56,799
countermeasures but I think that's the

1498
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:59,489
elephant in the room is that states

1499
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:02,950
haven't really come up with effective

1500
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:05,410
countermeasures which motivate them to

1501
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,359
actually attribute and I think we maybe

1502
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,890
could benefit and this is the question

1503
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,920
would you agree we could maybe benefit

1504
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:14,038
from a wider discussion of what

1505
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,920
effective countermeasures would be

1506
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,369
against peacetime cyber operations

1507
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,930
thanks Barry

1508
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:23,469
so Rob let's start with you and then

1509
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:26,739
we'll work our way down the panel for

1510
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:28,269
Kevin our cadet I feel like you could

1511
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:30,339
have asked that question three weeks ago

1512
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:32,549
about 5,000 miles west of here I was a

1513
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:32,549
kidding

1514
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:37,619
great job stepping up asking questions I

1515
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:41,229
love it so standard punishment structure

1516
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:42,969
I just feel like it's a great idea I

1517
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:44,109
feel like every every situations

1518
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:46,869
different so it'd be hard to

1519
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:49,089
standardized right classic answer we

1520
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,480
there are the motivations we have to all

1521
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:51,460
talk

1522
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,710
about and so you probably would not see

1523
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,589
that it feeds into the second question

1524
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:59,079
right a little bit which is are we

1525
01:06:56,589 --> 01:07:01,078
helping things by by taking what could

1526
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:03,280
be a very clear standard instructions

1527
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,349
Direction control and saying well this

1528
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,349
is this is very hard to figure out what

1529
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:11,410
instructions are and that sort of thing

1530
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:14,619
perhaps there you know again or a lawyer

1531
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:17,649
talking making policy arguments like me

1532
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:19,570
not helping out very much and I think

1533
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:22,470
it's a great point I don't quite

1534
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:26,500
disagree with that question either so

1535
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:29,098
classic response but that's those are my

1536
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:33,550
initial thoughts I know your thoughts

1537
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:36,520
well I think just would like to respond

1538
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:40,660
to the last question because although we

1539
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,940
need to discuss these issues indeed the

1540
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:46,180
question is if they would always need to

1541
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:49,270
be put to the forefront

1542
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:53,020
there's work ahead this work should be

1543
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:55,150
done in the UN gge we should discuss how

1544
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:56,890
international law applies and we should

1545
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,630
further work on the norms of responsible

1546
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,848
state behavior in particular when it

1547
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:02,920
comes to implementation but we should

1548
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:06,810
also bear in mind that we do not want

1549
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,700
escalation in cyberspace we do not want

1550
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:11,650
cyberspace to be used for all kinds of

1551
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,618
strategic objectives by States because

1552
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:18,480
in the end who will suffer from it all

1553
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:22,029
of us so yes there is a discussion about

1554
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:24,160
how countermeasures work and all the

1555
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:25,989
conditions etc but we should also bear

1556
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,000
in mind that in principle we're working

1557
01:08:25,988 --> 01:08:30,099
here on stability

1558
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,460
so if attribution could contribute to

1559
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,640
that yes we should do it and there are

1560
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:38,319
several ways in which we could apply it

1561
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,049
even non-public ways it should not

1562
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,880
always be out in the open naming and

1563
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:46,000
shaming and pointing fingers sometimes

1564
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:51,690
not even effective but we should keep

1565
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,939
our eyes on the ball and and not try to

1566
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:57,790
to escalate unnecessarily because it's

1567
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:58,950
fashion please the first end the final

1568
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:01,630
word goes to you

1569
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:03,670
so pick the question about

1570
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,750
so what is the value of naming and

1571
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:07,779
shaming different not naming and shaming

1572
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,130
for violations of the law I agree with

1573
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:11,409
you that cherry-picking

1574
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:14,400
irrespective of which country which side

1575
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:17,920
is cherry-picking is problematic and it

1576
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:20,259
takes away the moral ground of a state

1577
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,299
to say that cyberspace is governed by

1578
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:23,979
international law if the state at the

1579
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:25,899
same time is cherry-picking which rules

1580
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:28,858
of international law apply and do not

1581
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:31,899
apply so I agree that this is a problem

1582
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:33,850
the dew accusations of states having

1583
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:36,219
violated international law carry more

1584
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,380
weight than accusations of states having

1585
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:41,759
reached norms of responsible state

1586
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:44,770
behavior I think to an extent they do

1587
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,750
yes sometimes states may not mind them

1588
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:48,580
but probably there is only one country

1589
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,529
in the world that doesn't care at all

1590
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,719
when it's labeled a lawbreaker that's

1591
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:56,050
North Korea but even countries like

1592
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,300
Russia and China they do care when

1593
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:00,190
they're labeled lawbreakers Russia

1594
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,260
worked quite hard in the Security

1595
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:04,530
Council to justify its invasion of

1596
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:07,659
Ukraine as an exercise of self-defense

1597
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:10,000
China outside the cyber context works

1598
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:11,830
very hard to justify its an evil

1599
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,199
maneuvers in the law of the sea

1600
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:16,330
so no country maybe except for North

1601
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:19,480
Korea wants to be labeled a lawbreaker

1602
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:21,370
in international relations and even if

1603
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,019
this the naming achievement for having

1604
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:26,010
violated international law doesn't

1605
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,929
change their behavior it nevertheless

1606
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:32,070
imposes cost even if it is minimal cost

1607
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:34,870
it imposes reputational cost on them

1608
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:37,000
well we are precisely on time please

1609
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:39,420
join me in thanking the panelists for

1610
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,420
their thoughts

1611
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:44,530
you
