1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
as the importance of bringing in the

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,359
military academia and industry together

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,730
has been stressed here already several

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,429
times today we would like to invite for

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,250

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,770
lieutenant general Robert che to share

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,279
his thoughts on the cyberspace state of

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,830
play as the industry keynote attorney

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,630

electronics Association

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,240
prior to assuming this position he

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,369
served as the strategic solutions

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,829
executive vice president for smart

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,500
tronics his last active duty position

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,950

Joint Staff alternate general Shea she

18

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,860
where he was responsible for developing

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,390
nothing else than the first u.s.

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,829
national military strategy for

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,500
cyberspace operations

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,930
so please welcome lieutenant general

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,119
shape

27
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,119
[Applause]

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,659
well thank you very much it's it's great

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,390
to be back in town and I was here a few

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,780
years ago with a coon Whisperer here and

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,130
we we did an event here and I certainly

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,290
have nothing but great things to say

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,270
about the hospitality never even that's

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,150
been shown to us so far and as it has

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,890
been in the past just to be clear I'm

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,170
not from industry I'm from an

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,119
association that represents industry

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,640
government and academia in terms of

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,039
cyber intelligence homeland security

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,850
issues national security issues as well

41
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,990
as technology issues so I my job is try

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,940
to bring the industry government and

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,580
academia together to solve problems to

44
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,560
fall within those different reims realms

45
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,840
you know one of the challenges that I

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,970
see and I think general biank brought it

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
up before was the lexicon when we talk

48
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,990
about cyber we tend to talk past each

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,759
other some cases are we talking about

50
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,050
the network are we talking about data

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,850
are we talking about information

52
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,979
operations are we talking about

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,080
resilience are we talking about command

54
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,090
and control exploit attack all those

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,070
different things so I think it's a it's

56
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,840
it was a good sign to hear that the the

57
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,760
common lexicon is starting to come

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
together here and I think that's a very

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,590
very important piece I'm going to start

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,290
off talking about from a sort of a high

61
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,750
level strategic view and then I'm going

62
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,459
to kind of shift gears a little bit and

63
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,230
then shift back and forth I'm going to

64
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,600
talk about information I'm going to talk

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,880
about social media and then I'm going to

66
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,799
give some thoughts and observations I've

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,489
been in the working a world of cyber

68
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:39,329
since strongly since 1995 when I was a

69
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,489
director of command and control

70
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,110
communications for what was then the

71
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,610
United States Pacific Command we were

72
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,579
the target of the first national

73
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,290
military exercise on cyber and I thought

74
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,570
I had a pretty good handle on it but

75
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,250
I've been learning ever since and as was

76
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,440
mentioned I had the responsibility for

77
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,540
putting together the first national

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,170
military strategy on cyber operations

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,390
about 10 years ago 12 years ago

80
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,059
but my my views on the world of cyber

81
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,309
and information operations continue to

82
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,170
evolve and change and I would suggest

83
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,030
that something we all need to be mindful

84
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,010
that the world is changing so is this

85
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,020
world of cyber information operations

86
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,140
and all those things that go along with

87
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,220
they're evolving as well from where I'm

88
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,989
sitting and I'm going to give this

89
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,700
respect my perspective from right where

90
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,290
I'm sitting well we're in a period of

91
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,299
great power competition right now

92
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,760
there's a little doubt that we're in

93
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,280
this era of competition pitting

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,410
authoritarian regimes such as China

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,810
Russia versus democratic government such

96
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,450
as the United States members of the EU

97
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,250
and the NATO partners in this light the

98
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,170
importance of cyber and information

99
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,480
operations are taken on an increasingly

100
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,260
important role

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,929
China and Russia bring a

102
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,179
whole-of-government approach to cyber

103
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,940
and information conflict and there are

104
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,260
less concerns about the legal

105
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,690
separations that underpin democratic

106
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,670
societies well there focuses may be

107
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,730
different the end states are very

108
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,559
similar with authoritarian regimes it's

109
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,929
easier to call us all the elements of

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,790
national power versus the debate and

111
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,120
that can encumber and in slow

112
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,160
democracies to action for divide for

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,170
democracies to effectively compete in

114
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,238
this environment there must be a tighter

115
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,370
coupling between all elements of

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,739
national power and international power

117
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,260
to include academia and like-minded

118
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,090
partners and what I'm referring to I'm

119
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,310
referring to the economic the military

120
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,830
the political the diplomatic and the

121
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,040
Information spheres of what we have to

122
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,620
deal on a regular basis in all resources

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,810
and Evi brought to bear to deal with the

124
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,750
problem in an integrated manner the

125
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,710
stovepipes have to be broken down and

126
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,080
governments need to further and better

127
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,080
exchange threat data with industry and

128
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,050
academia in a timely relevant and

129
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,419
actionable manner there needs to be more

130
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,740
than just rhetoric the overall

131
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,470
classification of threat information

132
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,530
needs to be re-examined all the while

133
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,850
protecting methods and sources and

134
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,669
democracies need to rapidly adapt and

135
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,890
adjust to the new to the new tech driven

136
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,340
environment legal frameworks and

137
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,020
bureaucracy must adapt as well

138
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:16,169
unfortunately the bureaucracy can be

139
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:20,490
crushing at times and speed of action is

140
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:22,650
crucial if we're not in phase 3 of an

141
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,590
information conflict we're on the

142
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,099
precipice unfortunately it's not evident

143
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,849
to many of the public and some don't

144
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,580
even recognize

145
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:36,119
a conflict about they become numb to the

146
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,669
challenge and perhaps even skeptical the

147
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:41,009
consequences are not obvious at least

148
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:43,859
for the present where cyber is the

149
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,619
battlespace data leading to information

150
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,169
and understanding are the crown jewels

151
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:51,539
and the ability to affect decision

152
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:54,688
making at speed of action are decisive

153
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,089
factors the two skilfully integrated are

154
00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:00,539
a force multiplier perhaps even the

155
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:02,279
decisive factor in future conflict our

156
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,169
competitors are continuously moving the

157
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,689
pieces on the strategic chessboard

158
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,359
we need to aggressively retake the

159
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,999
initiative open our minds and new ways

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,379
of doing business and invest and the

161
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:16,289
development of new technologies and

162
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,869
processes while still beat while still

163
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,998
being mindful of the old ways in messes

164
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:23,189
because they often form the foundation

165
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:27,149
of future thought and we must embrace

166
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:29,580
diversity and thought and in action and

167
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,009
across the different demographics if

168
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,878
we're going to compete as Jack Welch

169
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:38,610
this former CEO of GE once said if the

170
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,399
rate of change on the outside exceeds

171
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,869
the rate of change on the inside the end

172
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,610
is near from where I sit Russia's

173
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,919
strategic goal is to fracture the

174
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,099
Alliance and marginalize NATO and the

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,128
u.s. relationship to undermine

176
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,438
democratic ideals they've been in crop

177
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:01,459
involved across the entire spectrum war

178
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,189
less nuclear in the last several years

179
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,809
they're employing many old concepts

180
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,149
reinforced with new tools and methods

181
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:10,740
they know how to definitely operate in

182
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,009
the gray zone using cyber and

183
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,659
information to shape the battlespace

184
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,759
influence operations and there are

185
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:20,969
political agenda while keeping the West

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,919
off balance a key element for Russia

187
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,659
among others is sharing and

188
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,659
disseminating disinformation and

189
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:29,369
misinformation through social media the

190
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,159
Russian television Russia Internet

191
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:34,050
Agency Russian intelligence and a host

192
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,748
of other surrogates contributing to the

193
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,629
effort they're particularly skilled in

194
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:41,339
weaponizing social media they have

195
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,910
learned to leverage modern digital

196
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,770
advertising and mark

197
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,140
techniques and integrate them into

198
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,390
practices as well as investing in and

199
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,990
leveraging non-government proxies to

200
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:55,000
mask their efforts their focus is to

201
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,850
undermine and create seams and

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,540
weaknesses in the social political and

203
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,250
political fabric and democratic norms

204
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,920
now if I could turn just briefly for a

205
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,400
few minutes to China China is usually

206
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,010
using a more subtle set of this silent

207
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,169
conflict there they're looking to

208
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,140
restore China what they view is their

209
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,700
rightful place in the world

210
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,469
unfortunately for China the documented

211
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,440
record does not necessarily reflect

212
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,960
China's recollection of history if their

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,090
ultimate goal is to supplant American

214
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,460

abrogating governance and influence of

further advantage to the China there is

254
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,640
a continued changed pressure to buy

internally the Chinese social credit

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,099
system was designed to provide state

279
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,500
control over the population it is a

280
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,960
system designed to ensure the Communist

281
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,910
Chinese party remains in control in

282
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,270
light of new technology exposing the

populace outside of the outside world

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,150
and the benefits of a free society

285
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,710
they're combining big data many aspects

286
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,020

288
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,920
techniques and gait analysis couple with

289
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,740
aggressive policing to maintain control

290
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,229
and influence over the populations all

291
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,970
this is centered around information the

292
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,250
ability to disseminate collect

293
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,200
information they're gathering

294
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,720
comprehensive data on their population

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,030
and beyond tying it to the social credit

296
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,280
system and promotions and opportunity

297
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,900
within their own country and I would

298
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,640
argue you can look in witness the

299
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,090
repressive control over the weekers in

300
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,720
the West internally China is rapidly

301
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:59,450
moving to the world of George Orwell's

302
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,400
1984 and for those of you who may not

303
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,830
have read it was published over 70 years

304
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,800
ago where he described the effects of

305
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,619
totalitarian government

306
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,709
with stick government control control

307
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:14,199
and oppression of its citizens they have

308
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:17,859
recognized that information truly is

309
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,988
power and what does that pretend to

310
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,429
others and the future if they have

311
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:27,189
access to this information globally

312
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:30,579
given this the question I regularly ask

313
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:33,279
myself is why would one want to

314
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,469
integrate the IT infrastructure of 5g

315
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,959
from a company that is strongly

316
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,749
influenced by partnership with such an

317
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,729
authoritarian regime a nation why do

318
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:45,579
recognize for theft of intellectual

319
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,499
property one that demonstrates a little

320
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:50,618
regard for Eckerd internationally

321
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:52,540
recognized norms and laws one that

322
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:55,149
places tight controls and severe

323
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,679
penalties over its people a nation that

324
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,259
has potential to negatively impact

325
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,720
privacy national sovereignty of other

326
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,399
countries as it develops is in NASH

327
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,059
international infrastructure and

328
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:11,290
strategy reinforcing state control what

329
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:13,719
is the business case for a discounted 5g

330
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,170
infrastructure when measured against the

331
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,079
loss of freedom the loss of intellectual

332
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,240
property and sensitive data future

333
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,479
political influence and threats to

334
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,420
future security one where privacy takes

335
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,420
a backseat to desires at the party do

336

leaders Western really leaders really

337
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,729
understand the long term implications of

338
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,759
risk of stronger key IT infrastructure

339
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,829
against the political and economic games

340
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:45,910
so on this world of soft soft

341
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:48,008
confrontation is something I think needs

342
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,319
to be taken very seriously well

343
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,689
unfortunately we have not sufficiently

344
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:54,219
demonstrated the political will power to

345
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,709
address cyber or information

346
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,660
confrontation Western allies are

347
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,518
perceived to have established a norm

348
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,969
they will not that will not likely

349
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,499
respond to attacks and these types of

350
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:08,309
incursions and the potential

351
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:10,989
ramifications for NATO are significant

352
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:14,139
what is the point of putting trusted

353
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:18,399
systems on a network that is not secure

354
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,540
or vulnerable I'd like to briefly just

355
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,970
turn them into social

356
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,500
you information particularly when

357
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,750
tightly tightly coupled with other

358
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,160
elements of national power is a powerful

359
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,680
force often targeting useful idiots

360
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,709
reinforcing the movement of a singular

361
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,050
thought accordingly the accumulated

362
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:41,170
power of information and control in the

363
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,758
hands of a few affecting the masses is

364
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,479
something that should be concerned to

365
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,190
everyone particularly free societies

366
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,860
social media as well as tools to

367
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,050
automate distribution and the selective

368
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,149
targeting of information leveraging

369
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,490
leveraging advances and artificial

370
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,319
intelligence and big data has made it

371
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,680
easier to distribute distorted

372
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:04,389
information to select audiences even

373
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,689
individuals bias information

374
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,660
misinformation and disinformation are

375
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,170
being used to divide the populace into

376
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,469
select groups or tribes fake news is

377
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:21,370
pervasive control of the message is the

378
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:23,860
key for those worried about government

379
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,870
government ease dropping spying and the

380
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,060
affront to civil liberties by government

381
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,630
interference and government agencies I

382
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,579
have a question are the social media and

383
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,410
technology companies collecting more

384
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,620
sensitive information than the

385
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,850
government to what end

386
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,190
sharing it to increase their power and

387
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,190
influence what is the impact on

388
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,709
democratic societies what are they doing

389
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,510
with this accumulated information

390
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,989
selling it using for political or

391
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,240
economic gain social stratification

392
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,490
social divide imagine the power being

393
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,940
being placed in the hands of a smell of

394
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,240
a relatively small group of industry

395
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,839
outside of duly elected government

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,029
officials who are given oversight then

397
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,699
there's the paradox of social privacy

398
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,279
and political consciousness of the GDP

399
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,930
are and eagerness of some to partner

400
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,850
with a body that enables and even

401
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,589
promotes the theft of intellectual

402
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,829
property and other sensitive and

403
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:26,410
personal data one that promotes control

404
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,750
over the populace we need to break down

405
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,540
the soda straw that many citizens

406
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,990
exhibit looking only at information that

407
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,020
supports their personal

408
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:38,000
views and trusted sources leasing them

409
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,579
to be easily swayed by false and

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,500
misinformation there is a need to

411
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,320
develop programs to help people know how

412
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,720
to evaluate trustworthiness of sources

413
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,270
and information one that requires

414
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,170
emphasis on critical thinking skills a

415
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,360
skill that has been lost by many again

416
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,120
in the battle of information the Fourth

417
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,589
Estate in my view has let us down they

418
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,839
have in many ways wittingly or

419
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:06,079
unwittingly become the host and purveyor

420
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,559
of misinformation or disinformation the

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,959
half-life of truth continues to shrink

422
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,720
in a world that is dominated by

423
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,350
information in multiple sources where

424
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,540
does one go to find the truth I'm often

425
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,659
reminded of when I when I think about

426
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,970
this of Diogenes going around Athens

427
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,210
looking for an honest man where does one

428
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,610
go to find the truth unfortunately the

429
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,780
truth is often buried under a mountain

430
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,090
lies where virility Trump's veracity we

431
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,360
traditionally think of conflict in war

432
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,280
in kinetic terms one has to wonder if

433
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,610
we're heading toward a world where

434
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,670
social media and data intense technology

435
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,820
companies become so powerful that they

436
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,740
are viewed as the mortal enemies

437
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,800
themselves by nation states and other

438
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,350
threat actors the aget aggregation and

439
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,090
the accumulation of so much data which

440
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,639
tremendous and information puts

441
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,129
tremendous power into the private sector

442
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,860
and how that plays out in the context of

443
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,380
cyber context and social political norms

444
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,030
of Beyond has yet to play out the

445
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,160
blurring between nation-states and

446
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,990
criminal activities continues while the

447
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
lack of response to cyber security and

448
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,040
information activities can

449
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,460
unintentionally signal acceptance or

450
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,159
lack of resolve having said this some

451
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,450
final thoughts industry and government

452
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,580
are drowning and threat data

453
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,070
highlighting the need for improved

454
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,409
automation to separate the noise from

455
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,750
the intelligence we must develop tools

456
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,240
for a deeper understanding beyond the

457
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,070
technical characteristics of attack we

458
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,100
need to know why in order to

459
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,000
appropriately shape a response there is

460
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,350
a need for a full

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,809
court press on artificial intelligence

462
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,418
machine learning and quantum technology

463
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,940
these are our technology racist we can't

464
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:57,650
lose we must recognize that we can't

465
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,030
afford to do everything there's not

466
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,980
enough money out there for everything to

467
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,200
be done but we need the intellectual

468
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,200
courage and a leadership to focus on the

469
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,640
mission and set aside as best we can

470
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,559
the nice-to-haves the cyber domain

471
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,480
requires an integrated structure of

472
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,370
command and control the ability to go

473
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,530
after the adversary the ability to

474
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,620
defend the ability to provide

475
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,649
intelligence the needs and a strong

476
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,408
command and control structure cyber and

477
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:30,710
information needs to develop also as a

478
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:33,679
tool of statecraft how do we integrate

479
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,330
this into our diplomacy there is a need

480
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,210
to find things that matter most of the

481
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,780
adversary and put constant pressure on

482
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,659
them some may not always be in the cyber

483
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,720
domain our systems and infrastructure

484
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:50,030
need the resilience to show that attack

485
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,850
and exploitation are not worth the

486
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:57,559
effort we must raise the bar in this

487
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,870
regard and we need a new internet one we

488
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,970
the one we have now was never intended

489
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:06,830
to do the things that was done that it's

490
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:09,260
been asked to do it's been and I would

491
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,090
argue there is also a need to review the

492
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,820
technical standards and the aptitude

493
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,520
standards for key positions in the

494
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,010
security and the IT security workforce

495
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,400
are we attracting the right type of

496
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,039
people the right level of diversity I

497
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,390
don't think so we need to build a

498
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,490
workforce and standards and

499
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,010
certifications that approach those

500
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,440
required of men and more women working

501
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,690
in technical industries such as the

502
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,970
nuclear power industry we need our

503
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,250
workforce jumping over the standards bar

504
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,130
not tripping over it when it comes to

505
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,110
training and certifications imagine what

506
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,500
lingers in our networks waiting for

507
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,209
direct board the directive to activate

508
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,940
the real threat is what we don't know

509
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,490
one could argue that the adversaries ape

510
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,730
team and maybe even the B team are not

511
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,770
getting caught and finally there is a

512
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,890
need for a tightly focused now

513
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,470
and international leadership that is

514
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,960
thus far been slow to emerge we're

515
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,330
buried in the bureaucracy and left to

516
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,040
its own devices the bureaucracy will

517
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,540
choose failure over change every time

518
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,500
and if I could close with one final

519
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,200
thought victorious warriors and this is

520
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,100
a quote from Sun Tzu a great quote the

521
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,970
chorus victorious warriors win first and

522
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,969
then go to war

523
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,670
well defeated warriors go to war first

524
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,939
then seek to win thank you very much

525
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,939
