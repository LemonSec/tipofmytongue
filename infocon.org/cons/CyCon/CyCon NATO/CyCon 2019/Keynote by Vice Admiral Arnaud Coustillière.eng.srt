1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,069
generals official indeed gentlemen it is

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,649
a great pleasure to be with you again

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:13,230
ere and immediately I beg your pardon

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:15,240
for my French accents today after six

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,270
years at the aid of the French zebra

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,000
defense as the first calm summer and

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,920
then two years as general director of

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,189
the digital information and data for the

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,650
friend reserve defense I can measure the

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,219
progress we have made in your French

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:36,329
Estonian corporation notably within the

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,149
center of excellence that so the reason

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,570
why I am honoured to contribute to this

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,210
conference Estonian is for us the most

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,239
advanced country in Europe in terms of

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,940
digital technology once again I would

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,519
like to act like an acknowledge the work

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,879
done by Estonia during his time as

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,649
president of the European Union and its

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,908
influence on International Forum today I

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,979
can only observe the digital society is

22
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,900
on the move

23
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:13,590
observes an Estonian is Europe's

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,830
Laboratory in jazz new digital societies

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,750
and that the Data revolution is

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,150
preparing us for it consequently we must

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,060
foresee the structure of those societies

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:34,110
and erect security and confidence as

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,040
component of its DNA data is a

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,740
cornerstone of all your challenge

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,810
whether we are talking about cyber big

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:49,439
data cloud or artificial intelligence in

33
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,619
this field Estonia is opinion for

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,908
instance explode is mentioned as an

35
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,520
example in France by authorities notably

36
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,219
by the Secretary of State for digital

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,639
technology the 2010 were intelligence

38
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,280
and espionage times then the are aware

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,179
of the case such strokes net or coffee

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,720
curve shows us

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:21,810
that sabotage attacks we're accessible

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:26,909
is in a targeted or a general way in

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,470
2014 we have pasted dice propaganda with

44
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,260
disabilities and fragmented war

45
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,010
societies whether in Europe or elsewhere

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,769
and we work the real war through the use

47
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,640
of reference cyber forces against this

48
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:45,099
propaganda today I am happy to say that

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,970
a french-language propaganda has

50
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:51,970
declined considerably and that the

51
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,220
armoured forces that ladies files were

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,190
able to hand over to the internal

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,000
security forces at least for French

54
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,879
language propaganda we also saw the

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,569
emergence of erected interferences in

56
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:11,018
elections attributed to the results then

57
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,048
the issue of fake news became one of the

58
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,889
deck national team stems or yoga with

59
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:21,389
leaders we are therefore a new new era

60
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:24,730
of conflict that can no longer be a nerd

61
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,790
friends like many other states are fully

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:31,268
taken it in a new account in this view

63
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:37,060
military capacity has been created it

64
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:41,079
will have 3,000 expect today and three

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,979
four thousand and five hundred by 2022

66
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:50,590
in comparisons the aspect where less

67
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:52,810
than 300 in 2011 at the each of those

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:57,639
forces we have an operational command

69
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:02,739
the calm cyber well step by step since

70
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:06,190
2011 it has allowed it has a large scale

71
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:09,220
of experts and many other operations in

72
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,739
which they are engaged whether in

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:17,260
support of intervention is a sale muddy

74
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:19,989
or in the Levant Syria and Iran for the

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:24,219
protection or difference of all networks

76
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:26,979
and against propaganda and we talk to

77
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:30,000
say that cyber we have been yet

78
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm seeing extremely important until

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,670
2020 2015 and 16 is taking on a new

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,700
dimension until 2015 in France the focus

81
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:47,080
was on attacks of information system

82
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,360
that were inside your structures I think

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,180
that we must look forward to the

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,940
channels of data security and data

85
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,240
Trust's we are facing two new

86
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,120
revolutions we'll be needing unknown and

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,140
we took and which took off with the

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,200
explosion of Technology first we cannot

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,200
talk about Austin without talking about

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,580
cloud notable data processing without

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,469
talking about artificial intelligence

92
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,979
there are the challenges that are

93
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:24,820
emerging so I think it is important here

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,910
in Terran at the sacrum to look at the

95
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,030
road travel and the one that remains to

96
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,940
be travelled this journey particularly

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:37,450
and ply to review the notion of

98
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,840
sovereignty and therefore we can see

99
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:44,229
alongside sovereign states that digital

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,380
have arrays are your borders we have

101
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,200
seen the arrival of major players who

102
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,830
are almost at the same level of power as

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,039
States well surprisingly the other

104
00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:00,070
gavin's with warm which are common

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,670
values however we cannot enjoy the

106
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,730
emergence of other major players notably

107
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,210
Chinese players with one we do not share

108
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:14,170
the same culture or visual of mankind or

109
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,419
even the same notion of democracy taught

110
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,090
as far as a government is concerned

111
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,750
there is a certain shared vision of

112
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:26,520
progress it's a middle in the middle is

113
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,890
Europe with us it's out culture it

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,680
interesting to note that this is not the

115
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:36,460
first time in history that eternal

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,430
transnational corporations with which

117
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,280
our experiences wrong loss through trod

118
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,420
of

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,539
the power of states as so the energy

120
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,460
because a digital world and the Maritim

121
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:55,630
world seems to me to speak for itself

122
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:59,630
thud start with the cargo transported

123
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:03,110
nowadays cargo is a data at the 18th

124
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,630
century the big shaping companies like

125
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,750
the East India Company the French one

126
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,980
but associate Lee the British one were

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:16,250
almost as powerful as Kingdom but this

128
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:20,330
phenomenon was then regulated by analogy

129
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:24,169
I think we are at the stage states and

130
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:27,140
just large company must work together to

131
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:31,150
get to know each other better and

132
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:35,240
understand that mutual expectation also

133
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:39,979
we can consider that data have become a

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:44,890
sovereign common good Thurid by all

135
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:49,120
citizens and by the respective nation

136
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:52,849
First Nations sir shall protect data

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,669
acreage new means to do so data

138
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,039
protection not limited to the general

139
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:02,210
data protection regulation should be

140
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:06,820
constructed by laws taxes cryptographic

141
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:11,210
means and by Osaka read digital borders

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:14,390
in a matter of third digital borders are

143
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,989
two strings of partners relationship in

144
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:21,229
data and adorn which matters they will

145
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:24,710
find the roots in am indeed social

146
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:31,070
contract when the main parties are

147
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:33,260
states web players and citizens then the

148
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:37,218
implication is term of strategic

149
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:43,909
autonomy the drive server and digital is

150
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:49,150
above disabled above all trust Trust is

151
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:52,860
by by two main elements is a one and

152
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,740
security it is miserable

153
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:00,000
today we can say that such security of

154
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:05,180
government is as well unsure at that of

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,670
many states indeed the old data centers

156
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,130
they are transatlantic links they have

157
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,750
them our cryptology and the order of

158
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:18,959
servers in conclusion they are serenity

159
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,470
worthy of a state over all part of the

160
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,969
digital space

161
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,209
the second element to be taken in

162
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,940
consideration is a community of

163
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:32,518
destinies between the partners do we

164
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,820
have trusted partners this is going

165
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,209
beyond security aspect today between

166
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,720
Arab of France and Microsoft Amazon of

167
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:45,469
Google the question is how can this

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,600
company B's trusted partners other

169
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,540
concern about your strategy or strategic

170

autonomy other concerned about

171
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,870
preserving the personal data of all the

172
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:01,110
citizens do the distinguish between a

173
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,839
citizen and a customer this is a

174
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,740
fundamental distinction because we are

175
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,160
in a democracy well we shall not only

176
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:15,470
find customers but above our friend

177
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,810
citizens was dignity must be respected

178
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,390
just questions our stake and will

179
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,569
reflect our reflect on the relationship

180
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,800
between states and the major web players

181
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:31,500
at least for those with transit rhotic

182
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,160
values value Sharon for very long term

work better together to work together

186
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,449
and to respect citizen personal data and

187
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,820
dignity the first duty of a sovereign

Nevada ISM start shall increase as one

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,869
of the first duties the difference of

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,820
citizens that are in extension of

that that protection misery for be

proteins were fulfilled by all states a

196

business subject of indeed work but

197
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:21,900
politician in order to move away from a

198
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:24,240
purely commercial approach if you are

199
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,069
already experiencing difficulty in

200
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,270
cooperation between Europeans and

201
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:33,360
Americans Gotham it is important to be

202
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,490
fully aware of the tsunami represented

203
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,240
by the illiberal of new bazarov players

204
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,750
in this field namely the Chinese with

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,720
one we shall very few common values in

206
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,590
particular the way in which citizens are

207
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,290
viewed we must therefore act on this

208
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,800
huge challenge may evolve or accelerate

209
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,839
your cooperation

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,050
finally in order to come back to a

211
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:05,070
military area that directly concern us

212
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:08,329
within military coalition one of the

213
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,660
imperatives each mutual is neutral and

214
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:16,500
reciprocal trust to watch each other

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:20,490
towards each other this trust implies

216
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,550
that the decision is not best to do so

217
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:27,870
it is necessary to wrestle your partners

218
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:31,170
of the origin of data and the way in

219
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,300
which algorithm which can be bending of

220
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:37,530
the members of a coalition have been

221
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:40,829
developed and trained is it is therefore

222
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:45,660
extremely important regarding artificial

223
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:49,440
intelligence and big data beyond beyond

224
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,980
Austin storing data to a formal side and

225
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,770
knowledge of the data producer it's

226
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,420
equally important to be able to assume

227
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,010
to ensure that the data are available

228
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,860
that they are not they have not been

229
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,830
gazed and that they are not provide to

230
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,370
serve the strategic interest of only one

231
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,590
of the partners in the coalition

232
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,990
moreover when this data are processed it

233
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:19,650
will algorithm it is also crucial to

234
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:22,589
know who is doing it and what data

235
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,529
it has been trained with an algorithm

236
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:30,120
trained with desert data will inevitably

237
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:32,850
lead to better decision to conclude to

238
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,000
conclude the way we possess more data a

239
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,390
way of answering trust with the military

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,720
coalition which will be one of the main

241
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:45,210
area of works for the Center for the

242
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,210
Terran center of excellence in the

243
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:51,029
future when Boeing's together all the

244
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,370
nation interested in this field this

245
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,880
work revolving about the data and

246
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:00,270
supporters in an its process may ensure

247
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,150
the best transition from system similar

248
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,329
security to a trusted data revolution

249
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,939
thank you for attention

250
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,940
