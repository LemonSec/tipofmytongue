00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,879
Madam President Admirals generals

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,309
excellences they're faithful fans of

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,889
saikhan it is an honor and privilege to

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,129
welcome you to the 11th annual cyclone

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,279
conference here in Tallinn

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:19,140
11 years might sometimes seem like a

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,090
short amount of time relatively those

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,640
well those of us who have children know

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,740
that 11 year old carbon-based life-form

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,130
might not be the most intelligent and

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,439
established being 11 years in cyber

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,829
however dates us back to the pre

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,239
gunpowder era in military terms

14
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,280
throughout those 11 years the research

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,339
staff of the NATO cooperative cyber

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,360
defence centre of excellence has pushed

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,469
the boundaries of governmental and NATO

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,210
thought on cyber we have been raising

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,590
important topics years before the

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,620
Alliance for the member nations were

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,870
comfortable to discuss them already in

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,358
2008 our legal team concluded an

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,289
analysis on the relationship of cyber

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,740
attack and NATO article 5 it took 6 long

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,409
years and only in 2014 the Wales summit

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,630
declaration affirmed cyber defenses part

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,049
of NATO's core task of collective

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,530
defence our centres work on that plaque

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,299
ability of existing international law on

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,450
cyber operations known as the Tallinn

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,820
manual and Tala manual 2o raised heated

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,329
debates both amongst the allies and

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,089
adversaries our our centre has been

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,649
running exercises and studying offensive

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,439
cyber operations for more than five

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,000
years now only at the last year's

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,139
Brussels summit was the Alliance

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,970
comfortable enough to shyly mention

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,000
incorporating voluntary cyber effects

40
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,240
into the operations the current hot

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,049
topics like election meddling

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,899
attribution AI autonomous systems they

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,490
are on our research agenda and will be

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,270
discussed in the coming three days here

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,429
at saikhan while our centres research

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,728
says perhaps well known to you there

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,709
saikhan regulars I would like to briefly

48
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,569
highlight the two exercises that our

49
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,110
Center hosts among

50
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:19,108
many other important activities in our

51
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,959
busy agenda in January we held their

52
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:24,510
fifth iteration of exercise crosswords

53
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,090
the exercise that practices offensive

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,870
cyber operations and incorporating them

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,879
into the kinetic operations in a highly

56
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,180
experimental environment the commander

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,220
had to choose from his toolbox toolbox

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,500
between the available options of cyber

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,829
or kinetic Special Operations tasks and

60
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,939
- in order to achieve these objectives

61
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,730
will we believe that with exercise

62
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,608
crosswords the center has failed a very

63
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,790
important gap in preparing our troops

64
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:58,470
for the modern battlefield

65
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,959
just last month in April we held the

66
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,639
world's largest annual international

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,139
live-fire cyber defence exercise locked

68
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,919
shields 23 teams from our member nations

69
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,109
participated and a total number of

70
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,359
international personnel involved were

71
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,549
exceeded 1,500 people

72
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,519
the exercise was so massive that we

73
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:21,000
received an unexpected compliment on a

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,250
VIP day we hosted several groups of

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,879
high-level visitors one of the group's

76
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,989
was industry executives and an executive

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,129
from one of the top three largest

78
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,650
military defense companies in the world

79
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,418
after he had seen the exercise I asked

80
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,819
him so no one you've seen know when

81
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,819
you've seen it how large do you think

82
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,839
the center is and he said well it sounds

83
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,149
like a trick question you're probably

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,650
much smaller and I think are you less

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:53,310
than thousand people I I said 60 how

86
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,949
about sixty six zero this is how

87
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,400
powerful is the leverage of cooperation

88
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:02,459
the first see NATO CCD corporate CCD CIA

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,829
cooperation our 21 and growing number of

90
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,000
member nations do send us their nation's

91
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,709
best and brightest who work very hard to

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,959
bring you the world-class events like

93
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,840
exercises crosswords Lock shields and

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,659
this saikhan conference but we could not

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,820
do this alone throughout the 11 years

96
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:24,500
our Center has built a community of

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,540
cyber enthusiasts who work together

98
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,780
sometimes voluntarily

99
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,210
just for pizza and t-shirt in order to

100
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,500
advance the cause of cyber awareness

101
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,340
amongst our growing number of

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,340
like-minded in the member nations also

103

106
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,500
partners it is a cooperative team effort

107

amazing we are very much aware of the

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,940
proliferation of cyber conferences this

112
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:09,080
day and era we thank you for choosing

113
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,880
saikhan once again we have already being

114
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,940
mentioned that saikhan has a special

115
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,270
vibe and our center is working very hard

116
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:21,170
to hard to keep that psyche on by alive

117

commitment of our world-class speakers

119
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,960
we do not have budget to pay speaker

120
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,060
fees so all the outstanding experts that

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,690
you will see as our keynotes and

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:40,010
panelists they do it for economic class

123
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,469
tickets to Tallinn and your applause so

124
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:48,170
while we are being cheap please you the

125
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,940
audience don't to prove that we're not

126
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,770
completely stingy I would like to now

127
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,530
reveal what is inside our speaker give

128
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,810
back this year now you saw the Estonian

129
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,030
weather this morning we have several

130
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,610
jokes regarding Estonian weather one of

131
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:06,750
them goes like this so what did you do

132
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:11,400
last summer oh I had to work that day

133
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,200
well last summer the hot Summer 2018 had

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,659
so many sunny days that some local

135
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,960
entrepreneurs launched the organic

136
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,690
Estonian tanning oil set so this this is

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,560
our speaker gift this year hope you see

138
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,890
it saikhan branded our conference dinner

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,110
tomorrow night is in the format of a

140
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,940
beach party but in order to prepare for

141
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,590
the regular Estonian weather it is an

142
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,430
indoor beach so no need for sunscreen

143
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,900
there we could not deliver you the

144
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,050
cyclone without the help and partnership

145
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,669
of our sponsors being in governmental

146
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,200
non-commercial organization our budget

147
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,430
is multiple times lower than you would

148
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,650
guess trust me I know

149
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,100
so this year our diamond sponsors are

150
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:57,390
card time a rising star among Estonian

151
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,919
many cybersecurity startups and the most

152
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,419
promising tech startup from the Seattle

153
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,370
area

154
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:07,200
Microsoft our conference agenda is as

155
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,480
always packed with high-level insightful

156
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,370
keynotes and expert panels divided into

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,050
three areas strategy technology law I

158
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,610
know I'm doing injustice to those superb

159
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,740
events that I don't have time to mention

160
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,600
here but I had to make some choices so I

161
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,510
would like to highlight the crown jewels

162
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,419
amongst the priceless gold I will start

163
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,710
from the very last day Friday right

164
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:34,580
before the closing remarks we'll have a

165
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,859
keynote panel on Estonian digital story

166
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,840
we noticed that most of the visitors to

167
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,120
our center and our events asked many

168
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,010
questions about Estonia and perhaps
