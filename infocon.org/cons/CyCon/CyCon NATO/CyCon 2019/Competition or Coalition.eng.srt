1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,688
all right good morning ladies and

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,589
gentlemen its 9:00 a.m. and

3
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,799
congratulations on making it to the

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,000
hangover panel in the oddly shaped room

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,500
those few of those that have actually

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,389
made it I hope you had a chance to brush

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,549
the sand from between your toes

8
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,830
this morning we are talking about

9
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,630
competition and coalition and we are

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,549
going to be focusing more on the second

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,490
half of that contradiction on the

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,039
coalition side because here at saikhan

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,409
last year former estonian president

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,070
thomas in the Elvis called for a cyber

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,440
NATO as he put it a coalition of liberal

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,440
democracies not bounded or restricted by

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,269
geography in the way NATO is today which

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,579
can better respond to the ubiquity of

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,440
threats and that is what we're going to

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,300
be talking about this morning whether we

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,620
want such a thing whether we can have

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,800
such a thing what it might look like

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,559
what it might do but what struck me was

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,599
the the reciprocity of President Elvis's

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,879
suggestion with what the adversaries say

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,579
because after all one of the key

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,530
advantages of information warfare if you

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,349
read Russian thought leaders is that

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,360
there are no rear areas in information

30
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,490
warfare you can deliver effects to the

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,909
entire depth of enemy territory

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,979
in other words info war is not a North

33
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,549
Atlantic challenge it is a far broader

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,229
problem so why might it be that NATO as

35
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,090
it exists at the moment might not be

36
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,340
able to handle a problem this kind well

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,990
over the years here at saikhan is the

38
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,299
regular attendees will know there have

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,479
been plenty of rehearsals of the

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,140
limitations of NATO it's been criticized

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,299
sometimes unfairly some people say that

42
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,890
NATO cyber policy focuses on the Oh win

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,960
NATO just protecting its own

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,689
organization its own networks and

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,949
nothing further is being done the NATO

46
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,539
looks after itself not the allies as I

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,759
said that sometimes unfair but it is

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,590
true that the pace of operationalizing

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,920
some of the statements and declarations

50
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,860
that NATO has made might have seemed

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,500
impressive in a former era when threats

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,060
were less urgent but may not be quite so

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,860
appropriate now for when the problems

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,660
are immediate and on our faces sometimes

55
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,260
what you call something is actually

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,739
indicative of how you feel about it

57
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,899
and in the case of NATO of course cyber

58
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,799
still comes under the emerging security

59
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,360
challenges division whereas for every

60
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,280
other organization that is risk

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,110
represented at this conference this is a

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,519
challenge which has emerged some time

63
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,620
ago so much so in fact that it is a

64
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,700
mature problem which is fully integrated

65
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,230
in national security and in war fighting

66
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,268
now we heard the head of the emerging

67
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,730
security challenges division dr. Antonio

68
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,290
mr. Olli talk about NATO's responses

69
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,379
that he was positive and upbeat as

70
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,480
people in his position invariably are

71
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,190
and he talked about how NATO was

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,280
responding I gave a list of things that

73
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,019
must be done if you listen closely you

74
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,909
might have recognized that his list of

75
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,920
things that must be done was

76
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,269
considerably longer and more substantive

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,629
than his list of things that are

78
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,129
actually being done at the moment so

79
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:06,590
where does that leave us is it possible

80
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:08,840
that we need an alternative organization

81
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,609
which would be a parallel structure to

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,670
NATO which would reach the parts that

83
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,829
other alliances cannot reach in order to

84
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,869
consider that we've got three extremely

85
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,900
knowledgeable people on the podium with

86
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,669
us today from the far end we have Kim

87
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,799
Hartman who'll be a familiar face to you

88
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:27,260
if you've been attending saikhan

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,019
regularly she's been put she's put in

90
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,569
seven years here with papers presented

91
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,699
always with a very solid foundation of

92
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,858
technical knowledge underpinning her

93
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,780
conclusions in fact I think this is the

94
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:41,090
first time that saikhan has succeeded in

95
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,650
tempting her away from the tech track

96
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,190
and actually joining in with the policy

97
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,010
and strategy so welcome Kim next we have

98
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,169
Martin libecki who has is known to us as

99
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,690
a deep cyber thinker but in fact has a

100
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,099
much broader expertise and experience

101
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,560
that he can bring to bear on cyber

102
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,959
problems he's particularly concerned for

103
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,209
our purposes with the practical national

104
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,400
security implications of information

105
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,230
technology and in particular he's

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,269
written at length about the limitations

107
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,298
of current approaches marseilles good

108
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,180
morning good morning and Marilyn migrant

109
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,070
whose past roles make her probably

110
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,798
uniquely qualified to address this

111
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,238
question because not only has she served

112
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,700
her country as the long-term national

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,919
security adviser to the president she's

114
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,580
also been embedded within NATO in the

115
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,469
belly of the

116
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,109
least in NATO headquarters sono is the

117
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,150
organization from the inside and people

118
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,810
here of course will know her as the most

119
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,340
as the former director of CCD Co II so

120
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,319
from all of these angles she brings

121
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,109
relevant experience to bear on assessing

122
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,789
what might actually be organizationally

123
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,300
feasible in addressing a problem of this

124
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,560
kind the division of labor between the

125
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,000
three because they're coming from such

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
different approaches is going to be

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,500
fairly simple you will have seen from

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,239
the the blurb for this panel that we are

129
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,310
bridging topics well we're also pulling

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,319
together strands from a lot of the other

131
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,860
panels that you have seen over the last

132
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,979
few days we will have Kim first of all

133
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,169
outlining what has happened to date

134
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,240
whether in the period since President

135
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,359
Elvis's repeated call for a cyber NATO

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,009
we see trends emerging in international

137
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,289
practice which looked like that being

138
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,819
implemented whether we see things which

139
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:23,000
might in fact suggests that there is a

140
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:26,300
tacit cyber NATO already emerging even

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,129
without any any formal declaration as

142
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,029
after all we heard bring a general

143
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:33,830
general Blanque talking about the United

144
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,930
States's strategies to mitigate risk

145
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,029
through collaboration and coalition

146
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,139
building and cyber exchange cells and be

147
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,039
classifying to the lowest common

148
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,319
denominator

149
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,270
everything that sounds like an alliance

150
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,339
which is working in parallel with NATO

151
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,810
and there are other examples which Kim

152
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:50,960
will walk us through to see what has

153
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,490
been happening over the last year Martin

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,109
will be discussing the paper that you

155
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,330
may already have seen in the conference

156
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,940
proceedings his proposal for a Baltic

157
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,919
cyber alliance and a practical case

158
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,440
study of how this might work exploring

159
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,508
both the advantages and the challenges

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,460
and of course some of those challenges

161
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,370
as I out party will explain are common

162
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,878
to NATO or any other organization such

163
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,589
as for example thresholds of response

164
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,719
which is a problem that is not going to

165
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,099
go away with the new organization for

166
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,870
dealing with it as my team puts it

167
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,180
somewhere on the spectrum between

168
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,639
mischievous speech and Armageddon every

169
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,629
alliance needs to draw some line between

170
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,250
acceptable and unacceptable practice and

171
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,219
finally metella is going to embellish

172
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,449
all of that with some of the conceptual

173
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,490
challenges and opportunities for an

174
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,959
organization of this kind but for

175
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,380
instance the boundaries of membership

176
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,780
and

177
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,300
of jurisdiction and of responsibility

178
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,429
thinking about cyber operations versus

179
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,590
information operations not a distinction

180
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,780
that our adversaries draw would a new

181
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,179
organization do the same where exactly

182
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,940
do the boundaries of quote cyber unquote

183
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,070
lie and who's in and who's out if it's

184
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,730
an alliance of democracies how do you

185
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,650
set the criteria for bringing people in

186
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,840
each of us because is going to speak for

187
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,330
10 to 15 minutes and we will take all of

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
the the questions at the end we have

189
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,450
three very distinct approaches to the

190
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,400
topic we've got three very distinct

191
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,200
presentational styles you will see every

192
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,049
possible combination of sitting standing

193
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,490
wondering about but the one thing I can

194
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,230
promise you is that there is a common

195
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,960
factor between all of them unusually for

196
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:28,460
saikhan and for this audience today this

197
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,760
morning is a powerpoint free zone so Kim

198
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,950
over to you thank you very much care for

199
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,280
the introduction and good morning

200
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,349
everyone to in this room thank you all

201
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,669
for coming to this very early session I

202
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,310
know there has been beach party

203
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,660
yesterday and a skier pointed out have

204
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,700
been here a couple of times so I know

205
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,910
that these parties before the last day

206
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,520
tend to go on quite long so I'm glad you

207
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,530
all made it and I also want to begin to

208
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,870
give a big thank you to the organizers

209
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,039
of this year's cycle which I believe

210
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,820
have put together an excellent

211
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,080
conference again and this year and for

212
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,830
letting me speak in front of this

213
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,320
audience so those of you who know me

214
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,260
from previous three years know that I do

215
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,870
have a reputation of giving a rather

216
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,969
technical presentation usually and the

217
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,570
technical track so it's my first time

218
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,150
being on a policy track actually but

219
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,590
don't be alarmed as I said you are in

220
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,099
the right room you're on the policy

221
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:31,520
track everything is fine and I will be

222
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:36,530
talking about one of the recent trends

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,030
that we have explored in 2018 and with

224
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,250
that I want to welcome you to this

225
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,539
presentation on the no longer so silent

226
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,539
battle and cyber conflict

227
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,910
so in 2018 what we are observed as

228
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,840
cybersecurity professionals which is

229
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,000
actually something we have been

230
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,620
observing for quite some years is of

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,170
course there have been a numerous amount

232
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,910
of larger and smaller cyber incidents

233
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,579
that were reported and that have been

234
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,089
discussed in the media however compared

235
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,490
to the previous years what we found in

236
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,260
2018 as significant was a significant

237
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,690
and I mean statistically significant

238
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,750
rise of the number of State evolved

239
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,880
incident reports and it's not just that

240
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,860
we suddenly see these kind of reports

241
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,710
popping up everywhere it's actually also

242
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,060
that we see a change in the amount and

243
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,550
quality of information that is being

244
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:31,500
provided so based on the continuously

245
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,390
delivered reports of significant cyber

246
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,590
incidents that are being released by the

247
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,370
center of Strategic and International

248
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:41,250
Studies we were observing that the

249
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,490
portion of official incident reports

250
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,890
that were proactively proactively also

251
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,640
offering background information on the

252
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:55,050
incidents observed made up a total of 45

253
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,790
percent of the reports made in 2018 so

254
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:03,150
speaking in clear numbers that were 51

255
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:06,839
reports that we found in 2018 of these

256
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,959
type of reports compared to AIDS in 2016

257
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,170
so while it's true that there was a

258
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,200
general rise of more reports getting on

259
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,329
than on the net and being discussed even

260
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,590
if you still do to statistics you will

261
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:25,560
still find it's a significant rise so

262
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,770
just in case you wonder what the CSIs

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,030
actually means by a significant attacks

264
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,720
significant attacks are all those that

265
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,970
are targeting governmental defense or

266
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,620
high-tech companies with an economic or

267
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:44,820
with an economic loss of greater than 1

268
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:48,810
million dollars so what I'm going to be

269
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,610
talking about is some of the examples

270
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,599
the most prominent ones that we saw in

271
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,790
2018 but I'm not just gonna be talking

272
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,710
about cyber incidents because this is a

273
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,170
trend that is actually not just

274
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,300
facility in itself in for cyber incident

275
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,110
reporting button for incident reporting

276
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,359
in general which we saw in 2018

277
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,450
so the first one that I'm going to pick

278
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,800
up is not petia ransomware attack and I

279
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,430
find it's very interesting to pick up

280
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,130
because it was actually observed in 2017

281
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,620
by academia and technical professionals

282
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,189
and it was discussed by the public

283
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,710
previously in 2017 but it was not until

284
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,960
early 2018 that official statements were

285
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,740
made by the US authorities linking the

286
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,200
attack to rush to the Russian Federation

287
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,350
so this this claim was later supported

288
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,320
by UK Denmark Canada Australia and New

289
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,930
Zealand and later on supported by

290
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,740
Estonia Latvia the chanyeol Finland and

291
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:52,079
Sweden and this is very interesting to

292
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,730
observe because you actually don't just

293
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:59,670
see that this that the attribution was

294
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,310
being made by god by a government of

295
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,380
other authorities in 2018 but you also

296
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,550
see the first time that this very

297
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,200
coordinated way of reporting on the on

298
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:14,250
the incidents of and of actually

299
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,980
supporting each other's claims so the

300
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:21,090
second incident that was reported that

301
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,330
was very prominent is the opcd hack and

302
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:27,600
they have which was reported by the

303
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,610
Netherlands in autumn 2018 with almost

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,400
simultaneous announcements made by UK

305
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,590
and us so again you have not just the

306
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
attribution and the stating of the

307
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,450
attack being made what you also have

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,650
again this coordinated way of of

309
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,420
attribution by different states and what

310
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,970
was interesting very interesting about

311
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,000
this case from the technical work

312
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,680
technical perspective because this is

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,740
something that technical speakers do

314
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,410
tend to feel is not being done that much

315
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,440
is that the indentions the Indignants

316
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,569
were actually contained quite some

317
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,210
detail descriptions only activities of

318
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,670
the individual GRU officers arrested and

319
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,279
this was including account and domain

320
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,620
names

321
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,139
as well as times and locations of online

322
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,180
activities we were also presented with a

323
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:21,490
couple of pictures of technical devices

324
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:23,800
and informations on them so apart from

325
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,249
these two cyber incidents that were

326
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,930
observed in 2018 the certainly most

327
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,689
prominently known cyber incident

328
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,609
reported and discussed blobel in 2018

329
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,610
must have been the Salsbury attack

330
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,089
so the Salsbury attack what I'm gonna

331
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:45,758
summarize like this is in September 2018

332
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:47,649
the British government disclosed details

333
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,920
on the two suspects and the poisoning of

334
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:53,199
the scribbles what follows was a debate

335
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,259
in the UN Security Council which was

336
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,508
initiated initiated by the UK the led to

337
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:02,709
the release of the statements of leaders

338
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,670
of us France Germany and Canada who are

339
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:08,229
actually backing up

340
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:12,370
Britain's assessments what followed must

341
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:17,589
have been a diplomatic very well very

342
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:20,379
diplomatic case of trying to allow how

343
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,709
to cope with the situation but in the

344
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:25,209
end more than 20 countries subsequent

345
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:27,849
subsequently supported the UK in its

346
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:32,739
allegations and expelled more than 100

347
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:34,269
Russian diplomats among them so why are

348
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,089
we picking on the Salsbury

349
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:38,980
attack example of much is that it

350
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,670
actually showed the trend that we are

351
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:45,220
observing of cooperated and coordinated

352
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,889
state response that utilizes the power

353
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,139
of transparency in two ways so first of

354
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,050
all we saw the International coordinator

355
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:56,410
coordination as demonstrated by the UN

356
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,599
Security Council and secondly we saw her

357
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,389
the power of transparency really hits

358
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,329
the case and made it not just globally

359
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:08,649
known but also gave you a common sense

360
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:10,300
of situational awareness so the UK was

361
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,720
releasing a limited amount of

362
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,819
information on the Status buried case by

363
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,699
which it only disclosed a limited amount

364
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,719
of its capabilities so of course when

365
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:21,910
you are talking about information

366
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,360
sharing this is all always an issue you

367
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,980
are having

368
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,410
is how much information do I want to

369
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,329
share without actually giving too much

370
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,060
information on what my capabilities are

371
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,040
and how I am actually operating but at

372
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,529
the same time by doing that by just

373
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,620
releasing selected and limited amount of

374
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,779
information you yeah the UK was actually

375
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,850
tapping into the enormous power of the

376
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:48,820
media worldwide to join the dots and

377
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:54,160
complete the case so summarizing on the

378
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,290
trend that we saw what changed is first

379
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,709
of all we have the confirmation of

380
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:03,310
attack by States which we have seen in

381
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:06,489
previous years also but then it barely

382
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,680
just were was a state and was made okay

383
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,880
we had an attack we were confirmation

384
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,199
that there were confirmations around

385
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,000
that there is an attack going on or

386
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,250
there was an attack going on mostly it

387
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,320
was after the attack with sometime in

388
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,060
between so it was just saying okay there

389
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,190
has been an attack the second thing that

390
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:26,829
we saw is the significant rise in

391
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:28,180
attribution and we also saw that there

392
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:31,410
is a selective disclosure of

393
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,810
intelligence service information and

394
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:39,910
especially all three of them being done

395
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:42,160
in a coordinated way among others so one

396
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,839
of the questions that has been actually

397
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,949
discussed that a couple of instances

398
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,600
within just this conference is why so

399
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:51,430
and to answer this question one

400
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,140
particular talk did I would like to

401
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,479
point you to if you haven't seen it I

402
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,339
hope you've been there was but a

403
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,220
presented by Jill berm from Tel Aviv

404
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,890
University who presented her research at

405
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,020
cyclone on Wednesday inherit our

406
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,449
coverage or north national strategy

407
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:11,168
during the cyber conflict where she

408
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:14,939
actually investigated how it is an

409
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:17,650
advantage of choosing to be transparent

410
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,669
another aspect that I would like to pick

411
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,630
up which I liked particularly was made

412
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:28,240
by or stated by a bridge or general Jung

413
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,730
which she mentioned that why we want to

414
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,470
be transparent is actually to get a

415
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,740
common situation situational awareness

416
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,559
and to

417
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,870
create this common situation of aerosol

418
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,379
this is really the point that is that I

419
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,330
want to stress is if we want to do this

420
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,070
so this is this is our goal we want to

421
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,620
have a common situation awareness we

422
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,139
have to ask yourself am i getting that

423
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,379
at this point and if not why am I not

424
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:01,570
getting it so to create this we have to

425
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,280
get a constant on the conclusions that

426
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,200
are being drawn and the attributions

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,540
that are being made so what we should

428
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,929
discuss is actually what information

429
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:14,409
must be disclosed what information can I

430
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:18,670
keep to myself in what way do I have to

431
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:22,720
present this and to whom so that in

432
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,640
order to empower me to the or allies to

433
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,770
actually reproduce the conclusions we

434
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,960
are making and not just our allies but

435
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,960
actually also to be thinking about if we

436
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,910
are moving into cyber conflict we don't

437
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,090
just want our allies to be on our side

438
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,730
we actually want to be able to explain

439
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,590
to the public why we are doing this and

440
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,390
why we are acting in this bitten in a

441
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,540
certain way and we don't just have to

442
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,760
think of our public as in the public

443
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,559
living in the countries we are living in

444
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,780
but we also have to think about the

445
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,540
public in those countries that were not

446
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:01,870
that were not or allies so we have to be

447
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:05,190
transparent about this so there may be

448
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,750
absolutely clear on this transparency is

449
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,910
absolutely a good thing not just because

450
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,420
it's one of the key pillars of a liberal

451
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:18,429
and different democratic republics and

452
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:21,550
cyber incident reporting but we need to

453
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:23,710
ensure that we all have a common sense

454
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,120
of the information that we're looking at

455
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,730
and the conclusions that are being drawn

456
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,330
so just taking a quote from last year's

457
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:33,160
icon just to show you how the way of we

458
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,620
are that we are seeing the situation

459
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,110
actually changes from the way your

460
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,439
academic background is I'm going to

461
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:44,139
quote attribution is not a problem so

462
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,170
this is something that last year in the

463
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,210
policy track I believe were almost ahead

464
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,760
and most people were falling with that

465
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,710
and it has been repeated this year and

466
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,980
the law track I sought out in these

467
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,230
fields talk that attribution is not a

468
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,570
problem but if you're looking at the

469
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,210
technical people I remember last year

470
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,070
when I heard that and I was sitting next

471
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,260
to a couple of technical guys and we

472
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,540
were all just like whoa wait a second

473
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,460
yeah attribution is a problem in

474
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,370
technical terms so this is just one

475
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,500
example how different people coming from

476
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,290
different areas have a very different

477
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,690
perspective of what you need to do to

478
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,580
actually feel confident to attribute so

479
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,590
it's a completely different thing if you

480
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,870
want to be confident in attribution from

481
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,510
a policy point of view because you can

482
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,639
just rely on okay this was my ally

483
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,610
stating that and I trust my allies so I

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,710
feel confident of stating that this is

485
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,928
the case as seen as well from a law

486
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,549
perspective you can feel certain if you

487
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:48,660
have a couple of rules that are being

488
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:50,820
applied and and they're alright but from

489
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,679
a technical point of view you what you

490
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,559
really want to look into is the digital

491
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,600
forensics that has been made and we are

492
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,850
still concerned with the final step in

493
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,290
the digital forensic which is actually

494
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,299
the attribution of the route to the real

495
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,040
person that was sitting in front of the

496
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,720
computer but while that is something

497
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,820
where you can actually say okay this was

498
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,280
stated by my Ally or we have intelligent

499
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,740
services available that are showing this

500
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,020
to me and you can trust them that's fine

501
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,000
but you still want to see the digital

502
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,679
forensics being done and that's actually

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,080
something that's but great about the

504
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,059
situation is because digital forensics

505
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,428
is working in a way where you can

506
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,470
actually disclose quite a lot of

507
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,660
information without having to disclose

508
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,390
too much of your capabilities and at the

509
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,910
same time you do not have to touch the

510
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,760
data yeah you get a copy or they get

511
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,650
digit or you can multiply it's thousands

512
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,809
of times and give it to any person

513
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,710
around who feels competent and judging

514
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:48,809
on on the situation so I'm going to

515
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,549
close this with the fault on that I

516
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:53,040
would have really loved to see a

517
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:56,010
discussion on how we should do that what

518
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,550
information we should be sharing and how

519
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,290
we should disclose it and whether or not

520
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,409
we should actually have an institution

521
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:07,080
that is capable of controlling the

522
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,870
information and the attribution that is

523
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,439
being made so thank you very much for

524
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,510
the talk

525
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:24,330
I've enjoyed speaking here and I'm hope

526
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:26,610
C forward to the discussion I'm here to

527
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,129
entertain the notion of a Baltic

528
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,428
cyberspace alliance when I mention this

529
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,500
to an attendee at the Icebreaker she

530
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,840
looked kind of shocked and said you must

531
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,690
be in favor of breaking up NATO did the

532
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,820
Russians pay for your work so let me

533
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,100
start off I'm not in favor of breaking

534
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,950
up NATO I understand the nuclear

535
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,678
umbrella got that an attack on one is an

536
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,980
attack on all got that okay if NATO

537
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,470
finds itself in a kinetic operation and

538
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,120
you need cyberspace operations to

539
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,790
support that kinetic operation

540
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,178
they also come under NATO got that too

541
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,970
but if we're talking about cyberspace

542
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,780
operations outside the context of

543
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,380
context of kinetic warfare is this

544
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:17,010
necessarily best understood as being

545
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,929
part of NATO operations okay so the

546
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,140
Russians definitely didn't pay for this

547
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,700
paper the US government did because an

548
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,890
employee of the US government so I have

549
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,070
to put in my standard caveat these are

550
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,660
my own opinions not representative of

551
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,129
the u.s. government as a whole okay so

552
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,230
those of you who are otherwise worried

553
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,820
can relax let's start with offer the

554
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,490
problem that we're talking about and the

555
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,610
problem as we all recognize is a sharp

556
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,160
and difficult increase in the level of

557
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,409
Russian information warfare of which

558
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,690
cyberspace operations are an important

559
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:50,809
component directed against many

560
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,520
countries but disproportionately

561
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:56,370
directed against countries of the Baltic

562
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,679
region okay there was a problem now when

563
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,510
I proposed a Baltic cyberspace alliance

564
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,030
it's gonna be necessary for me to define

565
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,950
three terms baltic cyberspace and

566
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,470
alliance so let's get started

567
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,929
baltic countries right a lot of

568
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,400
countries touch the baltic Germany is

569
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,110
the one I have in mind right they do

570
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,790
have a Baltic coast

571
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,709
gonna talk about Sweden and Finland

572
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,389
which are neutral countries this makes

573
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,340
actually a difference I'm not

574
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,500
particularly dogmatic about what's in or

575
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,480
what's out technically the Netherlands

576
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,690
in the Norway do not touch the Baltic

577
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,880
they may have a community of interest

578
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,830
France maybe that's not the point the

579
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,440
point is that there is a core of concern

580
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:39,149
in and roughly around that region okay

581
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,290
cyberspace as I pointed out before I

582
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,630
want to make a distinction between

583
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,360
cyberspace within the context of kinetic

584
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,250
conflict and cyberspace outside that

585
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,240
context and I'm talking more or less

586
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,460
outside that context but cyberspace is

587
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,470
many ways a shorthand for the broad

588
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,510
field of information warfare because the

589
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,210
Russian challenge to the West is not

590
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,070
simply in moving ones and zeros there

591
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,309
has been a large electronic warfare

592
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:08,639
component notably the jamming of GPS and

593
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:09,840
the black sea there is as many of you

594
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,549
know much better than I do

595
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,540
a what we could call psychological

596
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:17,760
operations component okay to Russia it's

597
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,559
a broad mix so that when you talk about

598
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,629
cyberspace I want to understand is

599
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,970
somewhat broader definition let me come

600
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,320
to the most difficult word here of all

601
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,870
and that's an alliance

602
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,520
what does exactly Alliance mean I'm

603
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,320
gonna turn this around I'm gonna ask the

604
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,668
question generally speaking most

605
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,678
organizations have to defend their own

606
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,450
systems themselves for a lot of

607
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,760
complicated reasons I don't want to get

608
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,090
into and that leaves the question how

609
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,010
can outside assistance be useful okay

610
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,290
this isn't one of these cases in kinetic

611
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,750
warfare where if you mass forces

612
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,780
together you end up with bigger forces

613
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,000
than the other guy has right there are

614
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,629
no Lanchester laws in the field of

615
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,210
cyberspace so specifically what in fact

616
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,179
can you do in common well it turns out

617
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,160
that in cyberspace there are actions

618
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,350
that can be that are that and I'm an

619
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,660
economist to offer eken economies of

620
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,639
scale that in fact they are more cost

621
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,400
effective to do collectively than they

622
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,990
are doin dividual ii intelligence while

623
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,730
we talk about intelligence sharing

624
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,559
because it's much more efficient to have

625
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,660
people collect various forms of

626
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,520
intelligence and integrated than it does

627
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,130
to have everybody collect all of their

628
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,320
intelligence on all the same stuff okay

629
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,780
forensics is another one whether our

630
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,610
economies of scale because forensics is

631
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,590
incidental you go from basically one

632
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,959
attack to another here if you

633
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,540
concentrate effort you can achieve

634
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,740
economies of scale lessons learned which

635
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,510
is in many ways the flip side of

636
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,400
intelligence what have we learned about

637
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:50,790
cyberspace okay there are many

638
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,460
opportunities for collaboration now if

639
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,680
you extend this global cooperation is

640
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,050
better than then European collaboration

641
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,540
is going to be better than sub-sub

642
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,970
European collaboration but again you

643
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:08,040
deal with what you have now more

644
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,900
controversially is offense right offense

645
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,540
comes in two types one of them can be

646
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,700
called is called persistent engagement

647
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,129
which is basically as you challenge the

648
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,030
cyber forces of another country and the

649
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:24,270
other one can be termed terms can be

650
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:26,460
termed as retaliation or some sort of

651
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,020
response something that lets other folks

652
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,240
know that they cannot attack you with

653
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,100
impunity both of them are relatively

654
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,530
underdeveloped as in many ways as the

655
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,959
entire field of cyber space in general

656
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,450
okay

657
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,350
so let me ask the obvious question why

658
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:46,080
not NATO and here I want to go again go

659
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,300
down two tracks the first track is that

660
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,540
a lot of what is understood as Alliance

661
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,360
defense makes sense more sense in other

662
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,550
media than they do in cyberspace if you

663
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,909
can over generalize and I do that for a

664
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,950
living there are sort of three functions

665
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,260
of external defense one is interposition

666
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,570
right you have something you want to

667
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,940
defend here I add to the forces over

668
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,189
here that keep these guys from

669
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,720
penetrating my lines and getting to you

670
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,880
you know getting to what I want to

671
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,900
protect clearly in cyberspace it doesn't

672
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,080
make a whole lot of sense

673
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,740
another assistance that can be done from

674
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,470
the outside is to disarm the other side

675
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,180
very close would see a notion okay we

676
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,130
really don't know how to disarm

677
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,110
attackers in cyberspace through

678
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,880
offensive action we're beginning to

679
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,280
learn how you can hobble them a little

680
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,040
bit cripple them a little bit cause

681
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,940
delays in them raise their expenses but

682
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,220
we really don't

683
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,470
to disarm people it's not entirely clear

684
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,300
that this is feasible short of kinetic

685
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,200
methods and the third thing is

686
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:52,200
deterrence right an alliance a group of

687
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,750
folks who are pledged to respond to

688
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,450
provocations collectively may form more

689
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,520
of a deterrence okay the turns however

690
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,370
it's kind of problematic and I will get

691
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,800
into that in a minute actually fairly

692
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:07,979
minute that fairly soon when I ask the

693
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,649
question why not NATO not to put too

694
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,930
fine a point on it I'm asking why not

695
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,240
the United States right why can't the

696
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:18,090
United States take on the responsibility

697
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,520
of defending Europe okay couple

698
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,740
geopolitical lessons we have a current

699
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,340
president we also had a past president

700
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,020
both presidents have agreed on certain

701
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,449
themes in their foreign policy one of

702
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,120
them is we are increasingly concerned

703
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,920
about China we are increasingly

704
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,350
concerned about competition across the

705
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,080
Pacific and that necessarily comes in

706
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,850
competition with other forms of other

707
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,560
that necessarily competes with other

708
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,320
forms of competition right this isn't

709
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,560
the Cold War anymore both presidents

710
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,139
have urged Europe to spend more for

711
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,940
their national defense that's not gonna

712
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,580
go away no matter who gets elected or

713
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,520
re-elected in 2020 okay it's the theme

714
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,669
of American foreign policy second issue

715
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,950
is that the United States alliance in

716
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,770
cyberspace has a name and that name is

717
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,440
the five ice right why is that true

718
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,080
because cyberspace operations depends on

719
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,020
intelligence because we do our SIGINT

720
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,290
collectively individually but we group

721
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,910
with the UK with Australia with New

722
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,450
Zealand with Canada only one of those

723
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,730
five countries is European and in fact

724
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,500
there is a greater I don't know this for

725
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,790
a fact but dollars to donuts is a

726
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,800
greater amount of sharing of

727
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,780
intelligence within the five eyes and

728
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,550
there is in the rest of NATO in other

729
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,620
words from a cyberspace perspective

730
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,240
there's already a two-tiered alliance

731
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,689
when it comes to cyberspace operations

732
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,150
and that's undeniable the third issue is

733
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,040
one of thresholds and I will get back to

734
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,830
that again when does the United States

735
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,090
react and for this example I'm going to

736
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,710
make the point that the United States

737
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,870
threshold for

738
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,539
helping allies is a lot higher than it

739
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,360
is for helping itself case in point

740
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:03,570
South Korea South Korea has undergone a

741
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,959
very large set of attacks from North

742
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,879
Korea the cost can be roughly estimated

743
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,750
of all cyber operations in the billions

744
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,610
of dollars has the United States

745
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,740
basically retaliated even talked about

746
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,500
retaliation or responding to the North

747
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,330
Korean attacks on South Korea the answer

748
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,880
is no although there is mutual

749
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,090
assistance between these two countries

750
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,500
however one North Korea attacked Sony

751
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,840
causing damage in the tens of millions

752
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,950
of dollars the United States did react

753
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,649
right because that was an American

754
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:39,299
outfit that they basically activity was

755
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,729
headquarter in the United States that

756
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,679
they attacked and not an allied outfit I

757
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,110
don't think that's gonna be much

758
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,970
different in Europe okay that our

759
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,129
thresholds of responses are going to be

760
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,809
lower a higher excuse me in Europe than

761
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,570
they are in the United States and again

762
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,820
that has to be considered okay so what

763
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,309
are the some of the advantages of taking

764
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,779
a look at a more localized alliance visa

765
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:05,879
vie a globe spanning nato first is you

766
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,070
can get an easier consensus on action

767
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,500
now what do I mean there are three

768
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,990
things you have to ask yourself what

769
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,029
cyberspace activities are actionable

770
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,130
which ones do you want to respond to I

771
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:19,740
had already mentioned thresholds but

772
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,370
there's another one and that is what in

773
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:27,120
the world of information warfare is

774
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:31,739
actionable is propaganda an actionable

775
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:34,350
insult an actionable measure for which

776
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,750
you can take a counter measure well the

777
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,178
United States has a fairly dogmatic I

778
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,270
happen to like it view on freedom of

779
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:45,570
speech European nations not quite as

780
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,520
dogmatic okay if you had to try to get a

781
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,340
consensus between the United States on

782
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,730
one hand Europe on the other hand for

783
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,770
activities that are not zeros and ones

784
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,870
related you might have a problem if you

785
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,970
take more like-minded countries together

786
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,549
you'll have less of a problem so in

787
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,889
terms of thresholds in terms of

788
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:06,360
categorization you're more likely to get

789
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:09,029
a consensus

790
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,070
second issue what level of confidence do

791
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:14,970
you need an attribution in order to take

792
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,799
action against other countries again the

793
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,600
United States and Europe may have

794
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,539
different notions of what's considered

795
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,100
adequate confidence my hunch is that if

796
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,600
you put the Baltic countries together

797
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,610
you are more likely to come with a

798
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,250
consensus I use the word hunch advisedly

799
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:32,820
I have no proof of that but it seems to

800
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,860
be a reasonable expectation finally what

801
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,799
are the appropriate means to use coming

802
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,809
back right what is a legitimate target

803
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,309
what is the legitimate operation what is

804
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:44,428
a legitimate level of collateral damage

805
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:46,470
what kind of care do you take these are

806
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:48,870
things that have to be agreed on and a

807
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,809
smaller group is more likely to come to

808
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,969
an agreement than a larger group okay

809
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:56,309
now don't all these problems exist in

810
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,159
the other spheres and I would argue not

811
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:01,649
nearly to the extent okay if there was

812
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:04,110
dialing back to the Cold War era a

813
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:07,500
Soviet invasion of the inner German

814
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,839
border using a company or using a core

815
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,879
or anything else like that essentially

816
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,830
it's the same that is not true in

817
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,279
cyberspace and I don't want to quote

818
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:20,040
Kiera quoting me so I'll just ask you to

819
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,409
remember what he said okay second

820
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,219
advantage it allows the Europeans to

821
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:28,589
take a leadership role in something okay

822
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,629
that hey that's important from a u.s.

823
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:32,119
perspective that is an important from

824
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:35,580
the u.s. perspective

825
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,320
technically what I used to work I used

826
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,790
to work in OP now in the 1980s and I

827
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,310
noticed the one area that the Europeans

828
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,320
took and it took the lead on was counter

829
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,639
mind warfare which if you think about it

830
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,050
makes a great deal of sense given the

831
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,790
nature of mine warfare right okay um

832
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,770
here I believe I'm pushing on an open

833
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,060
door and I'll give you an example then

834
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,460
I'll have to walk it back a little bit

835
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:00,029
if you take a look at Germany Germany

836
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,710
has a cyber core which constitutes 8

837
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,099
percent of the German armed forces

838
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:08,490
roughly 15,000 people out of 190 right

839
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:11,609
the US has a Cybercom which constitutes

840
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,618
0.4% of the manpower of the u.s. DoD a

841
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,779
20 to 1 difference now if you actually

842
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,910
ask the Germans they'll say hold it it's

843
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,740
not quite like that I got if they have a

844
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,210
lot of things in their version of cyber

845
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,339
or we don't have in our version of

846
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,320
cypher court but it does suggest that at

847
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:27,740
least notionally and in terms of

848
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,050
narrative the Germans have stepped up to

849
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,990
the cyberspace problem similar things

850
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,330
are going on in France this if you had

851
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,009
to ask the Europeans based on their

852
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,020
actions or what an economist would call

853
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,830
revealed preference where they want to

854
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,009
take the lead

855
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:46,049
they probably mentioned cyber so in in

856
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,200
this case I am pushing on an open door

857
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,300
second another advantage Sweden and

858
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,000
Finland these are not NATO countries but

859
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,280
the issue of joining NATO is very hotly

860
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,770
debated one of the problems that the

861
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,980
both countries have is the risk of a

862
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:04,140
neuralgic reaction from Russia Russia

863
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,320
has long memories they fought Finland in

864
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,920
1939 they fought Sweden in the early

865
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:14,250
18th century right and it is fairly easy

866
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,099
for the Russians to paint the Swedes and

867
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,020
the Finns as the jackbooted thugs right

868
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:21,630
makes no sense in this part of the world

869
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,820
you met is it's amazing what can make

870
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,339
sense in Moscow if you really work it ok

871
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,140
cyberspace I cannot guarantee you that

872
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:30,029
it's not going to evoke that reaction I

873
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,118
think I can argue it's less likely to

874
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,800
evoke that reaction ok and an alliance

875
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,869
which in fact includes Sweden and

876
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Finland both of whom have a lot of

877
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,890
assets to bring to the table and

878
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,040
cyberspace is one that it basically is a

879
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:47,040
halfway house to NATO if they look at

880
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,330
the if they think they enjoy and need to

881
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,910
work with their European allies and

882
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:53,098
defence matters they can go one way if

883
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,049
they find out that in fact that doesn't

884
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,720
work it allows them to go the other way

885
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,440
it is it's it's a partial commitment

886
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,330
with much less proportional risk and

887
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,720
finally in terms of advantages is it

888
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:09,299
complicates Russian strategy to have two

889
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,240
groups of opponents rather than one

890
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,280
group of opponents ok and now being an

891
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,169
academic I would be remiss if I didn't

892
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,170
go and talk about the other side the

893
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:22,050
challenges first challenge is anytime

894
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:25,200
you have two alliances working on

895
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,359
similar problems you also you can have a

896
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,129
gap in other words I know how many

897
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,450
baseball fans are here but if the left

898
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,589
fielder in the center field they're both

899
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,930
things the other one's going to get the

900
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:34,730
baseball you have

901
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:40,520
problem okay for those of you don't know

902
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:42,680
baseball will continue so um take a look

903
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,200
at not petia you have the mercy and

904
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,029
Merck effect Maersk dana shipping

905
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,480
company lost hundreds of millions of

906
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:52,490
dollars from not petia merck american

907
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,900
pharmaceutical company lost hundreds of

908
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,450
millions of dollars for not pets yet

909
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,190
right if there were to be a response who

910
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,290
would take the lead well that has to be

911
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,839
coordinated right one more thing that

912
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,599
you have to do second of all is is

913
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,790
there's at least a notional risk of a

914
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,460
cascade in other words when you have two

915
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:15,579
alliances with overlapping membership

916
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:17,839
with non non that look like this

917
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,480
okay you have the possibility that a

918
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,828
conflict with a non Alliance member ends

919
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,230
up being a conflict with the other

920
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,970
Alliance under the circumstances I think

921
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,800
that's highly notional but as an

922
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,629
academic I have to bring that up and

923
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,430
finally more practically there's a

924
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,230
boundary between tactical cyberspace

925
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,990
operations and strategic cyberspace

926
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,220
operations just when you think as an

927
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,140
academic that you've got these

928
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,819
categories clean somebody comes off with

929
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,868
an example that doesn't look like one or

930
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:46,640
doesn't look like the other okay now so

931
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:48,710
here it is I'm an American

932
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,839
telling Europeans what to do you can

933
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,280
take that with a grain of salt but I did

934
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:58,869
want to introduce the idea into the

935
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:03,950
dialogue Thank You Marcia really much

936
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:08,150
I'll try to respond and react to to what

937
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:09,980
said before and as a European perhaps

938
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:14,720
also are you for the case of the

939
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:16,880
leadership taken and of the leadership

940
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,430
that that can or has been taken as

941
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,750
various formats on this side of the

942
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,618
Atlantic

943
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:27,049
first of all let me address back the

944
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,170
original idea that you care brought out

945
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:32,240
that that has sort of like is we haven't

946
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,589
mentioned like the the the previous

947
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,529
speakers haven't mentioned but but you

948
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:38,960
did have like the the idea put forward

949
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:43,930
by president Dilma's over a sort of

950
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,470
cybernator although it was strongly

951
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,470
circulated it

952
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:52,759
his last year's psych on opening speech

953
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:55,459
I should recall as as a historian at

954
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,880
heart that actually if we go back to the

955
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,720
facts the idea originally came from his

956
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,680
speech as saikhan in 2016 so three years

957
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,569
ago from today in 2016 when he put put

958
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,750
forward the idea for the first time as

959
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:14,240
you sit here calling for not NATO but a

960
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:17,180
club of rule of law based democratic

961
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,700
countries that could could certify

962
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,359
software and hardware where membership

963
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:26,169
is a privilege but also comes with some

964
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:32,740
carries benefits to those who join and

965
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:35,690
and rather than starting to write a way

966
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,118
measure the pluses and minuses of that

967
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,660
idea let's measure the value of that

968
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,950
idea in in that time I think back in

969
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,730
2016

970
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:50,689
ill was underlined the importance of to

971
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:54,190
think about International Cooperation

972
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:57,260
and coalition among nations on cyber

973
00:40:54,190 --> 00:41:01,430
outside of NATO because there wasn't

974
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:05,690
much of that going on today we are in a

975
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:11,359
different setting as Kim told us we've

976
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:13,790
seen various attributions in late 2017

977
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,950
starting with wanna cry attribution but

978
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:21,200
also as you as you rightly said the

979
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:22,730
north Patriot rebuke Satan and and all

980
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,240
the other attributions that we've seen

981
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:31,069
later last year we've seen various

982
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:36,709
different coalition's of of forming on

983
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:37,490
cyber and from my own first-hand

984
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:42,430
experience

985
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:44,569
I remember how how the topic of of

986
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,140
cybersecurity and cyber policy has

987
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:50,470
evolved I mean back in September 2007

988
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:54,379
when I assumed the role of director of

989
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:56,899
heading the NATO CCD Co II it was very

990
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,880
complicated to draft a press statement

991
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,369
on one of the

992
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,859
red against red exercises that this

993
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:06,019
Center does the cross walls I mean we

994
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:08,660
were struggling to find words how to

995
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:12,950
explain the outer world about cross

996
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:16,430
walls exercise because it really is

997
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:21,019
about the offensive skills but back in

998
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:23,058
in 2017 it didn't go down very well and

999
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:25,129
in order to avoid conflict with NATO

1000
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:30,559
headquarters we were talking about

1001
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:33,319
active response active defense which is

1002
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:37,910
also all true but we just didn't call

1003
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:41,859
the spade a spade by a year later

1004
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:45,578
basically by 2018 we have the French

1005
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:48,230
defense minister in a large cyber

1006
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:50,869
conference in little very openly

1007
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:53,230
announced the French offensive cyber

1008
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:56,240
doctrine I mean we are much more

1009
00:42:53,230 --> 00:43:01,119
comfortable about talking it NATO itself

1010
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,649
since its summit last summer in Brussels

1011
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,710
has become more comfortable about

1012
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:10,160
offensive when a number of allies

1013
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:12,559
announced their sovereign effects on

1014
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,368
cyber basically talking about the

1015
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:20,180
offensive effects more nations joined up

1016
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:23,240
have joined out but later the NATO

1017
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,669
section last week in the in the London

1018
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,240
cyber pledge conference was pretty open

1019
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:35,210
about NATO becoming more stronger in its

1020
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:39,470
posture against cyber attacks so I think

1021
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:43,910
when I take a criticism when you say

1022
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:46,910
that the NATO ASG has a longer list of

1023
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:50,450
things to do in his to-do list and then

1024
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,788
in the list of accomplished things yet

1025
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:56,569
that's somewhat normal I guess it's also

1026
00:43:52,789 --> 00:44:00,619
a reflexive vision and by the way and

1027
00:43:56,569 --> 00:44:02,839
care when you say that the emerging

1028
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:06,680
security challenges division is are

1029
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:09,619
somewhat reflects our redundancy and

1030
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,618
it's in its title then I hope I'm not

1031
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,819
constantly sure and sharing a secrets

1032
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:19,039
but but there are plans to rename it to

1033
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:22,269
asymmetric threats Department so I guess

1034
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:30,829
it's it's also the labeling is is is

1035
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:35,508
being updated so while thinking of a

1036
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:36,230
need for a localized sort of cyber

1037
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:41,809
Alliance

1038
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:45,140
I I would raise doubts about costing

1039
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:47,690
NATO away it's like saying that your

1040
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,379
relationship doesn't work and and rather

1041
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:53,390
than then making it making it better you

1042
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,710
you expect someone new coming along and

1043
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:00,920
that's that then working working better

1044
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:05,299
NATO NATO's decision-making procedure

1045
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,549
surely is not perfect but I think that

1046
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:10,519
is being recognized and when we see for

1047
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:14,990
example the importance that is being

1048
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:18,258
given to exercises both at strategic and

1049
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,919
operational level in NATO on cyber I'm

1050
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:22,099
impressed

1051
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,799
I mean regularly at the CMX the crisis

1052
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:28,130
management exercises over the past four

1053
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:35,509
years cyber has played a very important

1054
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:37,809
role NATO is recognizing well when when

1055
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:43,250
speaking of like standing against Russia

1056
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:46,940
you mentioned Russia using GPS jamming

1057
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:49,640
in the Black Sea which raises questions

1058
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:54,109
to me about the need to focus on the

1059
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:58,269
Baltic exclusively because I agree we've

1060
00:45:54,109 --> 00:46:02,089
seen that in the Black Sea we've seen

1061
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:07,008
Russia's attacks to a large extent being

1062
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:08,750
directly towards Ukraine the electronic

1063
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:12,230
warfare jamming but also election

1064
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:17,690
interference we've seen and read reports

1065
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:20,359
of Russia jamming the GPS back in the

1066
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:25,880
hi north during the Trident juncture

1067
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:28,250
exercise so the question of of the need

1068
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,540
to build a regional cyber alliance so

1069
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:35,599
that we'd be better because this is

1070
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:39,079
where Russia's attacks are targeted I'm

1071
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:42,490
not entirely sure as long as you leave

1072
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:45,500
Ukraine out for example and with

1073
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:50,540
election interference going on all the

1074
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:56,900
way from us to to France the question

1075
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:59,569
really is I think whether we can single

1076
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:04,130
out two specific geographical region

1077
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:07,308
that is being targeted so and last but

1078
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:09,470
not least speaking of of NATO and the

1079
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:14,450
geographical limits I would like to

1080
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:16,160
underline the value of the CCDC OE the

1081
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,649
nato corporate cyber defence centre of

1082
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,868
excellence one of the 25 I think NATO

1083
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,559
centres of excellence which in itself I

1084
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:29,839
think is a model of a novel approach to

1085
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:31,730
to including members beyond the northern

1086
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,599
Atlantic Alliance itself

1087
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:38,630
I mean CCDC OE being a nato center of

1088
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:42,530
excellence still has Sweden Finland and

1089
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:44,839
Austria as its member I think into two

1090
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,670
weeks there will be a forum or

1091
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:48,349
additional NATO members joining which

1092
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,650
which makes the membership in this

1093
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:54,799
center covering almost all of NATO

1094
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:58,339
alliance our allies but in addition we

1095
00:47:54,799 --> 00:48:01,130
have Japan and Australia that are

1096
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:05,779
intended to join very soon and I'm sure

1097
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:11,930
if New Zealand is interested that door

1098
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:18,559
would not be closed so I see the

1099
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:20,509
flexibility in both as a platform for

1100
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,619
nations for multi tier nations coming

1101
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:27,980
together existing already in NATO or

1102
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:30,559
within the NATO framework surely yes I

1103
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,280
mean NATO is a multi tier Alliance you

1104
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,340
have some

1105
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,410
allies who are stronger in some

1106
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:42,140
capabilities and and and that is visible

1107
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:43,819
in in the same voluntary list of NATO

1108
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:49,129
members who have come up with their

1109
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:52,720
offensive effects UK us Netherlands

1110
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:55,220
Denmark Estonia no no way

1111
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,069
Germany France and Lithuania maybe I

1112
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,770
hope I'm not leaving anybody else so but

1113
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:04,250
the very value of NATO I think is to tie

1114
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:09,530
us together with its European allies and

1115
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:11,570
I think when we list of reasons why it

1116
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:15,230
is growingly difficult

1117
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:21,370
we shouldn't cost the baby out with

1118
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:26,450
water but but rather try to work on this

1119
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:30,589
connection we're making this link or

1120
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:33,919
making this relationship better for for

1121
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:38,390
how better we can now moving on to from

1122
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,770
NATO to to an area that where the

1123
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:44,960
European nations could take leadership

1124
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:48,410
I'd like to talk about EU I think this

1125
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,060
is a you is a is a place where European

1126
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,089
nations definitely have taken leadership

1127
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:56,210
I think Yeoh is a is a wonderful example

1128
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:58,400
of recognizing that cyber threats and

1129
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:01,250
the need to build resilience against

1130
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,520
cyber threats does not is not limited to

1131
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:08,720
military a set of capabilities only but

1132
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:13,840
you need to work on bringing the weakest

1133
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:17,600
member up to the level and to impose

1134
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:20,630
legislative requirements on the member

1135
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,569
states both governance structures as

1136
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:26,690
well as private sector as well as the

1137
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:29,390
critical information infrastructure so

1138
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:31,310
that to get them to the level and I'm

1139
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:34,129
thinking of the EU network information

1140
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:38,060
security directive which which has done

1141
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:40,670
that which has required Member States to

1142
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,310
adopt national strategy on security of

1143
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,610
network and information systems that has

1144
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,290
included

1145
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:50,590
to ensure high levels of security in

1146
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:55,360
critical sectors and so on I'm also

1147
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:58,170
thinking of the EU directive on general

1148
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:02,320
data protection regulation while

1149
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:07,200
originally US has strongly criticized it

1150
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:10,510
I think I'm hearing a lot of nodding

1151
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,240
agreements that this is an example that

1152
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:18,340
is actually worthwhile to follow and I

1153
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:22,990
think a European Union by adopting this

1154
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:26,380
regulation that clearly applies just for

1155
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:29,200
the EU members but this is very useful

1156
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:32,260
they buy this they create a useful set

1157
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,430
of benchmarks that can serve as an

1158
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:38,080
example for globally because ultimately

1159
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:43,210
this applies for anybody who who does

1160
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:50,069
trade with EU EU Member States finally

1161
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:54,090
on the UN front I think there are

1162
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:59,020
definitely more than not just two

1163
00:51:54,090 --> 00:52:01,390
different frameworks that Oval position

1164
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:06,190
to Russia but but much more are

1165
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:09,370
appearing the UN is doubling its work on

1166
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,380
cyber by announcing back in November

1167
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:15,670
both the open-ended working group as

1168
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:19,780
well as the which which is an initiative

1169
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:21,040
proposed by Russia and by a continuing

1170
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,430
work on the group of governmental

1171
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:29,230
experts proposal put forward by the US

1172
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:33,940
and I missed the panel but I'm sure

1173
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:37,090
Hayley dear ma yesterday was vocal and

1174
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:41,460
clear about the work that is going to be

1175
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:45,280
undertaken within these these formers

1176
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:49,510
last but not least when speaking of the

1177
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:53,800
role of nations and posts opportunities

1178
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:56,170
and limits of coalition building and

1179
00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:00,520
also speaking of the president's

1180
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:06,910
initiative in inka in in saikhan I would

1181
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:10,509
like to echo one of the best opening

1182
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:14,470
speeches - saikhan by President Carter

1183
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:19,750
light yesterday two days ago when where

1184
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:22,089
she where she announced the importance

1185
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,820
of states themselves taking the

1186
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,640
responsibility of explaining where they

1187
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:31,540
stand on their understanding of the

1188
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,339
application of international law Estonia

1189
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:37,000
is not the first one doing it the UK

1190
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:40,300
general prosecutor has given a speech

1191
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,240
that is widely quoted and referred to

1192
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:47,860
back in the Chatham House in May last

1193
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:52,120
year - yeah last year France has been

1194
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:54,220
very good at at laying out clearly on

1195
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,549
the McCrone administration of where they

1196
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:59,890
stand at different cyber related issues

1197
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:02,550
the thresholds they've listed the

1198
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:06,400
thresholds in their cyber white paper

1199
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:08,590
and their offensive strategy and and now

1200
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,110
Estonia and the president very clearly

1201
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:16,030
voiced the position adopted by the

1202
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:19,480
government so summing up I think we are

1203
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:22,210
over the course of the last three four

1204
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,750
years we are seeing a multitude of

1205
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:28,690
different coalition's and formulations

1206
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:32,170
of among the like-minded nations coming

1207
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:38,490
up and I think we should use the

1208
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:41,320
existing alliances to their best which

1209
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:45,459
doesn't mean that we have to be limited

1210
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:50,460
by them of course and and attribution of

1211
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:52,510
not petia by five eyes members but also

1212
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,300
additionally a number of countries and

1213
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:58,570
and I'm sure this the list of

1214
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:00,940
attributions attributing will not stop

1215
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:03,550
there shows that this is possible that

1216
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,980
nations can come together that trust

1217
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:10,109
indeed is is

1218
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:13,010
but but I'm I remain skeptical whether

1219
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:16,680
we need necessarily to set up new

1220
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:19,530
organizations in hoping to improve that

1221
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,930
trust or rather work on the existing

1222
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:25,619
formats and try to make the

1223
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,060
relationships work so ladies and

1224
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:29,640
gentlemen as promised three very

1225
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,109
distinct takes on the one problem and I

1226
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,509
hope you've got the impression of a very

1227
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:35,609
rapidly evolving situation not only

1228
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:38,100
within NATO itself as Marilee has

1229
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:40,770
explained but also all of these ad-hoc

1230
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,540
coalition's ad-hoc agreements forming

1231
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,090
between coalition's of the Willing and

1232
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:48,540
commonalities of interest in response to

1233
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:51,359
specific problems now it's true as

1234
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,609
martin says that a key requirement for

1235
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,259
that is consensus and in particular

1236
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:58,140
agreements on tricky issues like

1237
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,880
attribution so you do need to have a

1238
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,920
group of countries that will actually

1239
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,140
agree between themselves to start with

1240
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,940
and it's true that a shared threat

1241
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,470
perception as you have for example in

1242
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,390
this region would be a key driver for

1243
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,759
that but then at the same time we've

1244
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,770
also heard examples of how that

1245
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,290
consensus need not necessarily be

1246
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,359
limited by geography Martin gave the

1247
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,580
example of the five eyes of which only

1248
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:23,910
one member is actually in Europe for the

1249
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:28,319
time being and we also heard about CCDC

1250
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:30,180
we now embracing Australia Kim you may

1251
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,530
have seen in her paper in the

1252
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:34,140
Proceedings gave a number of other

1253
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:36,390
examples of coordination and shared

1254
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:39,990
transparency including also for example

1255
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:42,810
Australia why would we not seek to a

1256
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,790
broaden that Network further inviting

1257
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:46,950
into CCDs he said New Zealand or for

1258
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,359
example Singapore there are some things

1259
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,640
which do actually transcend the

1260
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:54,080
geographical barriers but at the same

1261
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,850
time we've also seen organizations

1262
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:00,540
emerging to meet similar challenges in

1263
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:01,890
other domains visit along side and in

1264
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,140
parallel with NATO you have for example

1265
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:06,629
the formation of the joint expeditionary

1266
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:09,150
force which would seem to duplicate the

1267
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:12,090
functions of NATO in some ways and yet

1268
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:13,740
has been set up to again reach the reach

1269
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,330
the parts that other alliances cannot

1270
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,399
reach it's a Coalition of the Willing

1271
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,808
again it's a consensus of opinion it's

1272
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,769
northern European

1273
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:24,210
including those who are not in NATO

1274
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:27,149
joining together to meet a problem and

1275
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:29,730
fill a gap and joint expeditionary force

1276
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:32,400
currently exercising off Denmark heading

1277
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,740
this way in a few weeks from now you

1278
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,190
also have for example another European

1279
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:41,339
led initiative that was disclosed just

1280
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:44,099
last week zinc network led and financed

1281
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:46,410
by the UK bringing together communities

1282
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,000
of interest across Europe in the counter

1283
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,129
disinformation and counter influence

1284
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,039
space including cyber enabled influence

1285
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:55,500
so these things are happening as we

1286
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,779
speak and the key issue of whether the

1287
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,690
member states in these organisations are

1288
00:57:57,779 --> 00:58:02,869
but members of NATO or not has as much

1289
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:05,519
and suggested they would be in sidelined

1290
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:07,170
Sweden and Finland joining the Gentoo

1291
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,598
Expeditionary Force with very little

1292
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:11,970
controversy except domestically and no

1293
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,829
visible respect from Russia so I agree

1294
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,868
with the thesis that yes this is an area

1295
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:18,720
in which you can extend that cooperation

1296
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:20,160
to bring in other country that with a

1297
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,890
commonality of interest without

1298
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,660
necessarily encountering all of the the

1299
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,759
Russia problems that are always pointed

1300
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,089
out as a problem for enlarging NATO

1301
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:32,250
itself so put it all together and you

1302
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:35,549
come back to Merrill is final and really

1303
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:38,400
important question if we are seeking to

1304
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:40,470
fulfil get perceived gaps in capability

1305
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,289
or in willingness by NATO do we actually

1306
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:46,169
necessarily need to have a parallel

1307
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:48,210
structure or a new organisation or is

1308
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:50,519
the trend that we see developing at the

1309
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:53,099
moment where countries come together for

1310
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:55,649
specific topics of interest because they

1311
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,900
already have shared interests shared

1312
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:59,519
consensus a shared view on the nature of

1313
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,220
the world and how it should work and how

1314
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,899
you deal with your adversaries I'll

1315
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,970
leave that question open for any of the

1316
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:09,869
panelists do to address if they wish to

1317
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:11,730
straight away and if not we will take

1318
00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:17,099
questions from the audience well I would

1319
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:21,599
actually do address that but quickly so

1320
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:25,079
I actually feel that the already shared

1321
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:29,519
consensus as you were just saying might

1322
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:32,310
actually be a problem so it's not a

1323
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,830
problem from within but it may be

1324
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:36,779
a problem from how people who are not

1325
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:40,080
within this association or who are not

1326
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:42,600
within the Alliance may perceive the

1327
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,700
judgment mate and that's exactly the

1328
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:48,569
point that I was trying to make to make

1329
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:51,419
earlier before losing my voice that I do

1330
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:54,090
believe wouldn't it be great to have an

1331
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:56,970
organization that is internationally

1332
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:59,970
accept accepted and respected at least

1333
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:03,509
in terms of their competency to make a

1334
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:05,850
judgement on cyber incidents going on so

1335
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,250
you can at least have the base to say

1336
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:11,160
okay this is what actually was happening

1337
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:13,710
this is what what we looked at not just

1338
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,180
from a political or military operation

1339
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,420
point of view but also from a technical

1340
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:21,330
point of view and then on top of that

1341
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:25,710
make decisions so wouldn't it be great

1342
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:30,240
to have such an organization as the opie

1343
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:32,880
CV is for chemical weapons or the IAEA

1344
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:38,790
is for vast destruction weapons for

1345
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:41,130
cyberspace because I believe it's safe

1346
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:43,470
to say that cyberspace operations do

1347
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:46,800
have the potential of being mass

1348
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:50,129
destruction weapons so I do believe that

1349
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,960
we do need to get a global consent on

1350
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,480
the actions that have been taken and

1351
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:58,190
what we have been seeing and we have to

1352
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,840
be safe about what we are claiming and

1353
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:03,240
it has to be transparent why we're

1354
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,480
claiming what we do so even if you have

1355
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,740
experts within this this allows

1356
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:11,460
potential alliance that I'm thinking of

1357
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:15,240
in my in my head so even if you have

1358
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:18,000
within those experts that do not comply

1359
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,439
with the overall judgment you would

1360
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,010
still from a technical point of view

1361
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,890
would you would still have of course the

1362
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:28,470
common sense within the Alliance and

1363
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:32,629
then of course you could also always ask

1364
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:35,759
why are you not confine what exactly is

1365
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:38,130
where where in the chain of evidence do

1366
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,410
you see the lack can you can you

1367
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:43,260
actually back that up and that's that's

1368
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:45,020
the big point because by doing that you

1369
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,450
are taking away

1370
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:50,060
the advantage that actually I missed the

1371
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:53,029
talk unfortunately that but it is a

1372
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:55,450
concern I was raised that some countries

1373
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:58,160
may actually want to be attributed

1374
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,960
because by that you can actually tap

1375
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,560
into information warfare and you can

1376
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,630
actually get all of this all of all the

1377
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,369
people talking about your capabilities

1378
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:11,330
and what you what you're doing and you

1379
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:13,190
can actually hang on to that so you

1380
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,650
don't want to open that door you want to

1381
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:17,530
close it so by actually having such an

1382
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:20,240
institution wouldn't you be able to

1383
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:22,520
directly say ok you have you have your

1384
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,350
voice you can't speak you can say why

1385
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:28,280
you don't believe the evidence that was

1386
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:30,319
that has been publicly announced where

1387
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,980
is the problem and if you don't have

1388
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:36,230
can't if you can't back up then maybe

1389
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,760
you shouldn't say anything so Kim you

1390
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:41,060
support the initiative for a shared

1391
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,730
Center where you can present attribution

1392
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,500
data and and open it for assessment by

1393
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,690
by other countries and achieve some kind

1394
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,820
of consensus do you also support the

1395
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,950
other implied function of if we call it

1396
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:53,720
a cyber NATO which is of actually doing

1397
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:55,549
something about it or would simply be

1398
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,169
the kind of attribution Center that

1399
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,780
we've we've heard proposed from time to

1400
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:02,840
time where it's icon so what you're

1401
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:05,840
asking if I may rephrase that is whether

1402
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,520
I would think that this Center or this

1403
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,600
organization or whatever you would call

1404
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:15,890
it would be capable of actually taking

1405
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:19,009
countermeasures yes I would I think I

1406
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:22,839
think they would because you would have

1407
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:26,359
what what I always feel is a problem is

1408
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:29,660
to actually get the common the common

1409
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:31,640
situational awareness for everyone

1410
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,859
to be transparent and to be understood

1411
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:36,109
and if you support it and if you have

1412
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:40,970
that basis I think you can much more

1413
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:41,810
easily move you take actions so ladies

1414
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:44,509
and gentlemen there you have it a

1415
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,430
concrete proposal for a communion a

1416
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,710
community which is based on attribution

1417
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:51,049
as the basis for taking action we have

1418
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,760
26 minutes precisely remaining for

1419
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:54,950
questions from the audience I would

1420
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,440
suggest please if you could wait for the

1421
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:58,609
microphone introduce yourselves if

1422
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,289
applicable say

1423
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:02,839
panel member you actually want to direct

1424
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:04,460
the question to and we will take either

1425
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,890
one or two or three questions at a time

1426
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:09,170
depending on on how the time goes so who

1427
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:15,890
would like to be first Chuck Berry at

1428
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:22,730
the back Chuck if you could wave for the

1429
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:24,140
microphone thank you hi Chuck Berry at -

1430
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:26,420
defense University thank you Carrie

1431
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,879
thanks for three great presentations I

1432
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:32,299
don't think we should be fearful of new

1433
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:35,599
organizational structures but I'm

1434
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:39,170
reminded a saying the air force used if

1435
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,640
you're a wing walker you should not let

1436
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,259
go of something solid that you're

1437
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,499
holding on to until you have something

1438
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:48,470
else solid to hold on to or you'll fall

1439
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:52,640
off so in terms of creating a new

1440
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:55,730
organization be cautious about looking

1441
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,499
at competing organizations and I'd look

1442
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,599
back to see what NATO is already doing

1443
01:04:57,499 --> 01:05:03,890
in terms of framework nation concepts

1444
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:07,489
that exist already in logistics and in

1445
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:11,450
in combat capabilities for example f-16

1446
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:13,940
users or the Belgium Netherlands navies

1447
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:16,399
and so forth we've got cooperations like

1448
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:19,190
this the trouble with cyber it seems to

1449
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:23,650
me and I'd ask Martin maybe to address

1450
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:26,599
this is that it's a domain it's not a

1451
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:29,690
discrete capability within a domain we

1452
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:31,400
have in NATO LAN component command an

1453
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:35,269
air component command and a maritime

1454
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,940
component command maybe we need a cyber

1455
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:40,129
component command that might build along

1456
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,859
the lines of the saath headquarters at

1457
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:47,180
shape that grew out of us shop soft

1458
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:49,910
Coordination Center down in Germany some

1459
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:53,239
years ago and maybe all the all the NATO

1460
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:55,700
members who have cyber commands would be

1461
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:58,430
welcome to join this voluntarily and pay

1462
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,129
to be part of that outside the command

1463
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:03,230
structure initially and that way you'd

1464
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:06,200
have that capability the problem with

1465
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:08,029
this general or Admiral Nelson said the

1466
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,339
other day is that this limits is to just

1467
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:12,559
offending its own networks and we

1468
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:15,439
and when we worked on the Alliance

1469
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:18,009
strategic concept in 2010 we realize

1470
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:20,209
it's not just article 5 but it's also

1471
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:22,039
crisis response and cooperative

1472
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,169
engagement right so we have three

1473
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:27,049
missions three tasks of the Alliance and

1474
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:29,989
that command needs to extend out now to

1475
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:33,650
defend not just NATO networks anymore

1476
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:37,219
but defend that the the cyber territory

1477
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:39,829
of NATO members so maybe we could look

1478
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:42,439
at that and maybe the attribution Center

1479
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:45,559
is a way to look I don't think we need

1480
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:47,328
100% attribution it's you know

1481
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,849
reasonable doubt in some countries

1482
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:51,949
there's different there's different we

1483
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:55,849
just went through cm x 19 and we

1484
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:59,989
couldn't reach article 5 in cyber but

1485
01:06:55,849 --> 01:07:02,029
but but you know you can limit who's who

1486
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:04,069
are likely culprits and come up with a

1487
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:07,489
reasonable decision so maybe we could

1488
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:10,308
comment on this and and Merlot I you

1489
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:12,349
know maybe the EU NATO collaboration is

1490
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:14,509
right there EDA there's a lot of things

1491
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:15,890
that can be going on there well let's

1492
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:17,420
pluck the attribution issue for the

1493
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:19,308
moment because after all we have decades

1494
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,959
of conversations already behind us on

1495
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:23,179
the difference between attribution in

1496
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,678
the sense of forensic trails and

1497
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:27,019
attribution in the sense of pointing a

1498
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:28,069
finger so leaving that one aside for the

1499
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:29,269
moment Martin did you want to tackle

1500
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:30,920
that and maybe medal of you have some

1501
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:33,709
yeah I I feel like we're having a fierce

1502
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:35,900
debate between the notion that the

1503
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:37,489
centrality of note of NATO does not

1504
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:41,029
preclude alternative alliance

1505
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:42,349
arrangements and the other point of view

1506
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:44,539
that the existence of alternative

1507
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:49,339
alliance arrangements does not preclude

1508
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:53,769
the centrality of NATO and short and

1509
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:58,069
sweet I agree but absolutely on that but

1510
01:07:53,769 --> 01:08:00,439
mmm when talking about what NATO is or

1511
01:07:58,069 --> 01:08:03,769
isn't it's important to recognize what's

1512
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:05,839
already done so great suggestion but

1513
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:07,269
there already is a cyber operations

1514
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,779
center being set up

1515
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:14,868
last year within NATO command structure

1516
01:08:10,779 --> 01:08:17,509
within the shape with exactly the roles

1517
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:21,339
that it sits in the process of being set

1518
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:23,200
up but yes they assume role for

1519
01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:26,680
including cyber arena

1520
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:31,559
planning for NATO and they have the role

1521
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:35,650
to insert cyber into into exercises

1522
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:38,920
Sir Martin make a distinction here an

1523
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:41,349
alliance and a coalition are two very

1524
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,840
separate creatures an alliance is a

1525
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:45,310
family people do things they don't want

1526
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,529
to do for the purpose of keeping the

1527
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:50,050
family together a coalition is like a

1528
01:08:47,529 --> 01:08:52,120
pickup basketball team it's convenient

1529
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,950
for all the members but it's the

1530
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:56,950
strength of its membership is a function

1531
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:58,450
of its convenience I'm gonna have to

1532
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:02,349
launch into cricket metaphors rolling

1533
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:06,069
over the CEO can itself is is actually

1534
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:07,540
one of the things with for which unfair

1535
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:09,309
criticism has been leveled at NATO

1536
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,510
because yes something is being done but

1537
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:13,000
then you look at the data for full

1538
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:15,460
operational capability of the saikhan

1539
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,750
it's 2023 it's well into the next decade

1540
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,990
which some people think is a reflection

1541
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:21,910
of again a lack of urgency within NATO

1542
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:24,609
but as I said that is an unfair

1543
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:27,040
criticism now quick admin note everybody

1544
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:28,269
that's hovering at the back I know some

1545
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,470
of you are very comfortable hovering at

1546
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:31,120
the back but there are plenty of seats

1547
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:33,610
down at the front if you do want to take

1548
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,050
the weight off we had a lot of firm of

1549
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:37,719
hands from this part of the room who

1550
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:42,820
else would like to put a question in sir

1551
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:46,090
in blue sweater ash differences on -

1552
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:47,979
from DTH sewage and former and I to

1553
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:50,529
working in round Europe so thanks Martin

1554
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:51,459
I have a question for you in terms of

1555
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:53,950
your alliance

1556
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:56,470
why would countries join a

1557
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:59,019
domain-specific alliance that would

1558
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:01,600
expose them to dependencies and security

1559
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,550
threats elsewhere do you envision your

1560
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,260
alliance to work on the dictum what

1561
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:08,350
happens in cyberspace stays in

1562
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:10,870
cyberspace or how should it work because

1563
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,730
because it's it's looks very complicated

1564
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,860
for example if Germany and Poland are in

1565
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:18,009
this alliance what if the Russians run

1566
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:19,750
an OP against Poland does this interfere

1567
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,370
in Germans position or North stream for

1568
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:24,040
example so you have all these spillover

1569
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:26,880
effects otherwise would be great to get

1570
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,880
you common thanks

1571
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:33,070
you had several threads you-you-you put

1572
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:39,280
down so many threads of thought that I

1573
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:43,058
think I got some of them tangled in such

1574
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,489
an alliance under a situation a cyber

1575
01:10:43,059 --> 01:10:47,739
operation carryout against Poland would

1576
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:50,860
be treated by Germany as if it was

1577
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:52,509
carried out against Germany okay is that

1578
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,489
going to get in the way of relations

1579
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:56,469
between Germany and Austria for instance

1580
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:58,780
well that would be true in in any other

1581
01:10:56,469 --> 01:11:03,519
in any other field of contention and

1582
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:05,650
that's it's sort of like the paradox of

1583
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:08,679
the red line and I think Admiral Rogers

1584
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:11,049
mentioned that in one sense on the one

1585
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:13,630
hand if you put down a strict red line

1586
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:15,849
you're committed to it but on the other

1587
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:18,460
hand it's precisely that commitment that

1588
01:11:15,849 --> 01:11:22,030
makes that red line serious in other

1589
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:25,300
words you're constantly doing a risk

1590
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:28,059
evaluation right and so to bind yourself

1591
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:30,070
an alliance is to make that risk

1592
01:11:28,059 --> 01:11:32,170
evaluation and to come down on one side

1593
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:36,039
rather than other and that's what gives

1594
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:37,719
an alliance its power okay now there was

1595
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:39,518
a sort of another thread that I want to

1596
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:43,630
tease here is does what's goes in

1597
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,699
cyberspace stay in cyberspace in other

1598
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:48,579
words do we observe Las Vegas rules for

1599
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:51,489
cyberspace I tend to be the opinion that

1600
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:58,018
for the most part we should buy - a

1601
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:58,018
whole nother question okay Travis next

1602
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:05,469
shape just an observation and then a

1603
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:07,539
question the observation I would say is

1604
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:09,280
this whole issue about attribution and

1605
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:12,579
it actually goes to the Martins last

1606
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:16,480
comment this is really relevant when we

1607
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:18,400
talk about stuff on the Internet okay

1608
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,250
because we treat this a lot of this is

1609
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,710
treating the Internet as some vast and

1610
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:26,980
essentially ambiguous it's like open

1611
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:28,989
seas it's the open seas and network

1612
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,638
equivalent of open seas but that's

1613
01:12:28,989 --> 01:12:32,860
actually not true okay

1614
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:34,869
even the Internet comes to ground even

1615
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:37,539
the Internet is associated with physical

1616
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:39,699
instantiation I don't think we're going

1617
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:41,889
to have any issues with attribution on

1618
01:12:39,699 --> 01:12:43,629
closed networks

1619
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:45,070
because closed networks means that

1620
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:48,119
you've gotten physical access to

1621
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:51,518
something which now becomes a much more

1622
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:54,728
credible threat and the evidence is is

1623
01:12:51,519 --> 01:12:57,159
much more real so first of all is this

1624
01:12:54,729 --> 01:13:00,969
is this simply a reflection of our

1625
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:03,489
struggling to understand security in the

1626
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:06,749
context of the internet and aren't we

1627
01:13:03,489 --> 01:13:08,949
effectively going to come back to

1628
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:12,369
understanding that it's like any other

1629
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:15,039
domain it isn't a domain onto itself and

1630
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:18,909
to to a question I guess back to Martin

1631
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:22,840
to put it in economic terms one of the

1632
01:13:18,909 --> 01:13:25,959
reasons that marketplaces get created is

1633
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,209
for transactional efficiency right you

1634
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:30,849
have a you have the ability to carry out

1635
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:33,820
transactions in an efficient manner and

1636
01:13:30,849 --> 01:13:36,669
I would argue would you not agree that

1637
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:40,419
this is an area that once we can come to

1638
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:42,760
consensus that the internet is in fact

1639
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:47,849
simply another area in which national

1640
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:50,050
security issues take effect that NATO is

1641
01:13:47,849 --> 01:13:51,789
essentially the most efficient

1642
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,829
marketplace in which to carry out

1643
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:58,148
transactions and organizing the

1644
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:59,978
responses military or non-military so I

1645
01:13:58,149 --> 01:14:01,809
think that I think that consensus is

1646
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:05,169
gonna have to wait until I pass from the

1647
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:06,909
same did anybody else would have picked

1648
01:14:05,169 --> 01:14:10,389
that up Martin yeah I would actually

1649
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:11,530
like to jump into that question well not

1650
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:12,969
into the question what into the

1651
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,059
observation so first of all let me

1652
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:18,880
respond with a question back right back

1653
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:22,539
so actually how closed is any network

1654
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:25,530
you are observing today because a closed

1655
01:14:22,539 --> 01:14:28,329
network in technical terms is a computer

1656
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:31,300
or two computers with a cable in between

1657
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:35,469
them and all other signal signaling

1658
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:38,530
devices or Bluetooth wireless anything

1659
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:40,869
else you can there's been I or whatever

1660
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:42,550
else you have as a signaling device

1661
01:14:40,869 --> 01:14:44,589
that's cable that's capable of

1662
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:48,249
communicating you have to take that out

1663
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:50,559
off the computer return it off so that

1664
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:54,249
that is from from a technical point of

1665
01:14:50,559 --> 01:14:56,260
view what a closed network would be

1666
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:58,659
but how often do you actually see this

1667
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,749
nowadays so even if you just have even

1668
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:04,299
if you are in and there's been loads of

1669
01:15:01,749 --> 01:15:06,369
discussions on industry 4.0 about this

1670
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,690
because that's exactly the problem they

1671
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:09,999
are facing now is that they have

1672
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:12,579
networks which were designed to be

1673
01:15:09,999 --> 01:15:14,590
closed but they are no longer closed so

1674
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:16,989
you actually don't really see closed

1675
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:19,840
networks anymore so that was just one

1676
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:27,478
flaw I wanted to kind of push into the

1677
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:30,460
discussion I wanted to comment on on on

1678
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:32,499
attribution and to look at it from the

1679
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,510
step prior to the attribution because

1680
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:37,349
we're talking a lot about attribution

1681
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:40,210
and who's what what what are the best

1682
01:15:37,349 --> 01:15:44,170
alliances or formulations to to improve

1683
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:47,289
that but a prerequisite is that you have

1684
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:50,949
a notification of a breach or that

1685
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:53,710
someone agrees to to admit or or

1686
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:55,780
announce that's something that there is

1687
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:59,469
an attack that needs to be attributed

1688
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:03,249
and I would underline the value yet

1689
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:05,320
again of the --use gdpr in that which

1690
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:07,690
imposes a preach notification

1691
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:10,840
requirement that obliges any company or

1692
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:13,178
institution processing personal

1693
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,190
information to notify the relevant

1694
01:16:13,179 --> 01:16:19,599
authorities within 72 hours and where

1695
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:21,039
this becomes relevant touches yet

1696
01:16:19,599 --> 01:16:24,099
another field that we haven't really

1697
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,179
discussed but that you brought doubt and

1698
01:16:24,099 --> 01:16:28,329
care at the beginning that is

1699
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:33,039
information operations because they're

1700
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:35,139
gdpr becomes relevant in the context of

1701
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,030
election interferences as it implies for

1702
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:39,999
example that any potential breach to the

1703
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,800
databases of electoral campaign teams

1704
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:45,309
will need to be notified

1705
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:48,340
rather than kept secret and and that is

1706
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:50,739
the issue very often that when when

1707
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:54,239
talking about attribution we have to

1708
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:57,598
remind that many nations companies

1709
01:16:54,239 --> 01:17:01,959
organizations associations want to keep

1710
01:16:57,599 --> 01:17:04,659
the attack secret to begin with so and

1711
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:07,239
so that that that poses a difficulty for

1712
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:08,110
the attribution that opens up the whole

1713
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:10,000
issue of Trance

1714
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:12,009
barren sea in itself if it's coordinated

1715
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,830
and agreed being a countermeasure in its

1716
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:18,310
own right leaves the pasta in the front

1717
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:19,719
row was was next my name is Lisa person

1718
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:23,170
I'm with a McCain in city of

1719
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:25,300
international leadership and I'm afraid

1720
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:27,570
I'm having John Park that tribution

1721
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:30,550
issue for the seraglio

1722
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:32,980
I'm increasingly uneasy with these

1723
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:35,489
conversations we're having about either

1724
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:38,110
like a coordinated action in cyberspace

1725
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:40,750
because fundamentally they tend any

1726
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:45,639
response account they measure tends to

1727
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:47,560
rely on that attribution of a single one

1728
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:50,110
of those allies or coalition partners

1729
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:52,270
and the digital forensics of one

1730
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:54,610
basically saying we know it was them

1731
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:58,030
trust us and joined attribution so that

1732
01:17:54,610 --> 01:18:00,159
we can then act together and I'm afraid

1733
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:02,909
we're getting out on really thin ice

1734
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:05,440
there where the political instinct is to

1735
01:18:02,909 --> 01:18:08,230
attribute and we might be getting too

1736
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:12,780
far from the actual technical evidence

1737
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:17,980
in doing so so how do we in both these

1738
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:19,809
families but also these teams of various

1739
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,239
sports metaphors that we've gotten

1740
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:26,139
carried away with how do we avoid

1741
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:28,718
getting on that lean eyes of where we go

1742
01:18:26,139 --> 01:18:31,960
to find the political attribution for

1743
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:36,369
the sake of political signaling and and

1744
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:38,340
taking action but we don't get too

1745
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:40,690
carried away from the actual technical

1746
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,969
evidence that the only one of the

1747
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:45,790
coalition partners allies might have and

1748
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:48,460
might as merely very eloquently just

1749
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:51,219
know did not be particularly willing to

1750
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:53,590
share even notify is there anybody in

1751
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:55,320
particularly wanted to answer okay well

1752
01:18:53,590 --> 01:19:00,580
I'll go first

1753
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:01,840
Kim presented a case study in in an on

1754
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:03,699
site with the member which I think

1755
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,869
carries over to partially provide a

1756
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:08,049
suggestion for an answer to your

1757
01:19:04,869 --> 01:19:09,699
question Kim explains the the British

1758
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,800
government's response to this cripple to

1759
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:14,230
attack just over a year ago in Salisbury

1760
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:17,230
where the the approach was to release a

1761
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:19,509
limited amount of information in order

1762
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:20,669
to allow external organizations in this

1763
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:22,860
case the world media

1764
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:24,960
and the media in Russia to conduct their

1765
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:27,089
own investigations and determine what

1766
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,010
had happened now I think that that is an

1767
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,450
analogy that under certain circumstances

1768
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:33,810
you can carry across into the cyber

1769
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:35,610
domain because in the place of the media

1770
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:37,860
and investigative journalists and Berlin

1771
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:39,330
cat and their friends you have the cyber

1772
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,610
security companies that have the

1773
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:42,960
resources and the access to track down

1774
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,719
exactly the same kind of information

1775
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,840
based on the initial nudge from

1776
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,730
governments and therefore arrive at a

1777
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,860
conclusion which is not actually being

1778
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:56,459
presented on a plate by a national

1779
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:59,009
government but is in fact agreed among

1780
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:02,460
an organization that spans many

1781
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:03,660
different countries now the one thing

1782
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,460
that we haven't actually mentioned in

1783
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,530
all of this conversation so far is the

1784
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:10,320
private sector is the platform's is the

1785
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:11,490
security organizations and my question

1786
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,259
which if any of the rest of the

1787
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:16,380
panelists want to pick it up now is if

1788
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:19,050
we are considering an organization where

1789
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:21,390
the formal undeclared or or informal and

1790
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,030
ad-hoc which is intended to respond to

1791
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:25,800
these challenges need we necessarily be

1792
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:28,559
thinking only in terms of nation-states

1793
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,970
joining it or should we in fact be

1794
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,740
considering broadening it out to

1795
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:34,440
organizations that are not nation states

1796
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,120
for example security organizations for

1797
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,769
example the NGOs that have been so

1798
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:42,059
active in countering information

1799
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:46,890
operations absolutely and and companies

1800
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:50,100
and but then it's it's not an alliance

1801
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:56,220
of states indeed but it's something that

1802
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:58,920
goes beyond that and an NGO an institute

1803
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:02,340
or or or whatnot

1804
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:05,910
I think you are very right that when

1805
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:08,490
discussing this we cannot leave other

1806
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:10,530
actors aside and states are definitely

1807
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:15,780
not the only only and they and the main

1808
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:17,580
actors here cyberspace does have the

1809
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:19,650
characteristics that private enterprises

1810
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:23,309
potentially play a much larger role than

1811
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:24,420
they do in our other domains but you

1812
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:28,070
don't have to have them as part of

1813
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,070
coalition's they'll take a check

1814
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:36,420
well I'm sorry my voice again so first

1815
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,799
of all I want to thank you for the

1816
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,750
question because I think it's accident

1817
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,010
that there are other people who are

1818
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:43,380
actually bearing in mind that we don't

1819
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:46,290
care that we don't want to see a drift

1820
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:48,930
between policymakers and strategic

1821
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:51,180
operations and the technical people and

1822
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:57,240
today I should not leave out the digital

1823
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:59,160
forensics so and I also think to add to

1824
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,889
what Marilyn said I also think that it's

1825
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:04,200
crucial that we move away from an

1826
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:07,110
alliance that is purely based on state

1827
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:09,960
in on state officials I think it's it's

1828
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:11,429
a very good idea and it's actually one

1829
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,120
of the things that was demonstrated with

1830
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,210
the Salsbury

1831
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:17,550
attack case well you did not just have

1832
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:19,020
media investigating the case based on

1833
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:22,500
the evidence provided but actually also

1834
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:25,410
academia we were able to get a portion

1835
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,790
of the of the poison that was found in

1836
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,860
this animus cripples body and

1837
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:31,470
investigate that and make their own

1838
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:34,170
chemical analysis so in the same

1839
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:36,390
perspective you could do that with cyber

1840
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:38,340
incidents because as I mentioned earlier

1841
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:40,680
in digital forum said it's it's not hard

1842
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:43,140
to make a copy now of course we have to

1843
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,790
discuss what type of information do we

1844
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,880
want to have in this copy because yes

1845
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:50,640
you do disclose some of your information

1846
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,500
with opening your logs or whatever you

1847
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:56,010
have that you that you use for the

1848
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:58,740
digital forensics but at the same time

1849
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:02,310
the amounts of information that you are

1850
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:05,429
releasing may if you select wisely must

1851
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:06,810
be that crucial ok can I make an

1852
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:10,230
additional note here there's a big

1853
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:14,400
difference between getting the help from

1854
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:17,759
somebody and relying on the fact that

1855
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,290
that help is going to come in about 20

1856
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,000
years ago a gentleman by name of Eric

1857
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:22,980
Raymond made an argument about

1858
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,560
open-source software to the effect that

1859
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:28,139
was enough eyes looking at the code all

1860
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,670
bugs are shallow then a few years ago we

1861
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,530
found out in fact that there was a lot

1862
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:34,620
of vulnerabilities in open code source

1863
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:36,480
software why because it turns out that

1864
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:38,190
not all the eyes were looking that the

1865
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,349
eyes tended to clump in certain places

1866
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:42,320
and not other places right that the

1867
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:44,390
voluntary interest had

1868
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,679
it had was more interested in certain

1869
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:47,750
parts of the code than other parts of

1870
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,880
the code one of the purposes of

1871
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:52,040
something like a government is to

1872
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:55,730
allocate attention appropriately and not

1873
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,780
to merely the go and without it you have

1874
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,759
an interest in things that are

1875
01:23:56,780 --> 01:24:00,860
high-profile get people's attention and

1876
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:03,260
less interest in those things that may

1877
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:05,480
not seem as high-profile and not as

1878
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:08,210
important but in fact merit just as much

1879
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:11,240
attention so if I just may jump into

1880
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:13,790
data again so there is a big difference

1881
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,889
from a technical perspective from

1882
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:17,870
securing code and doing digital

1883
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:19,610
forensics because securing code is like

1884
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:21,980
an open field you have this code and it

1885
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:24,500
could be any type of realities in it

1886
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:28,009
whereas for digital forensics you do

1887
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,360
have a certain amount of logs or faults

1888
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:31,610
that you'd need to look at and you can

1889
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,059
draw conclusions from from those now you

1890
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:37,610
may not get back to a 100% sure of what

1891
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:39,140
has been passed and done from the

1892
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:43,099
information you have but it's it's

1893
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:45,350
another task so this should actually

1894
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:47,450
more be looked at and the way that

1895
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:50,510
academia works so when you open up for

1896
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:52,490
example the way you've been doing an

1897
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:54,740
experiment in your lab and the myth of

1898
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:56,420
mythology you were using in your lab and

1899
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:58,160
you open up for this or at the

1900
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:00,710
conference describing it to the other

1901
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:03,349
academia to actually be able to

1902
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:06,800
reproduce the results you were getting

1903
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:09,650
this is more what what digital forensics

1904
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,830
would be like if you opened up to a

1905
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:15,440
global let's not call it Alliance let's

1906
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:16,820
call it an organization we have a few

1907
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,349
minutes remaining let's take a couple of

1908
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,179
questions possibly three if they're very

1909
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,830
brief I particularly invite the second

1910
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:23,360
row here to join them because I think I

1911
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,550
saw a couple of questions brewing and do

1912
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:28,570
but I end up if if you want to launch it

1913
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:31,460
let's take Maria first and she's ready

1914
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:33,440
mic morning I'm Maria from the Singapore

1915
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,540
Ministry of Defence my question is kind

1916
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,070
of open to all the panelists but perhaps

1917
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,140
mainly professor Luba key and miss

1918
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,950
Hartman as well so a lot of countries

1919
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,210
have come out to lay out their

1920
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:44,540
strategies about like persistent

1921
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:46,130
engagement or in terms of the Japanese

1922
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,150
strategy I'm not from the details but

1923
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:48,320
they've also come out to say that

1924
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:51,950
they're willing to disrupt attacks

1925
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:54,259
before they reach homeland however you

1926
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:55,170
wanted to find that and we had a very

1927
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,090
interesting panel

1928
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:58,740
if dr. Smith from Stanford talking about

1929
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:00,750
how these strategies can actually cause

1930
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,550
friction among allies and partners if

1931
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:05,400
they're not really consulted beforehand

1932
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:06,920
or even informed before the fact so how

1933
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,389
do you see the emergence of new

1934
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,380
coalition's or alliances where we are

1935
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:13,020
assuming that there's going to be a

1936
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:15,300
larger consensus on executing or

1937
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:17,490
managing efforts I persistent engagement

1938
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,680
and how do you see that polarizing the

1939
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:20,820
world moving forward I'll turn

1940
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,170
ten-second Barry could you pass the

1941
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:28,830
microphone forward please to the second

1942
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:30,900
row here good morning Tyler Kim u.s.

1943
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:33,780
Naval Academy this question is open for

1944
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:35,250
any member of the panel this was kind of

1945
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,509
slightly touched on into previous

1946
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,700
questions but I would like to kind of

1947
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:42,270
hear a little bit more in depth

1948
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:46,290
explanation in terms of asphaltic cyber

1949
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:47,700
alliance or potentially a cyber NATO how

1950
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:49,680
could this potentially give rise to a

1951
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:52,559
competing cyber alliance perhaps on the

1952
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:55,110
Russian side and what compromise do you

1953
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,930
envision arising from such a competing

1954
01:26:55,110 --> 01:27:00,150
alliance thank you okay we have three

1955
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:01,380
minutes so let's just draw a stumps

1956
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:03,929
there I told you to get the cricket in

1957
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:06,960
somehow Martens with them yeah let me

1958
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:08,490
try to answer both in terms of

1959
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,290
persistent engagement the number of

1960
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:12,809
countries that actually can actually do

1961
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:16,170
it may be relatively small and you have

1962
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:18,270
a smaller prop you have a smaller group

1963
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:19,500
I'm not entirely certain whether

1964
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:23,130
persistent engagement was actually

1965
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:25,410
efficacious to a large extent because I

1966
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:28,100
think successes and failures are with a

1967
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:30,420
few one rare exception all classified

1968
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:33,390
okay in terms of counter

1969
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,680
coalition-building with the Russians who

1970
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:38,190
these guys really have a whole lot of

1971
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:43,560
friends right and maybe the Armenians

1972
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:47,160
and PLO roots occasionally but they play

1973
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:48,480
in different worlds they really do which

1974
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,680
is not to say that they don't have

1975
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,629
alliances of the wrong

1976
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:54,210
so these vibrant information security

1977
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:56,430
elements of the the csto for example the

1978
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:58,740
SCO information security agreement all

1979
01:27:56,430 --> 01:28:00,000
look like counter coalition's all in

1980
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,530
fact represents something slightly

1981
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,630
different as Martha was alluding to it

1982
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:05,190
because even within the CSTO not

1983
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:07,350
everybody thinks that Russia is your

1984
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:09,030
friend even if it's your ally so yes

1985
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:10,560
there is a self limiting factor

1986
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:13,440
in terms of the responses to the other

1987
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,720
side forward but again you you also have

1988
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,089
the mirror image if there is one big

1989
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,800
player adversary and a lot of people

1990
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:22,470
that might coalesce around them and and

1991
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,000
generally follow the same view whether

1992
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:27,150
or not they're actually engaging in

1993
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,770
active operations so yes it is it is an

1994
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:31,110
issue but I think it is not one that

1995
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:33,930
would be aggravated in any way by any

1996
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:35,790
form of closer coalition or agreement

1997
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:37,230
between Western liberal democracies

1998
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:39,690
because that was greement is basically

1999
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:41,519
already in place and I'd throw the

2000
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:44,009
open-ended working group in the in in

2001
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:47,090
the well I mean an initiative proposed

2002
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:49,590
within the UN proposed by Russia to

2003
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:51,480
study the establishing regular

2004
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:58,320
institutional dialogue and then study

2005
01:28:51,480 --> 01:29:01,019
study norms which is being countered by

2006
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,090
the proper governmental experts studying

2007
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,150
the how international law applies to

2008
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:08,430
state action in cyberspace and and how

2009
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:10,290
to promote compliance with the existing

2010
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:11,610
norms in the very short time we have

2011
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:13,980
remaining that everybody went to great

2012
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:16,110
Maria's question or is that one to

2013
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:18,719
unpack over coffee I would just quickly

2014
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:22,110
say that I believe that friction among

2015
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,610
allies with me of course offer arise but

2016
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:25,950
I don't think it's a problem because I

2017
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:28,230
just think it's a it's a discussion that

2018
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:32,970
we would have as we do in democratic

2019
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:34,589
states on a constant basis seems like a

2020
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,850
good time to end thank you very much

2021
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,140
everybody for joining in what's been a

2022
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,820
fascinating session there are things

2023
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,890
here that we could talk about all day

2024
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:42,509
probably all week but please join me

2025
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:43,530
thanking the panelists and enjoy the

2026

coffee break

2027
