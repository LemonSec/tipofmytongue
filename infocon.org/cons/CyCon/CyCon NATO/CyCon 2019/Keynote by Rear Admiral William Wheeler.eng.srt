1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,380
I tell you what that's pretty

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,068
intimidating to stand up here after a

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,099
president and a veteran of 41 years but

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:15,269
it is absolutely an honor to be here so

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,910
so thank you thank you so much I know

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,279
Madam President had to leave but please

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,050
please pass her my appreciation to her

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,480
and the entire Smithsonian delegation

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,789
for the great support that they have

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,340
provided for this this conference and

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,949
now and we also had the sovereign

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,239
commanders forum prior to this well I

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,610
believe we had 30 heads of heads of the

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,349
the military cyber units from 30

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,850
different countries here so it was an

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,800
absolute honor to get to know them and

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,800
and spend time with them as well

18
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,930

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,039
impressive to stand up here and look out

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,899
over this crowd and I would also like to

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,700
have a quick quick recognition for our

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:13,950
Naval Academy Midshipmen that are here

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,869
and our West Point cadets to truly the

27

general NACA Sony in the men and women

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,330
of US Cyber Command thank you for the

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,970
opportunity to address this

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,150
distinguished forum it is truly an honor

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,369
to be back in Estonia I was here just

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,579
just over two years ago where I had the

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,009
opportunity to participate in the

38
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:43,770
Estonian Independence Day festivities

39
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,420
which are held in February ladies and

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,420
gentleman you do not need sunscreen in

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,220
February in Estonia I promise you but it

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,640
was it was great and our hosts were all

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,470
were fantastic then and they have as I

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,960
mentioned been fantastic on this event

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,090
as well so my name as mentioned his rear

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,649
mo tre wheeler and the director of plans

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,180
and policy the g5 at US Cyber Command as

48
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,360
the career naval flight also I will

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,950
admit I am NOT steeped in the background

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,470
of the cyber domain like many of you in

51
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,859
this room so I'm certainly not going to

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,300
try to

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,940
press you with a discussion about

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,070
switches or routers or a gray space or

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,870
any of that any of that kind of stuff

56
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,959
but I I would like to take a few minutes

57
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,660
to talk about US Cyber Command where

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,380
we've been what we're seeing now and

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,820
where we're going

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,329
so yes Cyber Command was established in

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,549
May of 2010 so that's nine years ago and

62
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,690
a little quiz for you

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,420
saikhan is how old 11 years old so it's

64
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,690
older than US Cyber Command

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,179
so May of 2010 and what we in the United

66
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,150
States refer to as a sub unified command

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,120
which which really means that we we're

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,900
under the oversight of another four-star

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,390
command and that's good and it allows

70
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,750
that sub unified command to to mature

71
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,279
and build and develop and in our case to

72
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,230
develop our u.s. cyber force at that

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,930
time exploitation and disruption

74
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,160
activities comprise the major cyber

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,130
threats to our nation's critical

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,630
infrastructure with our adversaries

77
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,630
demonstrating effective but somewhat

78
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,820
basic capabilities US Cyber Command was

79
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,310
focused on defending the Department of

80
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,100
Defense networks and supporting our

81
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,390
geographic combatant commands commanders

82
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,920
specifically in Iraq and Afghanistan the

83
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,040
command was envisioned and originally

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,339
designed is primarily a response force

85
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,239
supporting counterterrorism operations

86
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,350
conducting planning to support

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,140
conventional forces in a crisis and

88
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,350
maintaining the capacity to respond to

89
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,350
an attack of significant consequence

90
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,600
against our critical infrastructure the

91
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,600
US Department of Defense proposed and

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,049
received approval to establish a hundred

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,810
and thirty three cyber units made up of

94
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,150
both offensive and defensive teams to

95
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,530
execute these responsibilities and

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,450
defend our interest in the cyber domain

97
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,910
over the next several years US Cyber

98
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,610
Command remained focused on building

99
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,820
these teams ensuring the personnel the

100
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,780
equipment the training was acquired to

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,860
enable these team

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,349
to perform their mission as we develop

103
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,490
the cyber mission force our adversaries

104
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,440
continued to evolve nation states

105
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,230
transitioned from exploitation to

106
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,600
disruption to destructive attacks in

107
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,340
cyberspace

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,410
we observed cyber assaults against our

109
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,810
financial sector we witnessed attacks

110
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,270
against the Sands Casino and Sony

111
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,580
Pictures and we knew the theft of

112
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,659
security related data from the Office of

113
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,210
Personnel Management today we are seeing

114
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,270
what many refer to as a corrosive threat

115
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,849
the weaponizing of information to

116
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,270
conduct influence campaigns to include

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,560
targeting part of our domestic processes

118
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,409
now these various activities are not

119
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:21,300
isolated hacks or incidents but our

120
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,610
strategic campaigns by nation-states we

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,330
recognized in the initial concept on

122
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:32,610
which we develop there's 133 teams back

123
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:35,849
in 2010 had to mature we had to adapt we

124
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,340
could no longer be a Response Force in

125
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,200
the last year general NACA Sony has

126
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,440
challenged US Cyber Command and with the

127
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,169
support of the US Department of Defense

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,440
to be more action-oriented focused on

129
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,409
producing results based on a few

130
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,150
foundational concepts we adjusted to an

131
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,030
approach we refer to as persistent

132
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,979
engagement operating forward while

133
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,770
adapting to the tactics techniques and

134
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,620
procedures of our adversaries

135
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,830
now these foundational concepts are

136
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,830
really quite straightforward first our

137
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,349
nations are in constant contact with our

138
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,680
adversaries the adversaries are out

139
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,229
there every day looking for our

140
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,850
vulnerabilities we cannot sit back and

141
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:26,430
wait we must engage second our security

142
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,979
is being challenged in cyberspace our

143
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,440
adversaries are proficient and we must

144
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,070
actively defend we must conduct

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,200
reconnaissance we must understand our

146
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:41,580
adversaries capabilities and their

147
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,490
intent third superiority in cyberspace

148
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,770
temporary we may achieve it for a period

149
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,939
of time but is extremely difficult to

150
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,479
maintain and forth the advantage favors

151
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,409
those who demonstrate the initiative to

152
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,780
achieve an advantage we must

153
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,240
continuously improve our defenses create

154
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,270
new accesses and upgrade our

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,300
capabilities so ladies and gentlemen we

156
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,188
are in a period of great power

157
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,810
competition our adversaries are

158
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,120
operating below the threshold of armed

159
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,300
conflict but they are continuously

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,599
operating just as the nature of cyber

161
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,409
attacks have evolved so too has cyber US

162
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,719
Cyber Command

163
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:25,319
so we've matured from that response

164
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:29,610
force to a persistence force a force to

165
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,530
operate forward operating forward so so

166
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,159
being being a sailor you know the

167
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,799
concept of operating forward resonated

168
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,020
with me I understood that with our Navy

169
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,990
operating forward we're able to better

170
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,389
understand the environment gain insights

171
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,210
that we simply could not observe if we

172
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,039
remain in port our Navy operates for to

173
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,818
defend the sea lines of communication

174
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,710
which are critical to our global trade

175
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,750
it allows us to train and operate with

176
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,419
our partners sharing tactics techniques

177
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,849
and procedures so I believe many of

178
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,460
these same concepts apply to our to our

179
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:09,300
cyber forces when we use the concept of

180
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,210
operating forward so we have shifted our

181
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,159
focus from simply building those 133

182
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:19,190
units there's a 133 teams to operating

183
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:22,199
operating those teams building readiness

184
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,659
capability and capacity we've learned

185
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,569
traditional responses against those who

186
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:31,050
have penetrated our networks stolen our

187
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,140
data or deface our websites must be

188
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,419
refined we've learned if we're going to

189
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,569
have an impact if we're going to change

190
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,419
your behavior we have to be persistently

191
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:47,190
engaged we must understand the adversary

192
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,680
and we must be able to impose cost we've

193
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,260
learned in cyberspace it's the use of

194
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,319
the capabilities that is strategically

195
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,970
consequential

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,519
the threat of using something in

197
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,480
cyberspace is not nearly as powerful as

198
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,759
actually using it so all of us in this

199
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,860
room understand the global nature of the

200
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,350
cyber cyber space domain our

201
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,089
communications are our economies are

202
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,940
very livelihoods depend on our ability

203
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,889
to protect and secure the domain one in

204
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,259
which the overwhelming majority of the

205
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:22,430
networks that critical infrastructure

206
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:24,319
resides in the private sector in the

207
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,930
United States the Department of Defense

208
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:28,130
and US Cyber Command have a critical

209
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,160
role to play in the defense of these

210
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,199
networks we both enable the Department

211
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,019
of Homeland Security and the Federal

212
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:37,519
Bureau of Investigation with information

213
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,610
and intelligence to more effectively

214
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,019
work with our private sectors we are

215
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,319
building critical partnerships with

216
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,930
industry academia various agencies

217
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:52,540
within our government and critically

218
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,540
important to many of you in this room

219
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,480
the u.s. defense strategy outlines

220
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:02,569
partnerships as a key element for

221
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,269
success operating and defending in the

222
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:07,849
cyber domain is ultimately it's an

223
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:12,260
ultimate team sport and we are on the

224
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:16,510
same team so team so a quick story if I

225
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,490
may so as I was as I was growing up my

226
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,529
my home was right across the street from

227
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,500
a public park and in that part was a

228
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:27,290
basketball court so after school every

229
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,510
day as soon as I got home I headed to

230
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,149
the basketball court played basketball

231
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,769
until it got dark and then I would go

232
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:39,769
home I was a I joined my first official

233
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,000
team when I was about 10 years old so

234
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:44,060
this was the first time we had some

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,889
really really coaching and our coach was

236
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,899
really focused on the fundamentals you

237
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:51,470
know how to dribble how to pass how to

238
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:55,250
shoot and how to play defense and on

239
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:58,310
defense he he taught us as own defense

240
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,519
so two guards Center two forwards and

241
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:05,000
the concept was was rather simple but it

242
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,220
was fall back on your into the court set

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,860
up in a tight zone defense keep your

244
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,880
hands up

245
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,970
when the other team approached you you

246
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,760
did your best to defend but but the key

247
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,800
was when they when they shot you were in

248
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,080
a good position to get the rebound

249
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,150
you got the rebound and then now you're

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,640
on offense

251
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:31,610
well that weren't good at that age with

252
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,770
that level of skill set as I got older

253
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:39,570
you know the game got faster the players

254
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:43,230
larger much quicker much more much more

255
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,760
fierce the techniques of falling back

256
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:51,300
into that zone didn't work quite as well

257
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:54,450
so our coach at that time preferred a

258
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,449
much more aggressive defense it was a

259
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,090
full-court defense so as soon as the

260
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,260
other team shot we get we got the ball

261
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:09,840
we immediately went on the defensive

262
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:11,640
hands up being aggressive in the in the

263
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,770
opponents into the court so in the

264
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,740
entire length of the court you were on

265
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:19,800
defense we kept our opponent off balance

266
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,760
calls them to make mistakes the approach

267
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,520
was still defensive but we were no

268
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,710
longer waiting for them to come to us it

269
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,480
was a pressure defense a persistent

270
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:37,980
defense in the other teams space so this

271
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,950
approach required discipline required

272
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,290
good communications and you had to have

273
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,680
the right players to play but at the end

274
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,630
of the day whether we won or lost it was

275
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,010
still is still dependent on how well we

276
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:55,560
played together as a team so ladies and

277
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,230
gentlemen being active defending forward

278
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,500
engaging our adversary and enabling our

279
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,140
partners our teammates those are the

280
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,660
elements which are the cornerstone of

281
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,620
the persistent engagement strategy being

282
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,209
used by US Cyber Command today last fall

283
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,670
a team from US Cyber Command in the

284
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,190
National Security Agency supported us

285
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,780
European Command and the u.s. Northern

286
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,100
Command the Department of Homeland

287
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,300
Security in the Federal Bureau of

288
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,420
Investigation

289
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,760
to protect the integrity of America's

290
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,740
2018 elections several countries

291
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,130
represented here today were also

292
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,180
instrumental in supporting that effort

293
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,760
we very much appreciate the

294
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,400
collaboration and the support from our

295
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,500
international partners if nothing else

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,459
that experience reinforced the concept

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,320
of partnerships of being a good team we

298
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,330
would not have been successful not for

299
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,150
the great work the great work together

300
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,870
working side-by-side with all of our

301
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,939
partners so US Cyber Command has evolved

302
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,760
since it was established in 2010 nine

303
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,200
years ago we work in a competitive space

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,210
and we understand we must continue to

305
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,930
seek the tactical and operational and

306
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:12,480
strategic initiative our persistent

307
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:16,109
engagement approach must be closely tied

308
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,140
with persistent innovation to ensure our

309
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,600
accesses our tools our techniques and

310
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,630
our procedures keep pace we must

311
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,110
continue to recruit trained mentor and

312
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,850
retain the best and brightest as we work

313
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,360
to meld our intelligence and operations

314
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,530
to achieve results we must remain ahead

315
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,220
of our adversaries in both knowledge and

316
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:44,010
inaction and we must be good partners

317
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,920
which again is why I'm so very honored

318
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,740
to be here with you this morning

319
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,920
it's truly humbling it's an honor to be

320
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,710
back in Estonia and it's honored to be

321
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,339
your teammate thank you very much

322
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,339
