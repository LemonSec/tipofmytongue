1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
so hello everyone and welcome back from

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,200
the coffee break we are here to discuss

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,389
the election security is something that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,300
has been discussed widely something that

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:16,369
has proved lot cost lots of controversy

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:21,539
and something that has become perhaps

7
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:23,340
kind of a buzzword by today and at first

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,740
i have to say that unfortunately our

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,960
original moderator dr. Camino Cavanaugh

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,729
couldn't make it here today which is why

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,790
it's me on Valley Daaga the session

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,290
manager and legal researcher at NATO CCD

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,839
CoA who will take vulnerable and might I

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,550
say a bit intimidating task to moderate

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,070
a panel actually here right now so first

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,269
we have a very distinguished panel here

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,430
made up of technical experts policy

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,219
strategy experts and an active

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:02,550
politician in fact so we have a exciting

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,659
mixture of perspectives and let's hope

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,570
for truly enriching discussion first of

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,140
all I would like to introduce our

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,070
panelists starting with dr. herb Lin on

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,110
my left hand who's the senior research

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:27,740
scholar at Stanford University's Center

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:30,299
for cyber policy and security and also

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,939
Hank J Holland fellow of cyber security

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,560
at Hoover Institution at Stanford also

29
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,929
and besides that he is the author of

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,009
multiple publications on security

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,560
ranging from cyber security to

32
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:49,979
Biosciences and most recently he his

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,229
book called bite bombs and spice the

34
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,329
strategic dimension of offensive cyber

35
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,189
operations then we have dr. Chasen nurse

36
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,508
associate professor of cyber security at

37
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,630
the University of Kent mmm doctor nurses

38
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:09,470
main areas of interests include cyber

39
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,760
security privacy and the risks

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:17,020
associated with their of among other

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,100
things he had looked he has looked into

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,410
how the procedure procedural security

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,870
safeguards actually play a role in

44
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:32,810
securing internet voting systems and on

45
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,350
the other end of the table we have

46
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,630
Morita Chaka who's active volatile

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,180
politician served as a member of the

48
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:46,790
European Parliament from 2009 until 2019

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:52,520
where she actively pushed for digital

50
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:54,829
freedoms copyright issues in addition to

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,050
that she has served after chief of

52
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:01,600
server of the European Union election

53
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:04,010
observation mission to Kenya and she

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,769
also has been a member of the

55
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,850
transatlantic Commission on election

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:15,220
integrity so we have really a wide array

57
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:18,650
of perspectives presented here and

58
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,410
perhaps this is my personal group for

59
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,600
the session by the end of the session

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,480
everybody would have a more clear

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,150
perspective of what we talk about when

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,340
we talk about the cybersecurity of

63
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,760
Elections originally the panel was

64
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:38,180
titled election security and cyber

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,519
security different yet complementary and

66
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,299
this is maybe the guiding theme for

67
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,709
today's discussion so I would like to

68
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:52,519
start by asking your personal assessment

69
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,100
of the current risks are free and fair

70
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,500
elections in peril or on the contrary

71
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,959
are the risks currently associated with

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,180
cyber and cyber enable let's make a

73
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,890
distinction here threats a bit

74
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:10,370
exaggerated let's start with her so the

75
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,260
question is are they free elections in

76
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,760
peril because of the cyber and cyber

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,320
enabled operations

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:23,690
well they in in in my view they are

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,599
yet the yes and no no in in in the sense

80
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:32,330
that they are nobody's holding there's

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,800
no physical force involved we're not at

82
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,830
the point where we have to have election

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,300
monitors you know police at station you

84
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:45,979
know at voting stations to to enforce a

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,800
person's right to actually cast in two

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,610
senses once one is the security of the

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,580
underlying technological infrastructure

88
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,860
for supporting voting and and the other

89
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,490
is in the information that they that

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,610
voters receive and if you believe that

91
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,340
good information is necessary for votes

92
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,540
to be cast properly and that yes that is

93
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,400
in peril so Jason you have any to add to

94
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,960
that yeah I mean with the green number

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,359
different ways I think yes they're in

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,489
peril for especially because these days

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,800
when it comes to I would focus more on

98
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,520
the the voters as I say the main of the

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,350
voters and also the the candidates in

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,060
general because while I believe know

101
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,920
there's a significant emphasis on kind

102
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,200
of beefing up the security of voting

103
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,720
systems voting processes and things like

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,039
this where I think attackers have kind

105
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,450
of recognized that and what they're

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,040
doing is they're targeting the minds of

107
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,510
voters with misinformation and things

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,780
like this and then there are also

109
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,969
targeting politicians we've seen this

110
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,219
kind of repeatedly where there's been

111
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,740
much more focus on if you can't get to

112
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,450
the electronic systems and you can't get

113
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,920
to the minds of voters or in compliment

114
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,950
in compliment together the minds of

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,430
voters basically trying to attack

116
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,900
candidates maybe steal emails maybe get

117
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,550
anything out slightly incriminating and

118
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,469
publish that to try to aim to discredit

119
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,020
candidates so I think it from my

120
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,730
perspective I can definitely agree and

121
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,780
also add to the fact that I think

122
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,030
they're imperiled simply because of

123
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,609
these reasons and because it's it's it's

124
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,929
kind of the attack platform that we are

125
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,490
faced with these days marita yeah so

126
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,340
thanks for having me and thanks for

127
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,280
stepping in to moderate

128
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,719
I think we cannot be vigilant enough

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,390
when it comes to protecting the

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,890
Democratic rights of our citizens and so

131
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,169
I'm gonna focus for the answering of

132
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,719
this question on Europe particularly but

133
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,420
on the role of democracies to enable

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,540
free and fair elections in the broadest

135
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,890
possible sense for the moment so we can

136
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,320
talk globally as well because obviously

137
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,950
this is not just a challenge in Europe

138
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,930
or in the US and Europe but I like to

139
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,510
think about the democratic process and

140
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,030
elections as an ecosystem and I think

141
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,039
there are a number of very clear

142
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,650
weaknesses in that entire ecosystem one

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,630
there have been blatant attacks attempts

144
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,989
at hacking on the level of the

145
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,550
technology used for the elections itself

146
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,500
so that's one area where I believe we

147
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,240
need more stress testing and where we

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,610
need higher standards for example

149
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,290
identifying election technologies as

150
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,950
critical infrastructure that would

151
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,320
automatically enter into play a number

152
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,780
of requirements for higher protection of

153
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,210
these systems that would then count as

154
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,599
infrastructure so this this is on the

155
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,700
level of election committees the

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,620
ministries that are organizing the

157
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,900
elections and basically the the

158
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,270
government side of organizing elections

159
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,969
but then there's a number of other

160
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,560
actors that come into the picture when

161
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,420
you think about elections I think

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,960
political parties and and you mention it

163
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,780
are particularly weak potentially why

164
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,630
because in Europe especially a number of

165
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,599
them have to have to function on the

166
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,250
basis of donations from members

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,140
contributions and a little bit of

168
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,670
taxpayer money depending on the

169
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,590
proportionate representation they have

170
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,150
but they don't have vast amounts of

171
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,969
money and if the choice is between

172
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,359
buying another ad on television in that

173
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,880
campaign season or running top level

174
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
cybersecurity programs on your

175
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,450
infrastructure well I know from

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,720
experience that the choices are easily

177
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:26,530
made to spend every euro on reaching

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,140
voters and campaigning so questions

179
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,599
about you know voter registers or

180
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,880
internal primary processes that often

181
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,889
happen through a voting and an online

182
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,139
system

183
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,209
for the registration for referenda is

184
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,129
another very interesting question people

185
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,988
can bring about a referendum on the

186
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,670
basis of signatures now how secure is

187
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,189
that process and how easy or how

188
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,608
difficult is it to forge signatures and

189
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:52,139
then to force a referendum with possibly

190
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:53,730
devastating consequences so in the

191
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,399
entire ecosystem of the use of

192
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,959
technologies from the authorities that

193
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,939
are responsible to the political parties

194
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,059
indeed the candidates who may not at all

195
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:05,160
be prepared for being hacked or or that

196
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,980
sort of stuff and then the question if a

197
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,269
hack is successful and if for example

198
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,279
sensitive information is compromised

199
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,470
then how do media respond to this

200
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,290
are they eager to publish a leak because

201
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,499
they know it will be a sensation or are

202
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,480
they going to apply the proper scrutiny

203
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:23,419
to to assess whether this is indeed

204
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,829
information in the public interest or

205
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,589
information that is purely intended to

206
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,029
manipulate a democratic process and then

207
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,100
lastly and maybe we'll talk about that a

208
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:35,189
bit more later there's the whole

209
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,049
question of disinformation and a lot has

210
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,910
been said about Russia and I am sure in

211
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,589
Estonia that's no exception but I

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,540
encourage you all to think much more

213
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:44,879
broadly than just focusing on Russia

214
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,118
Russia is definitely not the only actor

215
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,459
trying to influence minds in in less

216
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:52,110
than transparent ways but there are

217
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,929
certainly a lot of other foreign actors

218
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,589
domestic actors increasingly involved in

219
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:00,600
this and I think we focus insufficiently

220
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,059
on the role of technology companies

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,459
themselves if we're honest there's a lot

222
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,949
we don't know yet we don't know exactly

223
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,439
how algorithms that are ranking and

224
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:13,829
selecting and presenting and promoting

225
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:15,238
information are actually influencing the

226
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:18,269
way in which people's independent

227
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:20,389
decision to make a choice on a

228
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,980
well-informed basis is actually

229
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:26,100
manipulated we don't know enough about

230
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,289
how easy or hard it is to abuse the

231
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,259
platforms that also have legitimate

232
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,359
purpose but that's due to their opaque

233
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,579
business models and due to the fact that

234
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:37,350
it is indeed now a marketplace of ideas

235
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,539
where the more money you throw at

236
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,029
promoting a message the more eyeballs

237
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:45,480
you can reach the more time of people's

238
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,970
minds you can attract is really the

239
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,639
dynamic that we we need to scrutinize so

240
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,350
just a few pointers to kick off this

241
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,540
discussion about why I think that we

242
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,189
cannot be vigilant enough when it comes

243
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,319
to protecting the democratic rights of

244
00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:01,410
our citizens thank you

245
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:03,060
anything to add from my perspective the

246
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,779
question about these possible words I

247
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,719
agree with everything you said is should

248
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,490
the platforms be giving people the

249
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,279
information they want or the information

250
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,920
they need and those are very different

251
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,420
statement questions to ask right now

252
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,329
they're optimized to give people the

253
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,160
information they want and it's not clear

254
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:27,120
that the information that people say

255
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,399
they want and the people that what they

256
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,100
actually want is what's needed to

257
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,899
support real of democracy so I agree

258
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,639
with everything yeah I think we could

259
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,470
even get more philosophical so I think

260
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,980
the question is you know if you've once

261
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,860
searched for antidepressants or if

262
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,259
you've once searched for crime rates by

263
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,110
immigrants in your neighborhood does

264
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,779
that indicate that you want a certain

265
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,120
political advertisements to pop up in

266
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,629
your timeline over and over again I mean

267
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:01,019
what is what in this in this case and

268
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,879
what is sort of push obviously paid for

269
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,110
by certain actors or in a clever way

270
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,389
manipulated

271
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,779
what role does micro-targeting so using

272
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:12,600
very very fine-tuned data to then tap

273
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:16,050
into a menus for political ads but also

274
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,670
more broadly advertising I think is the

275
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,160
fundamental question we need to have and

276
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,069
I believe we can only have an informed

277
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,439
debate if we know more about the impact

278
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:28,019
of algorithms and business models on the

279
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:29,579
entire information landscape it is we

280
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,930
can assume a whole bunch of things there

281
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,790
have been a number of assumptions we

282
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,128
have anecdotal evidence because of good

283
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,620
journalism and because of unfortunately

284
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,350
lots of scandals of the behavior of

285
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,459
Facebook's YouTube's and the like but I

286
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,500
would like to have a much more

287
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:45,000
systematic assessment so that we can

288
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,759
have evidence-based and well-informed

289
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,800
policies I think sorry just add to that

290
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,970
reality and I think that's a really

291
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,199
interesting point and another thing

292
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,970
that's that's really important to

293
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,019
highlight is that and I work in the

294
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,269
technology space and it's funny

295
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,189
sometimes people don't even know they

296
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,630
can't explain when a why a specific ad

297
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,860
is given to a specific person because

298
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,240
it's a case of

299
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,829
she learning is doing it or the ARU

300
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,600
thinks this is the best ad to give to a

301
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,489
person however unfortunately in that

302
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,170
space where sometimes right now there's

303
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,820
a big question of a transparency of all

304
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,099
these algorithms these these these

305
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,180
different processes and unfortunately if

306
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,620
the case when it comes to machine

307
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,420
learning sometimes people are like okay

308
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,100
well the Machine says this is the best

309
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,410
decision to see machines is this is what

310
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,209
art we should use the target therefore

311
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,290
that's kind of it we kind of believe the

312
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,399
machine and that's really a big

313
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,199
challenge we face you know where people

314
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,370
are trying to fight much more for

315
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,410
transparency when it comes to these

316
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,970
algorithms when it comes to AI when it

317
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,860
comes to these various processes because

318
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,480
for some of these businesses they just

319
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,860
actually don't know the reason why

320
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,690
specific things are being targeted

321
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,459
specific people but it's a bit like okay

322
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,810
this is what we have determined that

323
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,399
they want so this is it this is

324
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:50,729
therefore based on the machine what we

325
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:52,800
will give them if you're if you're

326
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,110
optimizing machine learning processes

327
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,329
for profits then that may be at odds

328
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,610
with optimizing them for democracy or if

329
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:02,810
there may be a hot topic these days

330
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,459
discrimination creeping in perhaps

331
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,050
unintended ly yeah but still illegally

332
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,060
and so I think we have to be very

333
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,250
vigilant on all those levels and I agree

334
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,529
it's it's not necessarily reassuring for

335
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,529
me when I talked about security

336
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:18,779
researchers or coders of AI and whatnot

337
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,160
when they say well you may want us to

338
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,140
tell you what machine learning is gonna

339
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,939
lead to but we don't even know and

340
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,130
that's why we like it and I'm kind of

341
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,699
like yeah I get it but you know we

342
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,860
cannot just have unlimited risk and

343
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:36,060
unlimited unintended consequences just

344
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:40,070
because computer says no indeed yeah one

345
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,849
phrase caught my ear and this was that

346
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,839
currently people get the information

347
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,209
they want and not necessarily the

348
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,100
information they need this brings to

349
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:52,920
mind actually the concept of information

350
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,779
security and regulating the information

351
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,519
that the people get whether it's the one

352
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:02,010
one that they want or the one that they

353
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:05,550
need and this makes one question a bit

354
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,769
whether the democratic nations are now

355
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,959
slipping into the playground of the

356
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:12,660
so-called theater called information

357
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,880
security and starting to regulate

358
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,769
content instead of code

359
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,509
something that has been long been said

360
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,970
that this is something that we don't do

361
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:23,790
we never do that is this the way to go

362
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,319
should we go this way please somebody

363
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,259
anybody who has ideas right now heard

364
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:34,740
what wasn't when I visit China they

365
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:37,740
basically say to me now you see what we

366
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,589
mean this is what you get when you have

367
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,690
a free exchange of ideas you get what

368
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:47,490
the chaos of 2016 okay and I say I don't

369
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,850
have a good answer for that

370
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:54,930
I am totally conflicted about that I am

371
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,579
terrified of the consequences of giving

372
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,888
up the First Amendment in the United

373
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:03,810
States I'm also terrified now with the

374
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:06,660
consequences of keeping it and I I'm

375
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,880
totally conflicted about it so so maybe

376
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,009
a European perspective a perspective

377
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:25,589
both from the you and the well it's like

378
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:28,259
you all right now I think this is this

379
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,810
is a very important point and we I often

380
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,360
when we have discussions about any form

381
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:36,540
of legislation I often get accused of

382
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,660
you want to regulate the Internet right

383
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,189
but when we could propose on anything

384
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,920
else we don't necessarily get accused of

385
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:46,349
regulating Society or regulating the

386
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,540
economy normally it's about preventing

387
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,009
fraud or ensuring fair competition or

388
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,719
ensuring non-discrimination or

389
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,139
protecting the freedom of expression

390
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,910
through legislation so the way I think

391
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,459
about it is that if there are laws

392
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,500
offline and this really differs a great

393
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,770
deal in different European countries you

394
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,390
know you have for example hate speech

395
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,720
laws in a number of countries in some

396
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,610
countries you cannot deny the Holocaust

397
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,520
some specific exceptions to far-reaching

398
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,928
freedom of expression guarantees and if

399
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,069
we want to make sure that this is also

400
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,380
ensured on the Internet

401
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,379
then I think regulation may be a

402
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,360
solution at times and while I'm very

403
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,100
sensitive to the question of our

404
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,969
governments going to tell what people

405
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,530
need to hear

406
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,870
I think we should also be equally

407
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,030
critical of a Mark Zuckerberg

408
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,750
determining what people need to hear so

409
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,190
the idea that on the internet without

410
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:43,090
regulation freedom of expression is

411
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,620
optimal for the freedoms is a notion

412
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,330
that I would like to strongly challenge

413
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,520
I think that information is already

414
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,530
highly regulated but for commercial

415
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,930
purposes and it is definitely norm

416
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,500
setting it is definitely norm setting if

417
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,690
for commercial reasons or or just Terms

418
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,550
of Use it is decided that certain

419
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,800
information should be demoted or even

420
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,960
not not be viewed then then you get

421
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,520
effectively by reaching hundreds of

422
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,770
millions if not billions of people a

423
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,510
norm that this information you know

424
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,060
should or should not be in the public so

425
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,620
I'm a classical liberal I believe very

426
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,500
much in the freedom of expression but I

427
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,989
think sometimes to ensure freedoms

428
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,700
regulations are legitimate completely

429
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,170
grand I think that to be very honest I

430
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm a strong believer that more needs to

431
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,240
be done by the social media companies

432
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,920
simply because we have a really big

433
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,440
problem now where stuff is happening

434
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,260
online especially in some of the social

435
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,790
media companies context and let's say

436
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,660
everyone knows this is incorrect

437
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,340
everyone knows this shouldn't be

438
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,870
happening a government go to a social

439
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,000
media company and say can you do

440
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,350
something about this those may come to

441
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,910
say oh we're doing what we can but

442
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,370
that's kind of it for now and we have

443
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,990
this really weird off balance or really

444
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,429
really imbalance I should say where

445
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,510
social media companies are pushing back

446
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,190
the government's and saying actually we

447
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,750
won't do that or actually we can't do

448
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,540
that and it's really speaking earlier

449
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,790
about the current situation in the US

450
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,520
with the I can never remember her name

451
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,409
the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi

452
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,389
and that's really a really really

453
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,780
interesting scenario because we have a

454
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,940
video that's clearly been slowed down to

455
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,629
make this person look incoherent and

456
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,440
some people even claim look drunk and

457
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,880
apparently what's happened is that you

458
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,230
know someone has gone to Facebook and

459
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,200
said hey you need to remove this video

460
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,700
because this is clearly this is Kerry

461
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,410
I've been manipulated it's clearly been

462
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,330
changed it's clearly kind of setting you

463
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,580
know people are viewing this video as it

464
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,439
shouldn't have been viewed and it's been

465
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,179
shared millions of times and Facebook is

466
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,020
saying actually no we won't take that

467
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,250
down because of freedom of speech we're

468
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,710
in that space and it's a very very

469
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,130
dangerous space to begin so I think that

470
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,570
really really

471
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,800
more needs to be done in this in this

472
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,629
context especially with problems like

473
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,220
this where that message is being spread

474
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,280
people are kind of taking certain views

475
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,190
but the reality is let's be frank most

476
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,170
people these days go to social media for

477
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,120
news people don't go to you know the

478
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,080
traditional media anymore Allyson in the

479
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,669
West people already go to the

480
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,860
traditional media anymore people go to

481
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,660
social media so it's a really really big

482
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,100
problem we're facing where if the social

483
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,050
media companies are not doing much about

484
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,820
this problem and we have people going to

485
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,370
switch media for the news what impact

486
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,960
this happened on democracy and turn

487
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,270
about the decision-making issues and I

488
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,460
won't even touch on vaccinations the the

489
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,910
issue that you described is even worse

490
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,000
than you proposed then you've depicted

491
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,250
it that's comforting it's not just that

492
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,380
Facebook didn't want to take a it put it

493
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,600
put it up and it put warnings all over

494
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,960
and people still went to win yeah and it

495
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,080
still forward yeah yeah yeah and so well

496
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,490
it is a big story and so so perhaps the

497
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,139
fact that there is now vigorous debate

498
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,900
about it can lead to better inform

499
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,910
policies because the point is I

500
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,830
understand conceptually that a company

501
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,710
when it gets an ad hoc request to take

502
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:55,120
something down is skeptical and I hope

503
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:57,160
that to to avoid sort of having to deal

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,020
with each and every case including you

505
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,240
know whether far-right

506
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,550
nationalism should should have accounts

507
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:09,760
and should be able to pontificate about

508
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:11,430
you know some some Nazi type population

509
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,650
theories on these social media platforms

510
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,630
buying ads against them etc these

511
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,400
discussions are very valid but I believe

512
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,410
it is high time that we have a systemic

513
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,180
approach to it that is predictable that

514
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,060
is accountable that is transparent

515
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,950
because otherwise you are going to keep

516
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,370
having ad hoc decisions that need to be

517
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:33,010
made there can be accusations of bias

518
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,649
which we're hearing more and more from

519
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,379
from the far right in our country there

520
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,270
they're suggesting that the social media

521
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,260
platforms are sort of belonging to the

522
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:46,030
leftist Church which is a bad thing from

523
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,860
their point of view and certainly this

524
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,020
kind of bias on along political lines

525
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,979
would complicate this discussion even

526
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,530
further so we need predictable and

527
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,700
preferably even legal say

528
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,440
cars that are the same for everybody

529
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,630
whether you're far right far left

530
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,380
whether you're a company or person

531
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,300
well the III agree I that's a desirable

532
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,840
outcome is there's no question about

533
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,460
that

534
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,730
my problem is twofold one is that when

535
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,810
you apply something in an even-handed

536
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,970
way as you just described the people

537
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:24,090
who's who don't like it are going to

538
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,310
complain about bias okay and so and

539
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,139
you'll wind up in this bit in the same

540
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,270
situation here so I've I don't know how

541
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,560
to deal with with that particular

542
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:36,810
problem so the second thing is I don't

543
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,600
actually think it's possible to come to

544
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,210
some sort of objective standard Lalo's

545
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,340
for the more I study this it's more and

546
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,320
more like I the definition of

547
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,120
pornography which in the words of a row

548
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,220
of a Supreme Court justice in the United

549
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,260
States I can't define it but I know it

550
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,140
when I see it that's not very helpful

551
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,050
for legislation or any kind of a

552
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,580
regulatory framework but that is the

553
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,320
best that in some sense the United

554
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,409
States at least the United States has

555
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,250
been able to do if you if if the EU can

556
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,590
do better we'd love to learn about that

557
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,660
well I can't pretend to speak for the EU

558
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:17,100
though I would love to but I think we

559
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:20,190
can find some some routes of solutions

560
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,429
in notions of impersonating difference

561
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,010
between clear satire and you know

562
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,350
framing someone in a different way

563
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,300
because I've seen manipulated video for

564
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,370
satire purposes which I think you know

565
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,760
none of us would be interested in in

566
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,770
banning so the context is importance the

567
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,350
impact is important and I'm I'm

568
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,480
convinced that we can find a set of

569
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,980
solutions that are even-handed

570
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,170
predictable and that can also be

571
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,930
challenged I mean I've had a video of my

572
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:53,130
parliamentary intervention taken down by

573
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:55,380
YouTube clearly political speech I put

574
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,930
it on ironically Twitter and within a

575
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,930
couple of hours Google called me because

576
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,580
they were not too happy with the

577
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,590
advertisements of their unwarranted

578
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,899
takedowns but the point is that not

579
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,919
everybody gets a call that easily from a

580
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,480
tech company if their content is

581
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,280
can down and you also need to have

582
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,470
avenues to challenge it you need

583
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,300
oversight and I don't want to see sort

584
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,850
of privatized law enforcement of speech

585
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,230
either so I agree it's complicated but

586
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,699
I'm sure that we can get there and it

587
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,790
would be good to think broadly and not

588
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,500
ad-hoc incidents by incidents and I hope

589
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,810
that the tech companies Facebook is

590
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,860
already now such are going to ask for

591
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,990
regulation because they're gonna

592
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,879
understand that for them to be the

593
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,400
arbiters of truth is also extremely

594
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,800
uncomfortable place to be my own view of

595
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,880
their Facebook's asking for regulation

596
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,409
is that they know that it's a hopeless

597
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,780
process I don't know if you're getting I

598
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:49,030
agree with you it comes down to the

599
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,129
minds of the voters in the end and maybe

600
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:55,629
they're kind of founder estimating them

601
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:58,110
or I've heard that it's not about that

602
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,940
there are lots of people who are kind of

603
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,479
uninformed and pro to manipulation for

604
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,340
this reason but it's that it's so much

605
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,540
easier to find the people that are in

606
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:14,459
fact a bit or uninformed or a bit more

607
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:19,540
easily easily influenced by let's say

608
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:21,190
content of the object polity so what do

609
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,970
you think about that or are there really

610
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,560
so many people who are so so easily

611
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,560
influenced by it or it's just way easier

612
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,540
to find the ones that are I think I mean

613
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,730
if I can just add some Japanese first I

614
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,889
think the reality is that in some

615
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,690
situations yes but I think what we also

616
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,920
have is that there's a lot more known

617
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,720
about people and more people are

618
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,370
interested in not interested in based on

619
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,780
their online presence so I do a fair

620
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,909
amount of research trying to understand

621
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,470
what people post or like about but act

622
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,450
online the information people share

623
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,840
online and the reality is that all of us

624
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,490
all of you have this underlying online /

625
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,169
online presence that some of you might

626
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,430
know something about some of you might

627
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,320
not have no clue about but basically

628
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,510
almost all tech companies are or

629
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,120
companies online they create a presence

630
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,950
is created for you and that presents

631
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,219
basically tries to understand as much as

632
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,720
you are much about you as possible to be

633
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,720
able to try to target in various ways

634
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,720
let's be frank about this right these

635
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,080
days especially in in the West digital

636
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,860
advertising is massive if you can target

637
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,610
people online and you can if you can

638
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:29,860
musical personalized messages this blows

639
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,990
television advertising and newspaper

640
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,020
advertising over the water so the point

641
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,970
is Lester from certain companies

642
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,710
perspective let's try to find a month as

643
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,270
much about people as possible therefore

644
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,980
we know what they're interested in we

645
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,270
know what their political bias is we

646
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,250
know what they're you know what they do

647
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,929
at night and almost watching they know

648
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,460
everything as much as possible so that

649
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:49,990
they can then target you know

650
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,700
traditionally this has been targeting

651
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,210
about you know what what clothes to buy

652
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,320
what what shows to watch but no what

653
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,809
I've seen especially if they kind of

654
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,189
camera down in this situation it's more

655
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,110
about trying to influence your views no

656
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,640
okay who is actually borderline in their

657
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,229
political views based on what they have

658
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,270
posted or what they're saying online or

659
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,830
the profile we've created for them okay

660
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,850
if we know they're bored lay maybe there

661
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,408
are the actually ones that can be

662
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,689
targeted with certain ads certain

663
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:16,299
certain videos certain terms of her

664
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,179
messages and that's the reality so it's

665
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:20,830
a case of as part of yes certain people

666
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,450
can be influenced but the reality is

667
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,039
that there's a sis online presence

668
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,169
this online profile that we all have

669
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,658
that actually lets certain companies

670
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,460
certain organizations know which people

671
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:34,600
actually might be more likely to be

672
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:37,929
influenced than not the other thing I'd

673
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,899
point out here is that you ask is that

674
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:43,150
numbers really so large when election

675
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,460
when electorates are evenly divided

676
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,830
small differences even small differences

677
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,169
that are a lot yeah yeah yeah yeah I

678
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,939
think that was clearly proven that small

679
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,799
amount of people can have a big impact

680
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,350
with the whole new outbreak of measles

681
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,210
right I mean the vast majority of people

682
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,559
are vaccinating their kids they're

683
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,659
convinced that this is the right thing

684
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,700
to do but then only a small number of

685
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:05,230
people might be convinced including

686
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,840
through disinformation that they find

687
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,090
online that they should question the

688
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,889
doctors same way that people can be

689
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,240
convinced to question authority question

690
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,880
politicians question journalists

691
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,039
question everything and this questioning

692
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,799
everything and being confused and sort

693
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:23,158
of tuning out I believe is a much much

694
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,370
broader goal than simply convincing

695
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,730
online

696
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,830
readers of you know one reality or

697
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,020
another so there's a lot of assessment

698
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,460
about you know Artie and Sputnik and and

699
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:40,760
kind of different versions of events and

700
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,220
I believe it's not as much an effort to

701
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,710
try to convince you of something that

702
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,140
can be proven to be false but rather to

703
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,600
get people to check out to question

704
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,670
everything I hear it around me people

705
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,459
that are well-informed generally let's

706
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,560
say you know these days everything is so

707
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,850
negative when I look online you know I I

708
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,690
really don't know what to believe

709
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,300
anymore

710
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,240
I don't watch the news anymore I'm just

711
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,700
going to do other things and clearly a

712
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,040
democracy without participation is in a

713
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,870
bad shape so this broader agenda of

714
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,649
eroding trust in liberal democracy

715
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,870
itself creating confusion is an agenda

716
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:20,660
in and of itself irrespective of which

717
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,520
fact quote unquote you believe or don't

718
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,750
believe I think this this this measles

719
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,580
or a situation is really interesting

720
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,320
especially for that because what we've

721
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,949
seen from me from akin about online

722
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,320
misinformation lets a campaign is that

723
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,800
there's been post on both sides of the

724
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,629
fence

725
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,850
so this was a discussion that you know

726
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,110
was long long buried long time ago but

727
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,540
all of a sudden now you have not only

728
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,580
Pro messages or cannibal gates messages

729
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,470
but the opposite side so no there's kind

730
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,030
of this fabricated discussion actually

731
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,200
being created which has four just like

732
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,670
you said it's forced people into

733
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,810
thinking about all actually is this an

734
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,780
issue I didn't recognize this as an

735
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,860
issue or iPod to check this out more and

736
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,330
that's really interesting because you

737
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,219
know before you were to potentially have

738
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,080
all messages saying one thing that's

739
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,390
kind of coherent message oh this person

740
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,919
is bad vote for this other person no

741
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,080
it's a situation where it's all about

742
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,270
confusion getting people to think or

743
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,220
question questions things that they had

744
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,389
known for a long time which maybe no

745
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,920
they're not sure about or maybe they

746
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,900
need to go and check so this is gonna

747
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,460
it's a very very interesting campaign

748
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,460
especially this this Mises or break

749
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,650
sensation cells kind of stuff I mean

750
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,450
it's the reality I mean if EVs news

751
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,460
newspapers and leads from the online

752
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,710
sphere I mean if something gets a lot of

753
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,690
hits on Twitter a lot of likes on

754
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,580
Facebook a lot of likes a lot of

755
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,320
searches first of all it becomes more

756
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,658
popular but second of all journalists

757
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,158
may think ooh there's a story here so

758
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,879
there is a real incentive to at least

759
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,739
suggest scale and clearly I mean I I

760
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:47,599
often like to think about it with this

761
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:48,830
this metaphor so let's imagine we just

762
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,200
heard an applause right in the other

763
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,759
room did you hear that okay so let's

764
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,759
imagine we hear it again and we hear you

765
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,409
know yelling and a lot of enthusiasm and

766
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,029
we know that a politician was giving a

767
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:00,470
speech there so we're curious you know

768
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,729
who is this person what were they

769
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,029
talking about who is this

770
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:06,619
this arousing person who is so popular

771
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,599
and selling an exciting story and

772
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:11,869
imagine we would open the door and all

773
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:14,629
we would find as a speaker blasting out

774
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:16,099
applause yells it would probably give us

775
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:17,779
a different impression of this person

776
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:21,049
then if the room will be filled with

777
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:22,759
excited engaged individuals and so the

778
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:24,739
notion of bots influencing this

779
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,779
popularity and then the online sphere

780
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:28,159
leading to stories in you know what is

781
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:30,200
called the mainstream media but let's

782
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,049
say you know newspapers radio television

783
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,639
and and everything it's also dynamic

784
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,918
that I think we need to look at more

785
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,258
because the incentives to boost a story

786
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:43,070
online so that that it may go to the

787
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,720
offline media is is a dynamic that I

788
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:48,739
think is fascinating I would love to

789
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,409
know more about there is a fascinating

790
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:53,269
book written by a medium manipulator

791
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,340
I don't forgot in the same but the book

792
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:59,659
the book's title is unforgettable

793
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:02,389
let's go trust me I'm lying and it is a

794
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:04,999
book which describes this interesting

795
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:08,090
synergy between the social media and the

796
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:10,879
traditional media where in which the

797
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,970
tradition this social media operate in

798
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:16,580
exactly the way you say and they rely

799
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,519
and then they rely on the traditional

800
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,379
media to validate a story and and then

801
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,009
that that's what gives it the the broad

802
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:26,418
credibility because what's when one

803
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:28,220
mainstream media some vetted

804
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,169
organization covers it than everybody

805
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,330
else code that all the others cover it

806
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:35,299
and that gives it legitimacy and and now

807
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:37,428
you now what started out as a social

808
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,519
media campaign now becomes quote real

809
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,289
news because the mainstream what if the

810
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,299
popularity online was mostly bought

811
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,039
induced that it you know it what it

812
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,570
doesn't matter that's it's also matter

813
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,200
so that it's definitely a recipe for

814
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,480
success but I think it's it's something

815
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,429
we have to pierce absolutely absolutely

816
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,559
right you know this often the case that

817
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:58,119
these kind of discussions like tend to

818
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,519
prefer the aspects of information

819
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,189
security because they're louder they're

820
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,529
more colorful and the show is there but

821
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,960
the aspects of cybersecurity is actually

822
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:09,999
where the silent battle so-called goes

823
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,179
on so when moving girls slowly in this

824
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:15,509
direction now when I'm thinking about

825
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:18,039
the cybersecurity of elections then

826
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:21,039
sometimes it's also becoming like a very

827
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,350
nebulous term so where does it end does

828
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,690
it end in a mailbox of an election

829
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:29,289
official when we include all the

830
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:34,179
auxiliary system does it end in the

831
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:36,850
central servers or in the Evo ting

832
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,289
machine varies where is the limit where

833
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,809
can we say that it's not anymore

834
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,809
cybersecurity of election security or

835
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,820
there is indeed no limit my personal

836
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,109
opinion is that the the reality we've

837
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,289
sorry for especially we're living in it

838
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:52,239
as we're living in these days is that

839
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:55,059
the Internet is everywhere everyone in

840
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:57,149
here has a mobile phone for sure know

841
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,399
some people even have two mobile phones

842
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:03,008
or three different you never know and

843
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,018
the reality is that the point of cyber

844
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,190
is that cyber II and this is actually

845
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,929
happening with the Internet think so

846
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,579
since one of the talks yesterday and the

847
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:11,770
reality with the Internet of Things is

848
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:14,049
that the the point is to have a sense

849
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,839
for everywhere to a lot of people to be

850
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:18,399
tracked a low efficiency in terms of

851
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,799
buildings all all this kind of stuff

852
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,279
autonomous car is that the point is if

853
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:26,049
it comes to cyber is that slavery is

854
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,549
everywhere with elections of

855
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:29,290
cybersecurity of Elections is the same

856
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:31,418
thing and it's really important to be as

857
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,940
comprehensive as possible so it is the

858
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:35,649
servers which these days actually the

859
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,960
majority of the actual focus especially

860
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,578
from academic perspective is how do we

861
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,750
secure the server's how do we ensure

862
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,159
they're always available how do we

863
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,440
ensure that when someone wants to vote

864
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,700
that they can vote right that and that

865
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,559
is really default to be frank that's the

866
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:50,469
focus when it comes to academia values

867
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:53,139
in from a computers perspective but the

868
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,178
reality is as we are seeing no voters

869
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,339
are very important ok the minds of

870
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,220
voters ok that's that's also important

871
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:02,020
we're seeing candidates are very

872
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,399
important because ok if you can't go

873
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,000
after if you don't have the money or the

874
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,610
resources

875
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,300
go after voters because that's a massive

876
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,830
campaign the focus on candidates because

877
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,550
as you were mentioning before candidates

878
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,080
are you know I have this really

879
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,550
difficult challenge should I really

880
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,830
really be put my security and then have

881
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:20,020
no money to try to actually reach out to

882
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,430
prospective voters or should I spend my

883
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,100
money on voters and try to actually get

884
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,770
into power and do something good so the

885
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,630
real challenge and the reality is from

886
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,100
my perspective cyber doesn't doesn't end

887
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,050
anywhere it's kind of everywhere and

888
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,270
especially these days when we have some

889
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,400
systems for example even Estonia where

890
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,990
you can vote online now that's really

891
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,980
interesting problem and I did some

892
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,930
research on that it's a real estate

893
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,240
problem because you can vote from you

894
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,120
can of course both on your computers you

895
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,830
can use mobile phone is also a reality

896
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,210
you can post you can send your full in

897
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,830
you can actually turn upon the deer you

898
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,690
can vote by ballot all this kind of

899
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:54,670
stuff you can do but the reality is and

900
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,050
the challenge always is but what if

901
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,480
actually there is a malware on the

902
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,100
computer that's being used to vote well

903
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,630
if there's a malware on the let's assume

904
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,040
that the server is secure if there's

905
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,260
malware on the computer a malware on the

906
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,490
phone all these things are potential

907
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,530
challenges so it's a very difficult

908
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,270
thing to draw the line and say oh

909
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,920
they'll only protect servers or and

910
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,210
we'll have some observers in and then

911
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,580
we'll check that everything looks good

912
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,350
and also the reality is when it comes to

913
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,299
some server systems transparency is a

914
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,650
big issue and the reason why I believe

915
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,960
that a lot of countries actually haven't

916
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,710
switched to onlay voting is because

917
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,810
they're very very worried about

918
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,700
transparency very very worried about

919
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,590
actually being sure the vote that I cast

920
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,859
is actually the vote as recorded on the

921
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:34,690
board as comforted right but the reality

922
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,620
is especially the kind of level of

923
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,450
technical systems that we're having

924
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,279
today is very important to have that

925
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,419
transparency and if it's very difficult

926
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,530
to have that transparent and there some

927
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,390
people might not actually be keen on

928
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,560
voting on life because it's a very very

929
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,089
difficult thing to prove is very

930
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
difficult thing to be sure about but you

931
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,450
can be much more sure I mean you know

932
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,820
everyone probably agree current voting

933
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,620
systems have their own issues but people

934
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,000
are comfortable with them everyone knows

935
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,740
you know if you want to vote you get

936
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,300
your vote you go into the box you drop

937
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,580
it you come up we drop it in and that's

938
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,140
it when it comes to taking out your

939
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,150
phone and maybe voting online and

940
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,500
pressing a candidate who knows whether

941
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,730
your vote was counted or not it's a very

942
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,920
very difficult thing and that's that's

943
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,810
kind of a mind change thing but that

944
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,890
also in my pain is part of cybersecurity

945
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,890
of the elections

946
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:20,720
I want two buildings and make that you

947
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:25,070
that you said earlier that you drew the

948
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,439
distinction between the the machines and

949
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:30,620
the and the voters and the minds of the

950
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,390
and the minds of the voters I and I I

951
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,799
thought that that distinction was really

952
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:38,299
important because the best machine and

953
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,120
best measures to protect machine

954
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,070
security do nothing to protect the mind

955
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,920
of the voter yeah and so you can talk

956
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:48,230
thing about election security as a cyber

957
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,080
component and an ANA mental

958
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,700
psychological person informational

959
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,470
component or you could just call

960
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,330
everything siren I think calling

961
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,660
everything cyber is the wrong way to do

962
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,850
it

963
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,120
but because of the distinctive that you

964
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,620
want to do associated with this approach

965
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,720
that you just mentioned we're calling

966
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,549
everything cyber yeah because then you

967
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,040
start thinking that's traditional cyber

968
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,960
security measures help protect the minds

969
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,700
of the voter and they don't yeah yeah

970
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,340
and the real challenge we're facing

971
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,359
I mean I engage with it so a lot of my

972
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,860
research is actually focused on the

973
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,270
human aspects of cyber security right

974
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,070
and it's a very big challenge that I

975
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,450
face because men you go and speak to

976
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,100
someone about security especially if

977
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,930
they tell someone I'm this is half of so

978
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,460
many times I go to introduce myself to

979
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,560
someone and I say I'm you know I'm Jason

980
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,070
nurse I do cybersecurity research or

981
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,930
you're cartographer no oh you do

982
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,500
technical security you you you code all

983
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,589
day long

984
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,210
not quite I focus on human aspects of

985
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,410
security I care about people's minds and

986
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:46,310
why people fall for phishing attacks

987
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:47,629
that's security I kid you not and that's

988
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,920
the reality kind of people have this

989
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,830
problem when you tell people's security

990
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,960
that it's kind of I'm a techie I'm

991
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,540
traditionally I'm traditionally trained

992
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,180
as a technologist but I want to get away

993
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,410
from computers clearly computers as much

994
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,250
as possible because I really believe

995
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,899
that these days

996
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,390
the real challenge isn't kind of

997
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,950
securing the technology per se it's kind

998
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,410
of more to help people engage with the

999
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,600
technology and also people and people

1000
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,830
themselves because because attackers are

1001
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,680
recognized in cyber criminals are

1002
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,480
recognizing actually the technology is

1003
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,950
really hard to break these days because

1004
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,040
people have been doing it for you know

1005
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:24,799
so many years the individuals that use

1006
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,990
the technology they're much more easy

1007
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,810
attack platform they're much more

1008
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,549
exposed there

1009
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,790
we're likely to believe when you send

1010
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,260
them an email saying you know and if you

1011
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,990
click this link I'll give you a million

1012
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,820
pounds yeah sure okay that what's the

1013
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,379
risk here if I click the link or

1014
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,730
something bad will happen but even is

1015
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,050
even interesting you know if you got as

1016
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:46,170
people there's a firewall protect you

1017
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:50,640
from every potential attack half the

1018
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:52,470
people will say yes no it doesn't but

1019
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,660
that's the reality and I'm not kind of

1020
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,220
making Josephine Bazemore the relative

1021
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,540
there's a massive educational component

1022
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,310
there's a massive people and people's

1023
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,110
mind component and this is very

1024
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,940
important election security because it

1025
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,610
is where the battle is focusing on

1026
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,870
though maybe just a slightly different

1027
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,080
point because I think this is very

1028
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:11,870
interesting but another element that we

1029
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,090
may want to look at more is the

1030
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:17,549
challenge between especially digitized

1031
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,230
processes of elections being outsourced

1032
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,630
to private companies but the

1033
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,880
accountability remaining for the public

1034
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,670
so let me give you a very concrete

1035
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,320
example from Kenya where I indeed was

1036
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,930
the EU chief observer in 2017 where we

1037
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,490
could fill a whole day talking about

1038
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,660
technology democracy and what happened

1039
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:40,290
there but I want to zoom in on one

1040
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,270
specific element which is there was an

1041
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,940
election and there was a challenge to

1042
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:48,680
the results basically somebody was

1043
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,690
saying there was a manipulation hacking

1044
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:55,049
of the of the servers and there has been

1045
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:57,140
an altering of the vote count and the

1046
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,970
Supreme Court of Kenya imagined and

1047
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,160
asked for an opening and an audit of the

1048
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,959
servers but the servers were in the

1049
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,500
hands of a private company and the

1050
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,420
private company was not able to provide

1051
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,520
this audit in due time

1052
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,590
therefore the Supreme Court of Kenya

1053
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,060
concluded that it could not be excluded

1054
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,400
that there have been manipulation

1055
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,310
because the absence of manipulation

1056
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,000
could not be verified and recalled the

1057
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:26,490
presidential elections these are massive

1058
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,490
consequences of accountability towards

1059
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:32,580
the public but proprietary access for a

1060
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,919
private sector company and and in a in a

1061
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,540
strange way I think for a long time the

1062
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,180
lack of trust because you know

1063
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,529
foundation of trust cannot be or a lack

1064
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,669
of foundation of trust cannot be

1065
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,140
replaced by technology

1066
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,269
think that's clear I mean in the

1067
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,700
Netherlands we vote on a piece of paper

1068
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,288
but at the end of the day there's not

1069
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,089
one person sitting in a room with all

1070
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,920
those pieces of paper they are

1071
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,029
aggregated in Excel sheets or whatnot

1072
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,849
maybe slightly more sophisticated

1073
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:59,220
programs and so it gets digitized at

1074
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,440
some points in the process and actually

1075
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,680
recently during elections there had been

1076
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,349
a little batch of votes uncounted so a

1077
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,990
few days after the the elections the

1078
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:13,410
electoral body reported this and there

1079
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:15,509
was no fuss no fuss at all and it's

1080
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,640
probably because one the numbers were

1081
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:20,099
too small to alter the results but to

1082
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,400
because there's a general trust in our

1083
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:25,170
societies we trust our election

1084
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,119
committee and you know people didn't

1085
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,579
didn't go into the streets they didn't

1086
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,220
fear that there had been fraud even in

1087
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,630
the recent years if if any such thing

1088
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,359
would happen in a country like Kenya

1089
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,430
where the basic trust in authorities the

1090
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,619
basic trust between institutions is

1091
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,419
fundamentally absent you know there

1092
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,279
would immediately be concerned and so

1093
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,140
because of a lack of trust there's been

1094
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:48,690
a lot of push to go from paper ballots

1095
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,618
to digitized systems that's the irony I

1096
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:55,380
think of the whole story no because

1097
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:57,569
because traditionally in large parts of

1098
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,519
the world voter fraud happened by ballot

1099
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:01,619
stuffing so people associate pieces of

1100
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,348
paper with manipulation and trucks full

1101
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,960
of you know pre-printed ballots with

1102
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,579
with marks and everything and now so

1103
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,650
much is digitized but it presents a

1104
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,150
whole bunch of new risks in an

1105
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,250
environment where sometimes legal

1106
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,460
protections are entirely absent so let

1107
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:19,109
me conclude with one more example which

1108
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,890
is that in the country of Kenya there

1109
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:26,069
are no data protection laws so while

1110
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,990
people's registration for the elections

1111
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:30,799
and the processing of all this data is

1112
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:34,049
happening their rights are not protected

1113
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:36,000
which also means that as observers we

1114
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:38,130
can't assess whether the practice meets

1115
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,859
the legal requirements because there is

1116
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:43,680
no legal requirement and so you get into

1117
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:45,960
a whole different landscape when the

1118
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,910
basic trust is lacking and when people

1119
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,990
rely heavily on technology especially

1120
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,609
private-sector technology without the

1121
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,830
foundations or without the possibilities

1122
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,380
for oversight and

1123
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,240
clearly the public accountability leads

1124
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,120
for the price being paid of any failure

1125
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,600
to land on the public side it's very

1126
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:10,850
interesting yeah very interesting yeah

1127
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:12,440
it's a case study to be investigated in

1128
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,420
some regards I can understand it simply

1129
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,110
because it really depends on the country

1130
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:20,360
and I think if if a certain country this

1131
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:33,740
this might sound bad but you know I

1132
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:37,670
trust you all go back I want to

1133
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:41,240
underscore what you said about the

1134
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:44,090
importance of trust and just just to

1135
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,979
point out that that is it's the

1136
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:48,350
undermining of trust that is the

1137
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,420
objective of the of the enemies and

1138
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:52,610
democracy that is what they try to they

1139
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,910
try to undermine the institutions that

1140
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:59,330
provide continuity and Trust journalism

1141
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:03,170
universities government and so on and

1142
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:05,420
and that's really the the hard part

1143
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,460
about this which is that it's very it

1144
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,530
takes a long time to build up trust it's

1145
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:17,630
very easy to destroy it yes oh yes yeah

1146
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:19,670
now it's also been often emphasized that

1147
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,610
the very grounds of our system our

1148
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,970
system that is equally chastised and

1149
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:28,390
praised his is trust Jason when you did

1150
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:31,580
your study into the procedures safety

1151
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,740
security safeguards in s to deny voting

1152
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,940
then what about the role of trust there

1153
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,410
is it the mainly trust based system

1154
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,270
personally I think it was a from what

1155
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,339
from what we found and in our research

1156
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,590
it was a DC makeup kind of firm

1157
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,540
primarily trust trust based system and

1158
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,940
it was really interesting because when

1159
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:53,240
we did the work we were you know I stood

1160
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,310
here is you know so if a country when it

1161
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,470
comes to online voting I mean it's it's

1162
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,850
literally incredible but from what we

1163
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,350
found actually a lot of it is actually

1164
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:03,110
based on the fact that the Estonian

1165
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,839
people actually trust the online voting

1166
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,320
system and it's it's it goes back to

1167
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,970
this issue before of

1168
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,620
Semmy Trust is very important and this

1169
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,850
trust has built up over a period of time

1170
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,900
and gradually there are actually been

1171
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,819
increases in the amount of people

1172
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,890
actually voting online and it's really

1173
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,120
really significant when we did the work

1174
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:22,140
we found a number of different things

1175
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,250
some good some not so great but what

1176
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,170
what was really interesting from the

1177
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,570
Estonia balloon system is that some of

1178
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:28,950
the components are procedural as

1179
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,420
something running on kind of strict

1180
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,100
procedures and we're how things are done

1181
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,900
some of them are much more technical

1182
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,610
since we did that work is actually moved

1183
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,770
forward a bit to be much a bit more on

1184
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,260
the technical side but from what we saw

1185
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,730
it trust was extremely important and

1186
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,830
Trust is one of the big reasons actually

1187
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,070
making the the I voting system in

1188
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:49,350
Estonia what it is I highly doubt that

1189
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,000
the system here could just be taken and

1190
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,520
adapted to another country even at the

1191
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,780
same size don't think it would work

1192
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,420
Estonia as a country is extremely

1193
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,890
digital literally is brilliant I love

1194
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,100
technology and when they come here it's

1195
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:04,350
amazing but other countries are not like

1196
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,910
that so I think the the ann-marie did

1197
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,529
the work it was very clear Estonian case

1198
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,230
is really really interesting it really

1199
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,670
really works in terms of devoting other

1200
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,800
countries they wouldn't stand a chance

1201
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:17,190
implementing it the trust isn't there in

1202
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,780
in in technology and also if Estonian

1203
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,060
one thing that was really really good to

1204
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,380
see was the fact that because of the

1205
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,480
size of the country because of the

1206
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,340
flexibilities agility it can actually

1207
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,290
properly deal with issues that come up

1208
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,030
and not actually kind of ensure that the

1209
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,120
population is certain a certain level of

1210
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,010
digital literacy when it comes to cyber

1211
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,630
or not where for some other country

1212
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,340
especially much bigger countries you

1213
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,500
know is a very very big challenge to

1214
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,510
actually push for it national security

1215
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,100
awareness campaigns get people to think

1216
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,990
about links before they click them get

1217
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,490
people to understand what malware is and

1218
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,990
why they should care get with a

1219
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,779
thinkable entering credit card details

1220
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,950
online and check insights first these

1221
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,150
are really big challenges but these are

1222
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,560
challenges I can invest in how to

1223
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,690
overcome simply because of how the

1224
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,480
system is set up how flexible it is and

1225
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,370
how well and how much actually there

1226
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,690
certain people actually have built trust

1227
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,029
in the system this goes back to what her

1228
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,490
buzz thing it trust is very hard to

1229
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,630
build but when it is there you kind of

1230
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,549
really have to kind of him you don't

1231
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:13,080
have to hit it hard sometimes but if you

1232
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,210
hit it in the right place it will fall

1233
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,680
along but it won't happen that's part I

1234
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,980
fully agree but I think we need to

1235
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,940
distinguish between sort of verifiable

1236
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,650
procedures yeah and

1237
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,630
general sense of trust in institutions

1238
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,089
and everything and and when it comes to

1239
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,099
election specifically clearly

1240
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:31,680
verification is crucial whether it's in

1241
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:35,520
a backup system for digital vote or

1242
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,828
paper voting or whatever and I think we

1243
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,630
should go on the basis of you know trust

1244
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:42,060
but verify yeah no of course of course I

1245
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,530
mean the reality is and what was what

1246
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,180
was actually very happy to see based on

1247
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,430
the work that I done that I did a few

1248
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,509
years back and since then they have

1249
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,950
actually moved much more forward

1250
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,170
verification and formal verification

1251
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:57,118
who's a much more computational timing

1252
00:48:52,170 --> 00:49:01,170
here but I think you would agree that

1253
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,839
the technical verification is necessary

1254
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,609
was not sufficient in it's not you can't

1255
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,130
buy alone alone you can't do the job

1256
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:11,400
yeah yeah yeah yeah no I mean normally

1257
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:13,140
one of the essential ways to verifies

1258
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,569
that there's multiple media multiple

1259
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,490
formats in which votes are transmitted

1260
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:19,980
for example so there there may be a

1261
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:22,919
transmission of a scan there may then

1262
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,430
also be keying in of the same results

1263
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,859
and then there may also be a paper copy

1264
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:32,368
so that you basically have three counts

1265
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:35,490
that need to all match up yeah so you

1266
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:39,500
definitely need multiple methods also of

1267
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:43,200
verification not just through scanning

1268
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:46,050
but those I included it's a fair comment

1269
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,879
I was making that my point was that the

1270
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,230
the check you you drew the distinction

1271
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,780
which I like

1272
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:53,640
between verify the the sort of

1273
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,589
verifiable procedures and technology and

1274
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,509
so on and the generalized institutional

1275
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:59,970
trust and I agree that they're separate

1276
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:01,230
my point is that one doesn't substitute

1277
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,609
for the other oh absolutely

1278
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,950
sorry then I didn't right yeah you're

1279
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:06,839
absolutely right no can't and technology

1280
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,520
can never substrate trust either that's

1281
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:10,740
the point and I think sometimes it is

1282
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,050
the hope that people have that

1283
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:16,229
especially in developing countries where

1284
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:18,060
you know the the legacy systems were so

1285
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,790
fraud that they hope that maybe a

1286
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,299
computer can sort of safeguard them but

1287
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:26,369
even if you know all the steps go well

1288
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,280
until the very very end if anyone is

1289
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:31,400
able to manipulate the final counts then

1290
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,200
you can still with with the simple

1291
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,990
manipulation in fact the entire outcomes

1292
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,790
so there is no magic bullet for sure and

1293
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,828
everything needs to be protected and

1294
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,480
secured over and over again and for that

1295
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,280
you you also need well-functioning

1296
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,829
institutions checks and balances

1297
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,900
oversights etc etc but what worries mean

1298
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:50,460
the digitization process is that a

1299
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,190
number of these very fundamental

1300
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,650
procedures for democracy are taken out

1301
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:57,510
of the hands essentially of those who

1302
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,130
are accountable for the failures and I

1303
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,540
think this is just like a fundamental

1304
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,670
point that we have to think about also

1305
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:04,619
in our Western democracies I mean the

1306
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,750
whole question what exactly happened in

1307
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:07,950
the United States in 2016 I have to say

1308
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,150
I'm not studying it every day but I

1309
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:12,359
think there's still many more questions

1310
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:14,099
and answers and perhaps that is also

1311
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:16,440
because some of the key information is

1312
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,480
not in the hands of the public

1313
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,290
authorities that could then submit them

1314
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:25,050
to legal legal procedures this leads me

1315
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:27,300
to a question that does perhaps today is

1316
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:30,150
increasing reliance and technology and

1317
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,130
elections lead to attention with

1318
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,930
constitutional requirements the

1319
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,329
traditional requirements to elections

1320
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,819
like that they are free general uniform

1321
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:42,349
direct and eldest principle of secret

1322
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:47,190
ballot Easter in fact a constitutional

1323
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:50,250
contradiction there or should we be so

1324
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:53,490
rigid in interpreting the general

1325
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:56,190
traditional requirements to elections to

1326
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:00,689
begin with there are many of us who

1327
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:03,270
believe that technology that the that in

1328
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:09,780
an election context new technology isn't

1329
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:14,280
necessarily better and there's an old

1330
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:17,369
saying that there are three roads to

1331
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,349
ruin alcohol is the fastest sex is the

1332
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:31,020
most fun technology is the most certain

1333
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:32,550
I really believe maybe I could bring

1334
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,150
this to another element of this question

1335
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,920
because not all rights and democratic

1336
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,660
procedures are in constitutions

1337
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,339
oftentimes you have fundamental

1338
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,078
principles in a constitution and then an

1339
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:45,210
electoral law that goes much more into

1340
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,470
the details but you know fundamentally

1341
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,359
we we have a challenge with the vast

1342
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:53,000
and rapid development of technologies

1343
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:55,819
and some of the legal details that

1344
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,099
should sort of frame these developments

1345
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:02,390
not being articulated clearly enough so

1346
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:05,060
we we find new cases like let's go back

1347
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:06,830
to the Pelosi video we will see much

1348
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,330
more of this or including deep fakes

1349
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:10,279
where it's much easier to even

1350
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,750
completely pretend that somebody is say

1351
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,160
something that they didn't say so it

1352
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,510
doesn't even look weird or somebody

1353
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,700
doesn't even look drunk in fact they

1354
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,230
look as normal as possible except that

1355
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,980
they never said the words that the video

1356
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:24,380
suggests and so this technology is

1357
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,680
evolving rapidly how do we deal with it

1358
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:31,130
and I hope that we can go to more in a

1359
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,020
way constitutionally spirited principles

1360
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,820
that are articulated and then have

1361
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,710
regulators more empowered to assess

1362
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,300
whether different types of technology

1363
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,040
still respect those principles because

1364
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,440
if we're gonna write law for every

1365
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,450
technology then we're really going to be

1366
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,460
outpaced by their developments

1367
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:49,520
Democratic decision-making is so slow

1368
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:52,369
compared to think technologies for

1369
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,290
instance if you would kindly refresh our

1370
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:55,849
memories test the Netherlands have some

1371
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,920
experience with actually trying to

1372
00:53:55,849 --> 00:54:00,500
implement an online voting system yes

1373
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,720
what was the outcome so we're back to

1374
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,849
paper so maybe that's the the says says

1375
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,098
it all paper and red pencils which is

1376
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:08,710
sometimes challenged somebody once

1377
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:11,930
marked it with a different pen and their

1378
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:15,619
vote on a fairly high level was not

1379
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:18,980
counted or not valid but the point is

1380
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:20,869
the laws protect the rights the

1381
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,930
Democratic rights of people but they

1382
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:25,990
don't always prescribe the media right

1383
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:30,470
so you can you can change you can go

1384
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:32,118
change back to paper as we did if you

1385
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:35,330
want to without having to change the

1386
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:36,859
constitutional or whatever so yeah I

1387
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:39,140
think the Netherlands is a good example

1388
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:43,040
of trying digital and then coming back

1389
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,720
to analogue by choosing so because there

1390
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,180
were a lot of concerns about electronic

1391
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,040
voting and we have quite a few people

1392
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,020
that are technically skilled and that

1393
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,270
just push back and we still have ongoing

1394
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,400
discussions about this also with chip

1395
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:57,560
card for public transport and you know

1396
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,100
the right to privacy for example as well

1397
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,259
so there's a lot of

1398
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,140
push back against digitizing everything

1399
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:06,150
especially when it comes to voting and

1400
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,819
therefore the whole discussions about

1401
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:12,210
the number of signatures to be submitted

1402
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,730
to demand a referendum was was so

1403
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,440
interesting because the level of

1404
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,360
protection of those processes is very

1405
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,670
different from the level of protection

1406
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,410
of the general election infrastructure

1407
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:26,370
and so the verification methods or

1408
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:28,680
perhaps the possibility to impersonate X

1409
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,420
amount of signatures thereby forcing a

1410
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,029
referendum not on the basis of people

1411
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,430
but on the basis of you know fake

1412
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:37,560
signatures or whatnot fake registrations

1413
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:39,930
is something I mean I haven't I haven't

1414
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:44,040
looked at the ins and outs of this but I

1415
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:45,779
think such differences in scrutiny and

1416
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:51,120
protection and the potential for fraud

1417
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:52,950
manipulation hacks whatever is extremely

1418
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,230
important and there should also not be

1419
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:57,540
too much difference between different

1420
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,280
electoral processes so if it's much

1421
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,620
easier to manipulate a referendum than a

1422
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,170
generation you can also run into

1423
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:06,029
problems I think from my perspective is

1424
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,980
especially comes down to the use of

1425
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,990
technology use of technology in variety

1426
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:14,220
of these systems is a massive issue of

1427
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:16,560
exposure of exposure the the more

1428
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:19,290
technology used more expose you become

1429
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,549
but the key thing is here it's not not

1430
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,500
only the more exposed to you've become

1431
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,790
but the more exposed you've become for

1432
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,290
the entire world that might be

1433
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,960
interested in compromising any part of

1434
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:30,029
the process technology is great the

1435
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,580
Internet is great the fundamental

1436
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:34,410
problem of the Internet is that it

1437
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,529
allowed you to be open to access or

1438
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,660
attack from anyone anywhere we live in a

1439
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:41,490
society where you can't go after anyone

1440
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:43,560
anywhere it just doesn't work like that

1441
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:45,509
even if you know exactly who is the

1442
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,490
person in the country that launches

1443
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:50,280
attack against the system the process

1444
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:52,379
whatever it is you can't you can't go

1445
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,720
after them it's not always let's say

1446
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,910
that straightforward so therefore if

1447
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,980
you're opening your society or something

1448
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:03,450
as fundamental as voting as elections to

1449
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,650
potentially attack some the entire world

1450
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,299
that's a big challenge with people

1451
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,600
there's also a big challenge when it

1452
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,130
comes to transparency using these well

1453
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,450
is beyond labels these systems anyone in

1454
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,099
the system the key thing

1455
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,319
you have to be able to do is the bill

1456
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,599
people's trust in it to build this trust

1457
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,250
transparency is very important but

1458
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,440
sometimes it's really really difficult

1459
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,359
so even with the work with them tied to

1460
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,900
a vest Estonia it was really interesting

1461
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:30,690
because Estonia has put a significant

1462
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,589
emphasis in making the voting system as

1463
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:36,930
understandable as possible to the laymen

1464
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:39,750
right and that's really really important

1465
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:41,940
that's the fundamental step if you don't

1466
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,109
do that then people are the trust in

1467
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,550
this system that has just been

1468
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:45,750
implemented it will be like okay well

1469
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,119
what's the system how do I know this is

1470
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:50,400
one messed up my vote or oh and they

1471
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:51,540
have really really emphasized every part

1472
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,550
of the system you can find out more

1473
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,109
detail about it and that's part of

1474
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,150
building trust that's part of this idea

1475
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:58,339
of transparency a transparency is very

1476
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,240
important and it's one of the UM

1477
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:02,279
Constitution rights when it comes to

1478
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,209
voting to democracy transparency is very

1479
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,220
very important and now before I open the

1480
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:11,210
floor for questions and answers just one

1481
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,618
last theme perhaps focus on these

1482
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:15,690
election monitoring and there is just

1483
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:18,030
one concluding question about that

1484
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:20,339
how are election monitoring tools and

1485
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:24,180
practices considering the cyber and

1486
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:26,130
information ax aspects and Easter should

1487
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,250
and could there be some standard

1488
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:32,369
practices or techniques for identifying

1489
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:34,589
and verifying irregularities it comes to

1490
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:36,690
elections monitoring and Merete every I

1491
00:58:34,589 --> 00:58:39,630
would say this is this is currently

1492
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:43,619
nearly impossible because election

1493
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:45,210
observations are very much according to

1494
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:47,910
a methodology at least when they're

1495
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:49,589
according to strong methodologies on the

1496
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:52,259
basis of what you can see with with your

1497
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:53,940
own eyes and then you know you have

1498
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:55,800
people all over the country they stay

1499
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,359
for a longer period shorter period and

1500
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,790
they look at everything not just voting

1501
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,460
day but also are people being paid at

1502
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:04,529
rallies or is the police intimidating

1503
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,170
people are people free to campaign you

1504
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:08,190
know is the effort to register

1505
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,890
even-handed across the country and

1506
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:13,650
everything but the more of these

1507
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:16,379
procedures that happen inside servers

1508
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:18,569
and out of view of anyone's naked eye

1509
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,760
anyone's naked eye not just election

1510
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:22,589
observers but just anyone the more

1511
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,790
difficult it becomes to observe and so

1512
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:28,370
what I think would be useful is to

1513
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,960
start thinking about frameworks at the

1514
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:33,290
beginning of the process that have

1515
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,720
requirements for procurements and public

1516
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:39,080
oversight as I spoke about earlier so

1517
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,370
that at least the procedures and the

1518
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,350
role of governments are clearly

1519
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:44,210
articulated and can then be assessed

1520
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:47,330
whether you know all the actors took

1521
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:51,920
their responsibility including by

1522
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:53,870
writing better calls for tender when

1523
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,020
they do because what often happens is

1524
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:59,690
that the the call for tender already

1525
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,520
locks in a government to an enormous

1526
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,990
extent in terms of what can and cannot

1527
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,580
be done with the technological

1528
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,160
procedures in terms of oversight and

1529
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,130
accountability later so if you have the

1530
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,390
terms of reference with loopholes and

1531
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,000
trust me that a lot of these big

1532
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:16,430
companies involved in these

1533
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,800
multi-billion dollar contracts globally

1534
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,480
they have teams of lawyers that can

1535
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,730
really use all the loopholes if there's

1536
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,770
not a very clear call for tenders so I

1537
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:27,920
think there is a lot that can happen to

1538
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:29,720
improve what is clearly lacking now but

1539
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,820
to suggest that anyone can look under

1540
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:35,149
the hood and that's for example take the

1541
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:37,190
American case again imagine foreign

1542
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:39,020
observers for an election observer so

1543
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,430
let's say me let's say I was an election

1544
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,410
observer in the United States and I

1545
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,149
would call on the authorities the

1546
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:47,799
electoral board or whatever the proper

1547
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:50,000
name is in in Iowa and say hi here's my

1548
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:52,580
credentials I would like to look in the

1549
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,870
servers please I mean everybody would

1550
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,420
just say are you kidding that's like

1551
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:59,480
national security

1552
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,910
you know off-limits territory nobody can

1553
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,700
look in the servers let alone foreign

1554
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,620
observers so the whole dynamics there it

1555
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:09,980
changes a great deal from when you can

1556
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:15,890
actually sit and see vote by vote you

1557
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:20,210
know type type type coded results going

1558
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:22,700
in etc etcetera in the way this plays

1559
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:25,250
out most strongly in the in the states

1560
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:28,810
at least is that the people who

1561
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:32,600
developed the voting machines and so on

1562
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:35,930
assert intellectual property rights to

1563
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,230
the software and they say you can't see

1564
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:44,299
it there because it's proprietary and

1565
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:48,880
our trade advantage and so on and that

1566
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:52,040
and and that's a condition of the sale

1567
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,380
contracts also sometimes prohibit you

1568
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:59,119
from talking disparagingly about the

1569
01:01:54,380 --> 01:02:03,380
product - and it's a it's a very good

1570
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:05,630
yeah it's a very good point I agree I

1571
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,040
don't have much to say but I think when

1572
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,200
it comes down to is this kind of issue a

1573
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,690
transparency that's credible for you

1574
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,520
kind of alluded to sometimes it's not

1575
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,660
there and if it's not there for

1576
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,560
something as fundamental as a voting

1577
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,549
process or voting software or

1578
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,619
understanding what's actually happening

1579
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,000
then it's a big problem and that's why I

1580
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:25,070
think a lot of countries have said no to

1581
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,869
online voting to turn in amounts of

1582
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:29,599
digitization of the voting process

1583
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:30,950
simply because it's very very it becomes

1584
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,599
much more difficult to do those checks

1585
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:35,118
and balances and all of a sudden you

1586
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,650
can't have anyone observing you have to

1587
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,680
have a specialist that knows

1588
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:42,530
specifically how to inspect this bit of

1589
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,259
code even if it's even allowed based on

1590
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,790
the arrangement and this specific person

1591
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,849
is the only person to tell you if this

1592
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:52,460
system is working as it should or not

1593
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:56,200
one person and what if this one person

1594
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:59,089
is somehow amenable to persuasion yep

1595
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,160
that's that's that's the big problem we

1596
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:03,109
have when it when things are much more

1597
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,930
digitized my technology becomes a much

1598
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:09,470
more fundamental part of election

1599
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:10,220
process thank you no any questions from

1600
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:15,310
the audience

1601
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:15,310
well many let's start from here please

1602
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:19,609
hi I'm Dennis Morris from Lana

1603
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,859
University I have been really enjoying

1604
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:24,650
this panel so thank you for that and I

1605
01:03:21,859 --> 01:03:27,170
think one of the interesting things that

1606
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,790
was said among many was so there's a

1607
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,770
difference between protecting sort of

1608
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:34,099
the technology of the election process

1609
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:36,410
and on the other hand is your point

1610
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:39,650
you're protecting the mind of the voters

1611
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:41,720
and sort of the first one is is at least

1612
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,280
it has some some things we can work with

1613
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,419
so there's there's a long tradition but

1614
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,650
also a hack is forbidden by law

1615
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,240
interfering with the system is forbidden

1616
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,069
by law so there's there's a legal

1617
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,879
component to it where say okay this is

1618
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:55,420
illegal

1619
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,130
protecting the minds of the voters

1620
01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:00,289
doesn't actually involve any crime it

1621
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:02,900
doesn't actually involve something where

1622
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:04,759
you say okay this is clearly wrong yet

1623
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,619
we're extremely worried about it and

1624
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:09,650
rightly so I think and there's also

1625
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:12,680
probably a line that starts for example

1626
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,960
most were very enthusiastic when when

1627
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:18,440
sort of the really internet savvy

1628
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,880
campaign of Obama started and now we're

1629
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,160
really worried about where we ended up

1630
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,960
with cameras analytical but those are on

1631
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,788
a spectrum they're not the same but

1632
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,609
they're on the same spectrum so the

1633
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:31,190
question then to the panel is so if

1634
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:33,440
there's no crime if it's really hard to

1635
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:35,210
sort of grasp what it is then how do we

1636
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,339
deal with the protection of the mind of

1637
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,079
the voters and maybe marici gave it gave

1638
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:43,160
the first sort of in wrote into it us

1639
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:47,180
okay election observer observation also

1640
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:50,328
has more more intangible things like

1641
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,828
voter intimidation those kinds of things

1642
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:53,269
so maybe it's that kind of terminology

1643
01:04:51,829 --> 01:05:09,289
where we need to look for I don't know

1644
01:04:53,269 --> 01:05:12,019
but it's to the panel okay you know I

1645
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:13,609
think it's a very tricky subject area

1646
01:05:12,019 --> 01:05:16,269
because the freedom of expression again

1647
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:19,940
it says is a fundamental element of

1648
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:22,218
rules-based democracy and changing a

1649
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:25,369
person's mind is actually also the goal

1650
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:27,650
of a campaign that's legitimate and that

1651
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:30,890
doesn't use any manipulation or or

1652
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,989
malicious kind of methods so it is very

1653
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:35,900
tricky but I think we need to challenge

1654
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:39,519
ourselves in the question are there no

1655
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,539
illegal activities taking place because

1656
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:44,238
one we have the question of foreign

1657
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:47,119
meddling then we have the question of

1658
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,890
botnets then we have the question of

1659
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,769
micro targeting where I think it can be

1660
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:54,940
argued that the use of certain personal

1661
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:58,328
data for advertisement is challengeable

1662
01:05:54,940 --> 01:06:00,460
at least in some legal systems

1663
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:04,549
advertising laws I believe should be

1664
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:06,369
very vigilant ly applied so what is and

1665
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:09,430
is not allowed

1666
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:11,989
non-discrimination very important I

1667
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,940
think we need algorithmic accountability

1668
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:16,369
I've made that case four years now but

1669
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:18,680
the whole idea that there's one sector

1670
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:20,450
so powerful and so unregulated without

1671
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:23,180
any oversight in the public interest

1672
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:24,890
whether it's for for manipulating the

1673
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:27,109
minds in the Democratic context or in

1674
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:29,930
the anti-vaccination context in whatever

1675
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:33,019
I think it's it's unacceptable and

1676
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:34,729
unsustainable so I think there's a lot

1677
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:36,769
that can be done perhaps and other

1678
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:39,229
elements is that we we need to think

1679
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:41,029
about the function that public

1680
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:43,098
broadcasting had in creating a shared

1681
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:44,809
space in ensuring that certain

1682
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:47,239
information that was deemed of a general

1683
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:48,469
interest could reach certain parts of

1684
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:50,569
the population we don't have the

1685
01:06:48,469 --> 01:06:51,799
equivalent online and especially as

1686
01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:54,079
younger people

1687
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:57,380
gather information as you mentioned

1688
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,119
pretty much exclusively online one the

1689
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,880
sense of a shared space gets entirely

1690
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,519
lost and two a sort of Public

1691
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,809
Broadcasting function gets entirely lost

1692
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:07,339
so I do think that there are ways in

1693
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:09,499
which we can approach the problem

1694
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:11,180
without infringing on the fundamental

1695
01:07:09,499 --> 01:07:12,950
freedoms that set us apart from

1696
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,479
countries where there is a Minister of

1697
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:16,819
truth with all the devastating

1698
01:07:14,479 --> 01:07:18,680
consequences but you're right it's it's

1699
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:20,359
very very tricky yeah yeah I've

1700
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,460
completely agree it's very very tricky

1701
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:27,049
and you know one of the questions that

1702
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:30,289
that we kind of have to answer is is it

1703
01:07:27,049 --> 01:07:31,849
right to change the message that people

1704
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:33,440
want to see and it's gonna matter what

1705
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:35,210
you were saying before about what what

1706
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,829
individuals want you know some of these

1707
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,839
platforms are making significant most of

1708
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:41,569
money and based on giving people what

1709
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:43,069
they want to see based on clicks micro

1710
01:07:41,569 --> 01:07:47,058
micro appetising and these different

1711
01:07:43,069 --> 01:07:49,219
things so wanting against my mind which

1712
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:51,410
I'm actually seeing much more in the

1713
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:55,430
research space these days is this idea

1714
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:57,609
of counter influence campaigns and the

1715
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:59,839
idea there is that if there are people

1716
01:07:57,609 --> 01:08:02,719
preventing messages trying to influence

1717
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:05,558
people one way then potentially as a

1718
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:08,749
country as an organisation as some

1719
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:10,999
someone less interested maybe there is a

1720
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:12,828
role to have come to campaigns actually

1721
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:14,479
trying to highlight the truth about a

1722
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:16,130
particular situation but then this goes

1723
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:18,259
back to the question of who defines the

1724
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,460
truth you know this is a slippery slope

1725
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:20,689
right

1726
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,660
as you were mentioning as well you know

1727
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:24,858
this is a very very slippery slope one

1728
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,139
thing that I do think is very very

1729
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:28,400
important is at least for there to be a

1730
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,620
better and this goes back to your point

1731
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,229
as well about monitoring there needs to

1732
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:35,719
be a better focus on proper monitoring

1733
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:39,019
of the messages being disseminated via

1734
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:40,730
these platforms if at least we can have

1735
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,290
a better understanding of what message

1736
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:43,910
have been disseminated what their aims

1737
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,979
are then we're out it's in a better

1738
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:48,108
space to try to understand maybe what to

1739
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:49,218
do about it but the reality is it's a

1740
01:08:48,109 --> 01:08:51,140
very difficult problem and it's a

1741
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:51,739
problem that countries are struggling

1742
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,509
with right now

1743
01:08:51,738 --> 01:08:55,179
because they're massive misinformation

1744
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:57,770
disinformation campaigns

1745
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,000
they're targeting people's minds because

1746
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,380
they know at this point that might be

1747
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,210
considered the weakest link especially

1748
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,920
when it comes to election voting so the

1749
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,420
question is you know what what do we do

1750
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,380
about it and I honestly don't have an

1751
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:10,310
answer because there's a very very

1752
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:13,310
difficult question I would simply

1753
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:17,450
suggest that all of the measures that

1754
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:20,299
most of the measures that you described

1755
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:24,769
as the things that we can do are things

1756
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:29,000
that intuitively I I think are I promise

1757
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:31,460
and are good things to do but I think at

1758
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,950
least in a u.s. context with is the one

1759
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:37,700
I'm most familiar with every one of them

1760
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:39,469
would be seen as infringing upon free

1761
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:43,309
speech yeah for about for about free

1762
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:45,980
speech right and I I'm willing to bend

1763
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:48,680
First Amendment but I'm not willing to

1764
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:50,870
break it and I don't know how far I can

1765
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,430
I feel comfortable going and that that's

1766
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:54,259
the tension that I feel I'm very

1767
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,730
sympathetic to the things that you said

1768
01:09:54,259 --> 01:10:03,080
I just don't know how to implement it in

1769
01:09:55,730 --> 01:10:05,629
any meaningful way thank you and first

1770
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,890
row then in the third row and then we go

1771
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:11,090
back thank you my name is Lisa Boston

1772
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,040
with the mccain institute of

1773
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:15,739
international leadership and I do

1774
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,380
cybersecurity of elections so I

1775
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:20,269
partially feel like Elizabeth Warren by

1776
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,870
saying I have a slide for all of these

1777
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:25,660
questions at the lunchtime election talk

1778
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:28,660
but then I also have a few questions

1779
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,660
that

1780
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:34,989
the first one is that surely with the

1781
01:10:31,889 --> 01:10:36,659
social media conversation the focus

1782
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:38,949
shouldn't be so much on the content

1783
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:42,070
because you know it's a First Amendment

1784
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:48,629
right though it's your prerogative as a

1785
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:51,639
politician to promote the discourse and

1786
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:53,829
surely the focus currently has to be on

1787
01:10:51,639 --> 01:10:56,110
the public's right to know who's

1788
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:58,268
whispering in their ears where the

1789
01:10:56,110 --> 01:11:00,938
misinformation comes in Raley's the

1790
01:10:58,269 --> 01:11:03,400
synthetic identities the you know

1791
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:06,099
creating conversations that don't

1792
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,829
organically exist in those political

1793
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:12,459
spheres so aren't we getting off track

1794
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:14,739
by focusing on the content and the

1795
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:17,229
solution of an objective truth that we

1796
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:20,159
could potentially establish in political

1797
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:22,929
discourse which has never happened

1798
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:25,659
because propaganda by definition isn't

1799
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:28,419
that and shouldn't we instead focus on

1800
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:31,089
making sure that we understand who's

1801
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:33,130
focusing who's whispering India where's

1802
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:34,929
instead because that's where the

1803
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:36,550
deception is really happening

1804
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:38,949
you mean the origin of the content

1805
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:41,139
exactly and you know the amplifier of

1806
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:43,449
the content which readies where the

1807
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:48,789
social media cases we talk about go to

1808
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:53,739
and then just a follow-up do you chase

1809
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:57,550
in most lays regardless of the use of

1810
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:59,530
technology Easter ever has the river can

1811
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:01,539
there ever be an election system that is

1812
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:04,389
not based on trust

1813
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:06,639
on paper 100% of faith and the ballot

1814
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:08,860
box you still trust that that box is

1815
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:11,409
properly sealed and the counting happens

1816
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,900
and as a voter you will never be able to

1817
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:16,629
verify how your vote travels and paipai

1818
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:19,030
that so isn't requiring that sort of

1819
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:21,130
verifiability the unfair to technology

1820
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:23,709
there's always going to be an element of

1821
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:28,409
trust either in election observers or

1822
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:28,409
the election management yeah Jason

1823
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:36,880
apropos of the focusing on the source

1824
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:39,250
versus the the content

1825
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,910
how can I object to the more

1826
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:47,110
transparency about source but the on the

1827
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:52,900
the the psychological reality is that

1828
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:59,380
people don't care and it it doesn't

1829
01:12:52,900 --> 01:13:01,960
matter I do i approval of the trend

1830
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:03,250
greater care transition but do I think

1831
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:09,010
that it makes any difference

1832
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:11,170
not much so if I can pick up on the

1833
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,490
second question further focusing on more

1834
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:16,720
on technology

1835
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:19,059
I mean if technology is is but I think

1836
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,770
the reality is that the challenge of

1837
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,420
technology s there's trust required to

1838
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:24,550
any building system yes there's trust

1839
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,980
required second of any technology system

1840
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,540
I think the real challenge with with

1841
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,219
trust when it comes to technology and

1842
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:34,990
the use of more digital systems when it

1843
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:37,900
comes to voting is people are I find

1844
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:39,519
people are more likely to trust

1845
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,259
something one that they've had for a

1846
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,410
long period of time even if it doesn't

1847
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:47,230
work and to something that at least they

1848
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:49,570
can relay it to much more so everyone

1849
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:52,059
can relay it to the offline voting

1850
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:53,799
process when it comes to the online

1851
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:58,390
voting process people start to get a

1852
01:13:53,800 --> 01:14:00,130
little fidgety even to be frank so I

1853
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:02,620
love technology absolutely love

1854
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:05,020
technology every time I go to enter my

1855
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:08,590
credit card details into online site to

1856
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:11,140
buy something I kind of struggle it may

1857
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:14,740
see a little bit because I think oh is

1858
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:16,690
this it is the right site and I think

1859
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,710
with technology people are like that and

1860
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:20,710
with it when it comes to me as

1861
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:21,820
fundamental as as voting you know really

1862
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,570
we're talking about democracy here

1863
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:26,469
something that's really really

1864
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:28,809
fundamental to two countries online

1865
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:31,030
voting voting using much more forms of

1866
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:33,310
technology is challenging because people

1867
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:35,170
start to trust it a little bit less

1868
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,940
because it's less transparent and

1869
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:39,130
everyone won't get that level of

1870
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:41,379
understanding in the technology where

1871
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:44,350
they can get it much easier offline and

1872
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:46,150
another reality you can have it we're

1873
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:48,169
kind of with the real emphasis is is

1874
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:52,070
that all of us are accustomed

1875
01:14:48,169 --> 01:14:53,570
to off flame voting is a big difference

1876
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:56,419
to take something that everyone is

1877
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:58,880
accustomed to and even if it doesn't

1878
01:14:56,419 --> 01:15:02,169
work and give them something new that

1879
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:05,149
shiny and maybe promises to be better

1880
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:06,739
everyone is a little bit struggle

1881
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:08,449
everyone struggles a bit to make that

1882
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:10,188
transition and I think we have that bit

1883
01:15:08,449 --> 01:15:14,749
with technology whether any form of

1884
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:16,789
technology that we have so I just just

1885
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:18,110
wanted to add very brief points one is

1886
01:15:16,789 --> 01:15:19,699
there's been a lot of reference to the

1887
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:22,880
First Amendment and you know there

1888
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:25,039
there's a lot to be jealous about but it

1889
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,800
doesn't cover the whole world so I think

1890
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:30,530
we will see regulation that is going to

1891
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,869
reign in the space for the tech

1892
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:35,959
companies that may not be according to

1893
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:38,619
the American model and secondly when it

1894
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:41,119
comes to transparency and everything

1895
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:42,619
there have been attempts now leading up

1896
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:45,049
to the European Parliament elections for

1897
01:15:42,619 --> 01:15:49,329
example to have transparency registers

1898
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:51,469
of political ads and it was very easily

1899
01:15:49,329 --> 01:15:54,110
proven to be completely dysfunctional

1900
01:15:51,469 --> 01:15:55,969
you know days ahead of the elections it

1901
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:57,409
was possible to buy an ad you're not

1902
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,329
supposed to be able to also buy

1903
01:15:57,409 --> 01:16:01,938
political advertisements from other

1904
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:03,679
countries right so it should then be

1905
01:16:01,939 --> 01:16:05,179
notified and you could you were not

1906
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,429
supposed to according to Facebook's

1907
01:16:05,179 --> 01:16:09,949
promises be able to blast into other

1908
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:12,079
countries but it was remarkably easy to

1909
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:14,629
do so anyway so I think the cost of

1910
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:17,090
negligence and the cost of failure to

1911
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:18,199
comply with agreements should go up and

1912
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:21,340
we need to look at the bigger picture

1913
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:23,030
because looking at campaign

1914
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:25,309
advertisement without looking at

1915
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:28,099
campaign financing requirements makes no

1916
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:29,929
sense I mean we still have complete in

1917
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:31,969
transparency in terms of who gets money

1918
01:16:29,929 --> 01:16:34,969
where and in many countries including my

1919
01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:37,039
own no requirement for disclosure so

1920
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:38,419
it's fine to disclose you know a couple

1921
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,999
of things that happen online but if you

1922
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:42,709
have millions coming in sideways and you

1923
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:45,289
know in completely in transparent ways

1924
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:47,449
that can have major impact and nobody

1925
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:48,978
would ever know so we need to look at

1926
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:50,928
the whole ecosystem I've also heard

1927
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,459
people saying you know who who needs to

1928
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:55,189
challenge this information when you have

1929
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:56,570
Fox News that is just going on and on on

1930
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:58,039
the television the whole day and a lot

1931
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,420
of people look at that the whole time I

1932
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:01,860
mean you know that it is

1933
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,900
it is a mistake I believe to think that

1934
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,610
there is a magic solution only tackling

1935
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:07,170
the the social media networks in other

1936
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:08,699
words I mean I'm very keen to tackle

1937
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,900
them don't get me wrong but I certainly

1938
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,650
don't pretend that it's the only

1939
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,870
solution

1940
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:19,170
and this there's still a question of the

1941
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:21,390
third row working yeah

1942
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:23,550
I'm somewhat at Thomas I'm working here

1943
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:27,030
at the CCDC in Tallinn in the legal

1944
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:29,130
branch thank you first of all that you

1945
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:32,370
made us aware that election security has

1946
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:34,560
many layers and casting the ballot

1947
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:37,620
casting your vote is just the last stage

1948
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,500
of a bigger picture and I want to focus

1949
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:43,530
on propaganda so one of the first stages

1950
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,710
on how I implant some ideas in your

1951
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:50,940
brain so my argument and please I want

1952
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:53,250
that say no or yes in the end to my

1953
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:55,169
argument is that it's not about the

1954
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:58,170
content that has to be regulated but

1955
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:00,449
it's how you transmit those contents

1956
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:03,030
that has to have a stronger regulation

1957
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:06,480
and I give you two examples so when you

1958
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:09,630
when you when you vote for somebody

1959
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,419
before radio before television before

1960
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:14,460
social networks and Internet you went

1961
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,460
out you see these posters when all the

1962
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:20,310
people showing their agenda right so how

1963
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:22,469
do you check those sources you go to the

1964
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:25,920
neighbor and you say oh I mean this guy

1965
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:27,780
it looks nice and where you were where

1966
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,510
are you voting for in the next elections

1967
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:32,759
right so even this kind of background

1968
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:34,920
check of information it's not that

1969
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,480
reliable because you're going to speak

1970
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,219
to other people that probably don't have

1971
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:43,650
the solution to that so in in our age

1972
01:18:40,219 --> 01:18:48,060
the fact that we use the technology to

1973
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:51,330
share this kind of news which are

1974
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:54,750
probably long we don't know is that the

1975
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:58,290
problem of scale so if we use imports

1976
01:18:54,750 --> 01:19:00,860
for example to retweet stuff or to or to

1977
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:04,890
share news and a given example from the

1978
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:08,219
Italian side I'm from Italy we had this

1979
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:11,460
politician that has a trial ongoing and

1980
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:14,700
he just posted on Twitter okay this

1981
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,860
accusation that are making me are not

1982
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:19,590
are flawed and I don't give up that

1983
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:23,130
tweet for 24 how one has been retreated

1984
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:27,690
in a number of times with the use of

1985
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:30,180
pots a forensic studied a show that so I

1986
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:33,179
mean the content is not the problem I

1987
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:36,060
mean the problem is how you implant that

1988
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:37,950
idea in your mind and you're right

1989
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:40,650
because everybody is using social

1990
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:43,290
networks and social network flow by by

1991
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:45,809
nature because they know algorithms that

1992
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:48,390
are like checking how many seconds are

1993
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:50,850
you watching a particular news and then

1994
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:53,640
they bomb you with news related to that

1995
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:57,510
so my point is not about the content but

1996
01:19:53,640 --> 01:20:00,090
it's how you limit the services to do

1997
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:02,760
something to for example new sharing and

1998
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:05,670
stuff because tweet Twitter is allowing

1999
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,640
bots is allowing the use of bots so it's

2000
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:10,770
it's it's a yeah that's a that would be

2001
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:14,820
my argument and this if you can comment

2002
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:17,280
on that I will be glad so my opinion

2003
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:20,130
would be that the the challenge that we

2004
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,630
will always face is that when it comes

2005
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,980
to some of these platforms Twitter

2006
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:25,560
Facebook it depends you know whichever

2007
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:29,040
one you choose and their businesses

2008
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:32,340
right twitter is an interesting case

2009
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,680
because Twitter has been struggling when

2010
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,420
it comes to can users for quite a period

2011
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,910
of time right Facebook that's quite well

2012
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:40,770
Instagram and stuff occurs quite well

2013
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:42,660
Twitter kind of loses users quite often

2014
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,910
so Duda has kind of adopted this policy

2015
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,730
where they're happy to allô allô bots

2016
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:49,340
the best of my understanding anyway and

2017
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:52,370
but the reality is with these platforms

2018
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:54,150
they are there to make money right and

2019
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:56,099
making money is all about understanding

2020
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:58,410
who the users are what the users want

2021
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,210
what the users are interested in and

2022
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:01,830
tailoring to that going my wants again

2023
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:03,060
to what do they want

2024
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:04,860
okay let's give them what they want

2025
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:06,870
because then they'll come back let's

2026
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,250
monitor exactly which story they focus

2027
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:11,370
on because we'll target them with more

2028
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,780
of those stories and I think with when

2029
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,340
we come in it comes to kind of elections

2030
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:16,530
a tie in into your problem that you're

2031
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,910
kind of your mention of scale pace

2032
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,920
these are reading some of the big

2033
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:22,950
challenges we encounter be

2034
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,330
messages that are emotive or have been

2035
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,519
proven to be retweeted retweeted and

2036
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:27,510
shared the most because then it goes

2037
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,890
back to what you were saying before you

2038
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:30,240
know if there's someone next door are if

2039
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:32,940
I tell all of you that is a giraffe

2040
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:34,200
outside everyone's in a kind of Molineux

2041
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:35,549
ok let's go take a picture at the raffle

2042
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,080
let's post it online because no one will

2043
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:40,160
believe there's a giraffe walking around

2044
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:43,050
Estonia and the challenge there is that

2045
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:44,519
we all kind of think and the whole

2046
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:46,290
thing's a settler Society says that

2047
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,300
you're popular you're more popular you

2048
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:51,240
get more shares to get more likes based

2049
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:52,410
on some flamboyant stuff and when it

2050
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,540
comes to elections when it comes to

2051
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:56,760
misinformation a lot of the messages are

2052
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,260
targeted like that and they targeted

2053
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,850
like that and sometimes they're

2054
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,830
amplified by bots that have been

2055
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:03,600
recruited just for that purpose or

2056
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:05,220
sometimes they're pushed by trolls that

2057
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,600
have been set up just for those purposes

2058
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:11,880
and I completely agree that the message

2059
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,410
is one thing and the source is another

2060
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,550
thing you know both of these things need

2061
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,410
to be tackled both in me to be

2062
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:18,960
understood but we always must remember

2063
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:20,730
there is there's this pull right these

2064
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,930
platforms need to make money they're

2065
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:25,230
businesses let's be frank

2066
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:27,150
right so for them is this constant

2067
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:28,769
challenge of how much should we do to

2068
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:30,809
make money but still keep society

2069
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:33,390
relatively happy so we can continue to

2070
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,010
make money and that that's where we are

2071
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:39,000
and my response to your question

2072
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:50,880
not sure if t anymore totes was a quick

2073
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:52,230
reminder that question from their very

2074
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,820
center because it's the last word but we

2075
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:57,450
can carry the discussion on to the

2076
01:22:53,820 --> 01:23:00,719
eighth floor thank you very much for

2077
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:05,370
your engaging discussion Barry sander

2078
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:08,640
fgv Brazil very I'll keep it brief

2079
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:10,260
as regards content moderation it seems

2080
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,360
to me that no matter how carefully you

2081
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:16,320
craft a rule for example relating to the

2082
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:19,230
Nancy Pelosi video creating exceptions

2083
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:25,200
for parody or satire because rules are

2084
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:26,360
applied by humans and also by algorithms

2085
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,590
that aren't always going to be accurate

2086
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,570
there's always going to be error right

2087
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,830
there's always going to be error in how

2088
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:34,070
those rules are applied how they're

2089
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:39,930
interpreted

2090
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:43,049
so then the discussion shifts to what

2091
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:46,950
happens when your content gets taken

2092
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:48,570
down erroneously and then I just

2093
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:50,700
wondered if though the panel had any

2094
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:53,240
thoughts on you know Facebook's been

2095
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:57,330
talking about an oversight board how

2096
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:59,940
given the scale of these platforms does

2097
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:02,040
that does does the panel have any sort

2098
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,450
of thoughts on effective appeals

2099
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:12,600
mechanisms and how that might

2100
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:15,059
conceivably work in this space no wish I

2101
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:18,030
did I mean the the scale problem is is

2102
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:20,870
is exactly the the right question to be

2103
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:24,420
asking don't know how to deal with that

2104
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:27,840
you use the word taken down erroneously

2105
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:30,990
who decides what's an error and and how

2106
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,390
do you know that it's an error I mean my

2107
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:35,190
content is my content by definition it

2108
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:37,500
shouldn't be taken down right that

2109
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:44,030
that's my view of it otherwise I'm going

2110
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:47,580
to put it up and so it was me do i maybe

2111
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:49,980
maybe I trust about another body to

2112
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:53,570
adjudicate that if I also see that body

2113
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:57,240
taking down the posts of my opponents

2114
01:24:53,570 --> 01:25:00,809
but denna that gets to a very tricky

2115
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:03,120
calculation well I think the question is

2116
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:05,190
really who's in charge of the procedures

2117
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,480
and the fact that Facebook now they call

2118
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:09,719
it con so I've heard them mentioning

2119
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:12,419
Supreme Court as well I don't think my

2120
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:15,150
eyebrows can rise any higher Supreme

2121
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:18,750
Court by facebook I mean that's that's

2122
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:21,299
like all in the wrong direction right so

2123
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:22,860
you want independent processes but you

2124
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,810
also want to perhaps look at the

2125
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:27,179
amplification because maybe the scale

2126
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:30,000
problem is a self-made problem you know

2127
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:31,620
why is that manipulated video of Nancy

2128
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,470
Pelosi viewed hundreds of millions of

2129
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,750
times is it because it got recommended

2130
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:38,250
is it because it was the first hit when

2131
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:40,260
somebody started looking for Nancy

2132
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:43,260
Pelosi video or Nancy Pelosi at all

2133
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:46,170
speaker Pelosi whatever so I think there

2134
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,280
are certain discretionary decisions that

2135
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:48,809
a platform can make

2136
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,429
as they already do but which I think

2137
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:53,159
they need to be more transparent about

2138
01:25:50,429 --> 01:25:57,150
so you know how does ranking work how

2139
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:58,558
does how do certain messages go go up

2140
01:25:57,150 --> 01:26:00,388
and down and whatnot so this can be

2141
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:02,250
towards regulators this kind of

2142
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:04,710
oversight or there can be more

2143
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:06,449
understandable and accessible terms of

2144
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:08,340
use there can be all kinds of things

2145
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:10,289
that that are in the realm of what a

2146
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:11,940
platform can do but when it really comes

2147
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:14,579
to freedom of expression issues I would

2148
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:17,039
suggest you don't want procedures of

2149
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:19,920
redress all in a company but that you

2150
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:23,909
want more objective verifiable let's say

2151
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:26,610
neutral verification like like what said

2152
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:27,960
because before you know it and this is

2153
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,489
really where I think the incentive for

2154
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:32,070
the platform's themselves comes in

2155
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:33,959
everything becomes politicized as we're

2156
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:35,699
seeing now the far right accusing the

2157
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,369
the social media platforms of being too

2158
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:40,199
left-wing a lot of other parts of

2159
01:26:38,369 --> 01:26:42,239
society thinking that they've greatly

2160
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:43,799
helped the far-right boost their

2161
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:46,049
messages which they would have otherwise

2162
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,639
not been able to spread or advertising

2163
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:51,300
campaigns that they would have otherwise

2164
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:53,309
not be able to wage organizing capacity

2165
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,550
for for new networks I mean you can you

2166
01:26:53,309 --> 01:26:59,460
can look at who benefits and probably

2167
01:26:56,550 --> 01:27:02,460
never agree but when it comes to freedom

2168
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:04,289
of expression and and semi legal

2169
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:06,210
decisions I would say keep it in the

2170
01:27:04,289 --> 01:27:08,190
public realm keep the oversight in the

2171
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:11,429
public realm anchor it to the law as

2172
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:12,239
much as possible to also make sure that

2173
01:27:11,429 --> 01:27:13,710
the rule of law

2174
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:18,150
online gets strengthened and not

2175
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:19,050
outsourced privatized obscured automated

2176
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,480
etc etc

2177
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:25,079
I just really really want one quick

2178
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:27,570
thing to mention and one thing that I've

2179
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:30,869
always fun with technology right and is

2180
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:33,090
that the more we implement rules to you

2181
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:35,969
know deal with issues as soon as we

2182
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:37,500
become we say this is the rule someone

2183
01:27:35,969 --> 01:27:40,170
knows exactly what the rule is and they

2184
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:41,280
try to find ways to circumvent it this

2185
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,929
is a problem that we'd be facing

2186
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,610
security for many many years it's kind

2187
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:47,730
of an arm race in cybersecurity where

2188
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:49,320
the attacker does something the defender

2189
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:51,480
catches up the attacker does something

2190
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,949
defender catches up I unfortunately feel

2191
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,959
it's going to be a lot of the case with

2192
01:27:52,949 --> 01:27:56,610
with with any approaches but in the

2193
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,500
place whether it by Facebook or or so on

2194
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,610
as soon as the technology is known as

2195
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,830
soon as the approaches

2196
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:03,960
- okay we take them stuff looking like

2197
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:05,219
this someone is gonna adapt it in some

2198
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,139
way and pour something and they're gonna

2199
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:08,520
try lay out and the reality is with

2200
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:10,320
these networks with Z platforms actually

2201
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,820
with society in general a lot of kind of

2202
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,830
the way things are done this is the

2203
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:15,900
reality it's an arm wrist constantly

2204
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:17,670
pick pick pick whatever you want to look

2205
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,230
at is constantly an arm race there will

2206
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:21,270
be attackers there will be defenders and

2207
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:25,110
that's the reality elections election

2208
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:30,360
security is no different I think that

2209
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:31,710
this is a very on point it was a very on

2210
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,449
point and we should take them to the

2211
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:36,000
lunch break especially to the lunch

2212
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:38,699
session now upstairs on the eighth floor

2213
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,489
and in case it wouldn't be for day

2214
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:43,710
upstairs lunch session I would make a

2215
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:45,900
wrap up now but because we continue the

2216
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:47,880
discussion anyway then I will have to

2217
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,739
cut it up a bit abruptly now but thank

2218
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:53,540
you all for listening and thank you for

2219
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:53,540
the man yes I got a prize for the funny
