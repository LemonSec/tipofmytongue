1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,000
yeah good afternoon and thank you for

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,760
the great introduction

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,610
I actually didn't expect that to you

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,160
know introduce me so long but I I

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,000
started this position this year so it's

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,490
a real where the new function in Estonia

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,820
to have to do this

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,839
SOI policy development at the

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,980
ministerial level but today this

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,280
afternoon in this session we talk about

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,559
silent battle strategies and under this

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,760
smart title we have actually three

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,290
topics first how countries have

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,699
developed their offensive cyber

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,680
capabilities over the years second

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,079
whether or not it is reasonable to

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,809
expose an attacker during a cyber

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,710
conflict that's the second topic and the

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:02,280
third one is what are the military cyber

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:05,570
operations other than war and for these

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,409
topics we have three great panelists

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:14,280
first dr. max Smith who is a research

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:18,350
fellow in cyber security at the Stanford

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,920
University and he is also a non-resident

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,369
cyber security policy fellow at

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,810
University of Oxford then we have miss

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:35,400
Gillan Boram from Israel who is the head

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,950
of research at U vanaman I hope I got

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,619
the name right workshop for a science

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,189
technology and security and she is also

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,259
a research fellow at Tel Aviv University

32
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:51,600
and the third panelist is mr. Brad

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,920
Bigelow who is the principal technical

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,798
adviser to the deputy chief of staff

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,740
cyberspace at shape and for you who

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,320
don't know who what shape is it is a

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,579
supreme headquarters Allied powers

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,859
Europe so now it's clear and Brad has

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,200
been intimately involved in the

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,810
development of the concept and structure

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,019
for the

42
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,810
proposed cyberspace Operations Center at

43
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,440
shape and now we already know what shape

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,489
means before we start with the

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,680
presentations

46
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:32,410
let me ask first that how many of you is

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,840
actually working in the military /

48
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,349
defense sector could you just raise your

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,250
hand okay thank you very much

50
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:45,549
so I see that approximately half of the

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:49,239
auditorium already knows the topics but

52
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,160
the rest maybe are not so familiar with

53
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,730
this topic so we just have to keep it in

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,470
mind

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,819
while presenting the topics and also

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,910
having this discussion about the

57
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,579
structure of the session first we are

58
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,950
going to have three presentations is

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,250
each presentation takes about 10-15

60
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,810
minutes or a little bit more and after

61
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,930
each presentation we have little bit

62
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,500
time for immediate questions and after

63
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,290
all presentations we have about 40 I

64
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,459
hope we have at least 40 35 minutes for

65
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,890
discussion and more questions and now we

66
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:31,359
can start actually with the

67
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:34,119
presentations the first is done by Max

68
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,880
and he will talk about the development

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,709
of offensive cyber capabilities among

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,870
NATO countries and actually before you

71
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:48,010
start your presentation let me ask you

72
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:52,299
that why do countries actually need

73
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,569
cyber offensive capability and let's

74
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,549
exclude the war time situation that of

75
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,220
course when there is a war then we know

76
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,190
that there is a military forces should

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,709
have offensive capability but is there

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,730
other reasons as well that if there is

79
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:13,180
no war its normal peacetime do countries

80
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:20,709
actually need offensive cyber capability

81
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:22,030
would you like me to answer it now so

82
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,650
let's be very clear here on what we mean

83
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,020
with capabilities right does the

84
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,900
military need C and D C and E CNA

85
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,990
doesn't

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,760
defense capabilities of spirit

87
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,530
capabilities as well maybe for the

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,230
military for a variety of reasons and

89
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,729
then attack capabilities and I think in

90
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,200
all these three cases you can make a

91
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,150
strong argument that there are some

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,229
opportunities for that I will raise a

93
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,820
few during the presentation but one of

94
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,480
the key ways that we that we have to

95
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,790
think about it is of course that much of

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,790
the activity that takes place below the

97
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,380
treasures of armed attack and fall that

98
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,480
we might have to cause friction as I

99
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,070
will discuss in this presentation to

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,240
potentially disrupt that force aerial

101
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,460
activity as well and for that

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,400
potentially military cyber operations

103
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,169
are at a good tool I'll touch upon it a

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,510
little bit more detail this this

105
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,960
question call me off-guard I have to say

106
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,060
yeah but action so we can have better

107
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,810
interaction and questions from the

108
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,450
auditorium

109
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,300
feel free so let's spray to keep it as

110
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,340
interactive as possible Thanks rule so

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,370
actually for this session I'm gonna talk

112
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,229
less about NATO members organizational

113
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,310
path towards conducting offensive cyber

114
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,630
operations and more about NATO members

115
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,730
cooperative path or potential

116
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,850
cooperative path towards conducting

117
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,530
offensive cyber operations and as the

118
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,040
starting point of analysis I'm gonna

119
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,609
take the u.s. strategy of persistent

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,530
engagement and defend forward here is

121
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,900
the argument and that I'm gonna lay out

122
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,580
for you first u.s. cyber strategy of

123
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,070
persistent engagement and defend forward

124
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,590
implemented last year officially is a

125
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,120
fundamental strain change in strategy it

126
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,419
seeks to operate seamlessly globally and

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,660
continuously that also includes

128
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:15,830
potentially operating in allied networks

129
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,590
of course the US and allies and other

130
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,719
actors have always operated in allied

131
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,299
networks we have to be honest about that

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,510
in two ways one as an observer

133
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,010
potentially collecting Intel and two as

134
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,690
a passerby going through those networks

135
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:34,520
to potentially get into adversarial

136
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,800
systems and networks but now it has

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,870
changed because it seeks to be achieving

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,290
effect being a disruptor as well to

139
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,020
cause friction

140
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,900
adversaries I'm gonna argue this this

141
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,299
type of activity will potentially lead

142
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,960
to what I call allied friction loss of

143
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,260
confidence and trust adversaries can

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:02,150
exploit this friction they don't act

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,860
randomly in the future as other

146
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,890
countries will adopt their strategy the

147
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,380
u.s. can equally become a battleground

148
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,870
for allies and so I'm going to come up

149
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,870
with a concrete proposal and that is a

150
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,440
NATO Memorandum of Understanding on CNA

151
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,180
so rather hopefully and provocative

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,340
argument or hopefully at least I think

153
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,830
it is and but also concrete way to

154
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,250
potentially move forward let's take each

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,770
step in turn here

156
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,450
so first about the u.s. strategy for

157
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,240
those of you who may not know we saw two

158
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,599
key documents being published in 2018

159
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,360
the u.s. DoD cyber strategy and before

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,760
that the Cyber Command vision the Cyber

161
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,460
Command vision talking about persistent

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,440
engagement and the DoD strategy

163
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,210
primarily focusing on the fend forward

164
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,520
although these concepts have them be

165
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,890
delinked the fundamental notion

166
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,690
underlying strategy I think is an

167
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,260
important one and an accurate one too

168
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,770
but actually the most focus in the past

169
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,409
has been on this high Android activity

170
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,210
potentially attacks that can destroy it

171
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,340
a great critical infrastructure and so

172
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,140
on and yet what we see today the

173
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,270
majority of activity takes place below

174
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,039
the trash of the bombed attack or ever

175
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,330
the activity that does take place below

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,150
the trash of the bombed attack those

177
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,490
operations linked into broader campaigns

178
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,609
can still be strategically meaningful

179
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,150
the cumulative effect of dose can still

180
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,760
have significant implications for great

181
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,010
power competition or beyond for the

182
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,349
international system that's the change

183
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,630
the fundamental change and also thinking

184
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,419
about what we see in this space and

185
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,360
potentially what needs to be dealt with

186
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,340
right and so if this is a space of

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,120
constant contact where actors can

188
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,290
constantly engage and seek to create

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,840
advantages over time and not just

190
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,730
through one single catastrophic event

191
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,560
the argument then of US Cyber Command

192
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,200
and DOD is to hey we need to

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,020
persistently engage with the enemy with

194
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,260
the adversary and so one of the key

195
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,439
principles that is then comes up and

196
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,880
according here from the vision

197
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,800
highlighted in bolt also in strategy is

198
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,700
that US Cyber Command needs to operate

199
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,529
seamlessly globally and continuously

200
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,080
their dearest to be where the adversary

201
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:23,720
is to minimize their freedom of maneuver

202
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,670
and not just the Terr but also to cause

203
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,190
inherent friction in the operations that

204
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,229
are going on at a specific moment in

205
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,690
time and we see this also across a

206
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,300
number of other publications around this

207
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,910
general polemic a Sony has a very

208
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,770
interesting article in and Joint Forces

209
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,680
quarterly and several other publications

210
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:45,380
of key people which have helped riding

211
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,680
this strategy as well to court in order

212
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,300
to point to another quote so in the

213
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,459
strategy we'll see this statement

214
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,750
superiority through persistence seizes

215
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,510
and maintains the initiative in

216
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,700
cyberspace by continuously engaging and

217
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,689
contesting adversaries and causing them

218
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,820
uncertainty wherever they maneuver the

219
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,040
goal is to operate as close as possible

220
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,290
to the adversaries and their operations

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,870
as close as possible is important right

222
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,469
it's not just at the source but as close

223
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,640
as possible what is implies is that the

224
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,940
US Cyber Command seeks to achieve

225
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,600
effects that are one outside of its own

226
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,160
networks but also beyond or outside of

227
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,860
the networks of its adversaries

228
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,900
now that vast space that is not

229
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,120
uncovering space of course we're not

230
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,490
talking here about I don't know some

231
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,980
vacuum we're talking here about specific

232
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,600
things such as routers in Nairobi or

233
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:44,180
servers in Denmark and so on right and

234
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,760
some of that is of course based on our

235
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,300
territory cyberspace always touches

236
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,480
ground somewhere as I mentioned to us

237
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,459
and also our actors have always operated

238
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,500
in this space for a wide range of good

239
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,270
reasons potentially it could be argued

240
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,720
right they think about being an

241
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:05,199
observant active intelligence collector

242
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,730
and even doing fourth party intelligence

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,950
collecting intelligence and allied

244
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,810
networks together to acquire more

245
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,380
information about what adversaries are

246
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,390
doing in those networks and so on

247
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,860
nothing new here there is also nothing

248
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,020
new when we think about this kind of

249
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,910
notion of passerby actually going

250
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,490
potentially through what would be

251
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:29,689
described as notes a line notes to

252
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:32,060
access an adversarial networks where the

253
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,610
difference comes in is following the

254
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,380
strategy and its language isn't being an

255
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,030
active disrupter I'm not doing this

256
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,230
piratical e or regionally but doing this

257
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,939
globally continuously and seamlessly I

258
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,700
could only come up with one case or find

259
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,070
one case before in which I saw this type

260
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,130
of behavior and if you know any other

261
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,990
cases I would love to hear so Alan

262
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,010
Nakashima wrote this report for the

263
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,710
Washington Post in May 2017 about an

264
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:04,420
operation that was conducted in late

265
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:07,100
2016 in which the u.s. wide servers of

266
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,560
Isis propaganda that were based in

267
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,360
Germany there was some notification

268
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,739
process in one way or another there's

269
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,940
not described in any detail in in the

270
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,450
report and also in the following

271
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,400
follow-up piece in cyber scoop but what

272
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:28,820
was clear is that the Germans were of

273
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:31,730
course frustrated by this so the point

274
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,340
here is that what I don't want to say is

275
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,950
that operating potentially in this space

276
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,170
and doing this instantly or seamlessly

277
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,270
doesn't make sense from an operational

278
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,620
perspective you could actually come up

279
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,930
and eat with a number of really good

280
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,060
arguments for doing so and s was stated

281
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,489
actually not in the 2018 Cyber Command

282
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,339
symposium but but the one two weeks ago

283
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,210
in 2019 indeed opportunities within this

284
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,250
domain are fleeting

285
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,110
we might not have months to take

286
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,410
something down and go through a long

287
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,240
diplomatic process and so on you might

288
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,310
have to act quickly potentially in

289
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,960
allied networks to cause friction to

290
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,790
reduce freedom of maneuver of our

291
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,050
adversaries and do so constantly

292
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,730
globally and seamlessly and in fact you

293
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,219
might also say in some cases allies

294
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,510
actually don't mind us Cybercom coming

295
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
in and operate in their networks

296
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,540
particularly when there is a high level

297
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,530
of trust when there is a feeling that

298
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,750
this will also

299
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:27,350
the general defense of that system which

300
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,210
seeks to defend but of course the key

301
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,460
question here and one I want to propose

302
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,000
today is but what if an allied country

303
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,950
is not keen on having the US military in

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,350
its networks actively seamlessly and

305
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,230
continuously disrupting an adversary's

306
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,140
cyber operations that's the key question

307
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,210
and so what we've seen today written and

308
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,860
I've written about some of these issues

309
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,880
as well when we think about the

310
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,590
implementation of the strategy

311
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,450
particularly the u.s. ready because it

312
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,330
was such a fundamental change in

313
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,130
strategy last year we primarily think

314
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,680
about what kind of influences this has

315
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,510
on great power dynamics how it

316
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,790
influences maybe China Russian

317
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,430
operations or as was laid out in the DoD

318
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,410
strategy North Korea and Iran we can

319
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,520
talk about escalatory dynamics there and

320
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,500
how that can lead to more or less

321
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,290
escalation and we can also talk about

322
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,960
setting out norms on how to make sure

323
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,089
that potential future conflict between

324
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,650
those countries does not occur and we

325
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,350
can all have different views on whether

326
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:27,530
that would work out or not but really

327
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,940
for this room for look people were

328
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,069
actually thinking about NATO the key

329
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,050
question here is not so much how the

330
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,420
strategy actually influences these

331
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,699
dynamics of course that's key but it is

332
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,969
actually how does it affect Alliance

333
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:46,550
dynamics that we are potentially faced

334
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:48,589
with now and in the future and so if if

335
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,319
we take this Durbin case and if we truly

336
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,910
take the strategy and the writings

337
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,310
around that and discussions that have

338
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,750
been going on we will expect to see more

339
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,150
of these cases as I mentioned in the

340
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,030
future and that most of that means that

341
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,949
if we want to assess the strategy we're

342
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,720
not just looking again at some of these

343
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,730
key indicators on run deterrence and

344
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,589
causing friction but we have to think

345
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,960
more carefully about how in the minds

346
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,460
Alliance trust and confidence and those

347
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,680
things are much more difficult to

348
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,410
measure these are much more subtle and

349
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,900
much less easily observable of course

350
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,550
potentially diplomatic backlash or

351
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:27,290
friction and so on what is an

352
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,329
interesting dimension which is not

353
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,579
always realized is actually when we try

354
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,880
to defend forward and to potentially

355
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,260
allied networks or anywhere else as

356
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,670
these be in those systems where the

357
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,370
adversary is and where the adversary

358
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:44,780
operates through but the adversary

359
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,910
obviously doesn't operate randomly right

360
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,800
if I will be Russia and I could go

361
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,199
either through a country through a note

362
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,240
from which I know it would cause a light

363
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,680
friction or I could go through a

364
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,740
different country which one would I pick

365
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,109
well if I wanna make cars more friction

366
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,300
and an already potentially existing the

367
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,240
vision I would exactly go through those

368
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,500
notes that cause diplomatic friction so

369
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,480
it's not just that we're trying to

370
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,160
defend forward against random acts and

371
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,910
see wherever they are and that's where

372
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,469
we're going to go after them no actually

373
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,540
the strategy if you would really

374
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,170
carefully might provide adversaries an

375
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,050
opportunity to actually further create

376
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,910
divisions in an ongoing alliance the

377
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,219
other question that is worth considering

378
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,170
one about the nature of a strategy and

379
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,740
how to move forward is is this question

380
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,510
well what would happen if NATO allies

381
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,690
would adopt their own strategy of

382
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,790
persistent engagement and defend forward

383
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,860
so not integrate their strategy within

384
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,329
u.s. strategy of defend forward and

385
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,110
persistent engagement right that's not

386
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,760
what I'm talking about

387
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,280
but to have their own strategy so that

388
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,840
they also want to operate globally

389
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,939
continuously and seamlessly reduce

390
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,220
freedom of maneuver of adversaries cause

391
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,160
friction wherever they go before they

392
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,630
are in allied networks what would it

393
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,550
until well that would probably until

394
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:05,420
that many allies would have to operate

395
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,280
and us systems and networks to actually

396
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,660
potentially defend forward because

397
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,699
that's where you can expect some of the

398
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,829
adversaries to be an operator now from

399
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,270
my feeling is I don't think that that

400
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,250
would be something that the US would

401
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,369
necessarily agree with or be happy with

402
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,069
[Music]

403
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:27,260
and that brings us to a broader kind of

404
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,420
understanding of I think where we have

405
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,910
to go from here if this is what we've

406
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,370
faced with today I think there are a

407
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,230
number of set of questions that we have

408
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,050
to be honest about and have to address

409
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:44,510
exactly in this forum here today and

410
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:47,830
this this conference one one point and I

411
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,830
also mention it in the paper

412
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:52,519
which provides a more broad framework

413
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,049
around organizational capacity is of

414
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,659
course we have seen the declared launch

415
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,158
of a wide range of branch services and

416
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,110
units to conduct military cyber

417
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,809
operations and we can debate then what

418
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,508
military cyber operations are and above

419
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:07,158
all and this goes to the question to

420
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,480
address where are many of these

421
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,889
countries which establish an

422
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,629
organization actually know what they

423
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,668
want to use it for and what do they have

424
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:15,918
a capacity behind it so I'm not sure

425
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:18,230
whether if countries would want to have

426
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,879
a strategy of persistent engagement they

427
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,739
will be able to they might declare that

428
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:24,168
they have an organization or command or

429
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:25,700
whatever form of unit of branch doesn't

430
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,679
necessarily mean of course that they

431
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,499
have a capacity but the question still

432
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,970
stands because it shows and it gives us

433
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,499
a better understanding of the nature of

434
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,470
the strategy and how we potentially have

435
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:39,619
to work together so here's a concrete

436
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,999
proposal the compete concrete proposal I

437
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,918
would like to lay out is that we need a

438
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:45,289
Memorandum of Understanding between NATO

439
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,149
member states concerning cooperation on

440
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,940
offensive cyber affects operations or

441
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:51,979
many of you will consider status CNA on

442
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,950
networks and systems on their territory

443
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,619
I would love to have feedback on the

444
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,139
exact nature of this proposal on what it

445
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,999
would include but I think some of the

446
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,969
killing key building blocks have put

447
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:07,759
here on on this slide so one it needs to

448
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,859
be foreign alliance as a whole because

449
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,019
doing it with just individual countries

450
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:14,059
will exactly create this opportunity for

451
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,619
friction and see where we have an

452
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,289
understanding on where we don't so needs

453
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,090
to be an alliance wide framework in my

454
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,169
view second it needs to have two

455
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,049
building blocks one it needs a

456
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:25,820
notification framework so in which cases

457
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,710
wooded country actually wouldn't make

458
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,369
sense for a country to actually go in to

459
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,799
an allied network to achieve certain

460
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:36,619
effects if when and how now I think some

461
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,539
will say never but we need to come up

462
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,939
with a notification process not least to

463
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,320
create some predictability and stability

464
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,440
somewhat of almost a confidence-building

465
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,139
measure within NATO I would say right

466
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,539
when can we expect the u.s. to actually

467
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:53,059
go into LR Network to do something like

468
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:55,129
that I think it's absolutely crucial to

469
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,799
have more transparency on that and the

470
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:59,899
second one is not just like we need to

471
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,668
think about a notification process so if

472
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,969
you're gonna notified allies this how

473
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,769
are you

474
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,769
to go about that not every form of

475
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:10,429
notification is equally good of course I

476
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:11,960
don't believe that this necessarily have

477
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,710
to be shared every information around

478
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,950
CNA bilaterally I think that can be

479
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,879
sorry-sorry through the how Alliance as

480
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,070
a whole I think it can be shared

481
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:25,730
bilaterally but of course as reasons for

482
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,580
like OPSEC reasons and so on and the

483
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,370
sharing unlike some mo use on C and D

484
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,860
computer network defense or CNE do not

485
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,840
necessarily have to be reciprocal and

486
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,029
that's for the simple reason that some

487
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,259
will do it more than others so it

488
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,799
doesn't really make sense to have

489
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:44,059
reciprocal sharing here thank you for

490
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:53,629
your time and I look forward to your

491
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:55,340
questions yes thank you very much max is

492
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,980
there any questions related to this

493
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,600
topic yes there is one let's take two

494
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,440
questions before the next presentation

495
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,439
just wait a minute for the mic

496
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:15,100
okay thank you just a question on

497
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,860
notification framework are you thinking

498
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,350
post facto notification because if

499
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,979
you're thinking pre facto you know of

500
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,080
course what jumps to mind is

501
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,230
opportunities are fleeting in time and

502
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,189
space and slot for cyber maneuvers

503
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,610
firstly and secondly what kind of a

504
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:38,860
paradox does it create where an ally

505
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,840
provides pre-notification and the other

506
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,809
ally says no thank you stay out of my

507
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,939
networks if you're looking for friction

508
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,039
then I would think that would be a

509
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,289
recipe for friction as well where the

510
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,570
requesting allies own networks are in

511
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,220
danger absolutely I think that's a great

512
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,559
comment so you need to start first with

513
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,870
a notification framework before you talk

514
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,250
about the notification process right we

515
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,879
first need to put a framework in place

516
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,220
about when and where and how you would

517
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,200
actually go in to achieve effects you

518
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,610
need to agree on that and then second

519
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
part is to think about the process of

520
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:16,059
doing that and of course it needs to be

521
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,380
done before and yes so like as I put

522
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,809
also on this quote I generally agree

523
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,750
that that many of the opportunities are

524
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:26,289
fleeting here in this domain right but

525
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:29,200
oftentimes they aren't either and I'm

526
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,690
not talking here about month-long

527
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,419
processes but you know something like

528
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,039
Isis propaganda surely like it's

529
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:39,100
important viola take it down to date and

530
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,559
tomorrow but really by not taking it

531
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,779
down today I don't know what the serious

532
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,120
consequences are for tomorrow they might

533
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,860
be there but you know in certain cases

534
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,209
they are in certain cases they aren't

535
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,889
and I think that's exactly one of the

536
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,350
things that should be considered by

537
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,480
establishing some form of notification

538
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,158
but it doesn't really exist today there

539
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,570
is very much in certainty about one that

540
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,730
would occur and when that wouldn't occur

541
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,279
and I think it's in the interest of all

542
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:06,880
members of the Alliance to have much

543
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,679
more clarity on that great is there any

544
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,169
comments by other panelists to this

545
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,669
topic not at the moment so let's take

546
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,669
another question from the auditorium

547
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,178
okay if there is not they have actually

548
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,679
another question - oh great

549
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,900
yes

550
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,820
so you talked about notification to

551
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,620
other nation states but the interested

552
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,050
party here would also include the

553
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,300
private sector whose network is being

554
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:36,100
accessed what role does the private

555
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,230
sector have in being having their

556
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,969
network used I think that's that's

557
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,530
terrific question you know right it's

558
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,040
actually much worse question that they

559
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,040
asked you first

560
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,330
absolutely no I think that's a that's a

561
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,770
very fair question because of course

562
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,330
most of the networks through which an

563
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,420
adversary would operate are not meal

564
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:58,000
networks and so it will have to require

565
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,860
some kind of layered approach where you

566
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,620
will have to notify the private sector

567
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,179
as well around these issues the others

568
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,979
answer right now is how you would go

569
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,870
about that and what kind of layered

570
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,860
approach you want to have in terms of

571
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:14,169
notification and how it changes dynamics

572
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,149
depending on the official status of that

573
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,860
company where it is officially located

574
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,680
its headquarters and so on I wouldn't

575
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,270
know so I think it's a very fair point

576
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,190
and I've thought about it before but I

577
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,600
can't give you a perfect answer on how

578
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,220
you would establish the process right

579
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,100
now to deal with that in terms of

580
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,950
communication okay thank you very much

581
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,610
let's leave other questions - after all

582
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,460
presentations so the next presenter will

583
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,500
be Gill and she will talk about the

584
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,380
whether or not it is reasonable to

585
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,270
expose an attacker during a cyber

586
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:53,110
conflict and they have actually a

587
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:55,210
surprising question today as well so if

588
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,939
it if you as a person you know working

589
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,880
in the cyber domain everybody knows that

590
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,050
you're the cyber person probably and if

591
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,870
suddenly you notice that somebody has

592
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,850
hacked your computer and you know the

593
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,929
attacker probably has gotten some

594
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:16,840
information and finally he or she has

595
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,730
closed access to your computer are you

596
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,189
willing to you know expose this

597
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,320
situation are you willing to talk about

598
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:30,070
that to other people that you as a cyber

599
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:31,070
person attacked I think I would try to

600
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,520
answer

601
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,730
by the things I'm going to talk in the

602
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,850
presentation you know it's actually it's

603
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,780
very simple answer yes or no okay so yes

604
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:49,310
and I think as a we'll show next I will

605
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:52,940
have many I would gain many benefits

606
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,280
from it from Shane as though I'm a cyber

607
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,950
person and I've been attacked and that's

608
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,330
what happened and now let's see what I

609
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:09,650
can do with it and and I think I should

610
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:12,290
do it right and if I won't expose it and

611
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:14,180
maybe someone else will say we'll reveal

612
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,070
it to something like that I'll be

613
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,200
embarrassed you know actually I know

614
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,820
that the answer is not so simple yes or

615
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,280
no so you can actually have no

616
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,830
possibility to present the theory behind

617
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:33,170
the question so please okay thank you

618
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:36,340
very much okay so thank you right we'd

619
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:39,050
like to thank the organizer first for

620
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,929
having me here this is my first time at

621
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,629
cyclone and I'm very excited to be here

622
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,970
and present my research what I'm going

623
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:52,750
to present in the next fourteen minutes

624
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:57,590
maybe less is a part of broader research

625
00:26:52,750 --> 00:27:00,820
which is my based on my PhD research in

626
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:04,220
the larger project I'm dealing with the

627
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,139
victim attacker dynamic during cyber

628
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,320
conflict and in this paper in this

629
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,310
presentation I will present you some

630
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,020
insights regarding only the victim side

631
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:18,320
and in the the paper in the book is a

632
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:25,330
co-authored with the dr. ossama a from

633
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:27,740
Tel Aviv University so see okay so

634
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,889
mainly when we think I want to usually

635
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,590
think about cyber attacks we think about

636
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,960
certain aspects like the anonymity and

637
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:39,699
secrecy that is cut these attacks

638
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,710
allowed for both attacker and victor and

639
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,260
about

640
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:49,150
problem of attribution that was

641
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:53,710
discussed earlier and that can lead us

642
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:56,590
to expect that mainly victims of cyber

643
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,130
attacks won't be so hurry to expose the

644
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:04,779
attack and blame their attacker as as

645
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:07,270
you asked me that the countries might be

646
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:09,400
embarrassed to reveal the vulnerability

647
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,408
they might suspect that if they will

648
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,380
reveal the fact they've been attacked

649
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:17,740
they will have they will be attacked

650
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,409
again and we can expect that many

651
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:24,429
countries will choose to keep it silent

652
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:27,340
and not go public about the attack but

653
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:29,919
reality as we know from recent years

654
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,750
gives us a big shows us a bit a

655
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:37,570
different picture in which in many cases

656
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:40,000
countries that were attacked chose to

657
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:44,408
reveal the fact they've been attacked

658
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,470
and expose the attacker and that leads

659
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:51,070
us to the main research question of this

660
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,860
study which is mainly why why and under

661
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,350
which geopolitical circumstances they

662
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,559
choose to go public and reveal the

663
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,120
attack the fact they've been attacked in

664
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,250
order to understand that let's first

665
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,799
take a look at the victims

666
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:09,130
decision-making process okay so this is

667
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,760
a cyber attack right in first let's see

668
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,750
if it works

669
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,289
no yeah great first the first question

670
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:21,549
is if the attack did the attack was

671
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:23,740
detected or not if the victim has strong

672
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:28,149
cyber capabilities cyber defense

673
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:31,210
capabilities he should detect the attack

674
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:34,330
okay so this is the first question once

675
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:37,450
the attack has been detected the second

676
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,418
question is which strategy should it

677
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,059
choose if it decides to remain covert

678
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:45,159
it's a different story which I'm not

679
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:48,690
going to talk about it now but I'm

680
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,330
talking it about it a bit in the paper

681
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:54,320
but if the victim chooses to go public

682
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:58,279
then again in

683
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:04,668
has to option to attribute the attack to

684
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:07,429
a specific attacker or not and now let's

685
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:10,429
take a moment to look about the bigger

686
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:16,370
picture the bigger analytic framework we

687
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:18,919
offer so first we the we see that there

688
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,658
are two strategies which are public

689
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,470
which I'm going to discuss is going to

690
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:26,509
discuss and two which are not okay so

691
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,240
we're talking only about the public

692
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:33,429
strategies and the motivations reasons

693
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:37,279
for the victim to choose each strategy

694
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:42,049
so first the first one is to publicize

695
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:45,080
the attack and accusing the attacker and

696
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:49,970
attributing the attack so the first

697
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,189
reason might that we that we examine is

698
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,320
we call it the naming and shaming which

699
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,919
is not actually a reason it's a tactic

700
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,590
with many benefits for the victim okay

701
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,700
by naming and shaming the attacker the

702
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:08,000
victim as we we saw in many cases and

703
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:13,330
especially in the leading the led by the

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,899
US the government the victim can gain

705
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:20,509
international support for the for action

706
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:22,729
by naming and shaming the attacker the

707
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:26,450
victim can say I know who did it

708
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,850
I've been attacked I need to act if I

709
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,990
can gain international support of

710
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:38,209
imposing sanction and retaliate maybe

711
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:40,340
and the other reasons we identify I the

712
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,679
first one is saving face and the second

713
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,639
one is setting the narrative and we saw

714
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:49,539
that I will discuss soon in the DNC hack

715
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:54,490
but we saw that when when the victim

716
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:58,039
decides to go public he bought he

717
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,019
suffers he might suffer might be

718
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,720
humiliated by revealing its

719
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:04,549
vulnerabilities but at the same time he

720
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,309
said this is what happened I've been

721
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:11,240
attacked and I know how to deal

722
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:15,080
it okay I'm I'm I'm ready and I know how

723
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,840
to deal with it and how to to fix my

724
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,389
vulnerabilities okay and that helps the

725
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,019
victim even to set the narrative and

726
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:27,860
maybe be or become again like the u.s.

727
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:29,870
case like in the den seconds becoming

728
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,309
like a world leader in dealing with

729
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:36,100
cyber attacks

730
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:36,100
okay publicly and the last reason is

731
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,748
sending a magic message singling by

732
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:44,269
revealing the attack and accusing the

733
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:47,090
attacker the victim sends a message I

734
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:49,700
know you did it and I'm going to respond

735
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:54,918
in a way in a time that I will choose

736
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:58,100
okay and the others from the second

737
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,669
strategy is publicizing the attack

738
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:06,110
without attributing it to a certain

739
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:08,690
attacker and in this case we ask why if

740
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,149
we saw in the first strategy we saw that

741
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,519
there are benefits for accusing the

742
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:16,758
attacker publicly in certain cases

743
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,950
countries choose to reveal the fact

744
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,619
they've been attacked without accusing

745
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:26,690
the attacker and we ask why why they do

746
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:29,418
it so in this case we saw that country

747
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:32,389
this is mainly because of national

748
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:36,679
security means okay because they need

749
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:38,869
the fear of escalation if the alleged

750
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,450
attacker if in relation with the alleged

751
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:46,158
attacker are they have tension between

752
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,049
them and the other reason might be the

753
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,649
safety of sources of intelligence

754
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:55,070
sources that might might get harm if the

755
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:58,279
victim will expose its attacker so these

756
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:01,129
two cases I will discuss in just a few

757
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,289
more slides but this is our analytical

758
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:06,498
framework that we established and then

759
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:10,550
we wanted in the research to go and see

760
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:15,230
what is happening in real cases okay so

761
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:18,440
we regarded data based on two really

762
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,810
important data sets and we added new

763
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,070
data regarding sick

764
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,900
see okay like who revealed the attack

765
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:30,110
did the attack was revealed who revealed

766
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,770
the attack was it the media was it a

767
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:37,250
government and this kind of variables

768
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:39,920
and we examine only the past three years

769
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:43,730
but in the bigger project we will have

770
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:47,900
data about more than twenty years back

771
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,889
and what we found and that was really

772
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:54,080
interesting we found that in more than

773
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:58,549
50% of the cases which is which are the

774
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,850
blue and the red ones of the pie we saw

775
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,650
that countries do choose to go public

776
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:07,190
okay it means that in over 50 percent of

777
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:11,470
the cases countries do see many

778
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:15,910
advantages in revealing the attack sorry

779
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:18,169
in 29 of 21 percent of the cases

780
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:21,080
countries choose to reveal the attack

781
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:25,460
without attributed attribute in it and

782
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:28,759
in 37 cases they choose to reveal an

783
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:33,680
attribute it to a specific attacker in

784
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,960
the other cases 35 percent chose to say

785
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,140
nothing and no comment and an

786
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,820
interesting thing that we deal with in

787
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:46,339
the paper is there are cases where

788
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,980
countries judge we call it to claimant

789
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:52,750
functions these were cases where

790
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,430
countries suffered an attack and

791
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,920
something that expert thought you

792
00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:01,220
thought was attack cyber attack and the

793
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,590
victim said no it wasn't the the normal

794
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:10,250
function the the thing that happened is

795
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:13,970
not as a result of cyber attack okay and

796
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,370
not just the last few slide the two case

797
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,589
studies that were studying deeply in the

798
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:25,220
paper the first one is the DNC hug from

799
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:30,830
2016 and we see in this case as I

800
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:32,330
mentioned earlier the u.s. said publicly

801
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:37,460
that it has been

802
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:41,420
tact and we saw we saw did naming and

803
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:44,270
shaming strategy and getting many

804
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,620
benefits from doing so okay we can see

805
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,930
that from 2016 the u.s. started to lead

806
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,319
in other countries follow by growing

807
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:57,290
public and blaming especially Russia

808
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Russia but also China in cyberattacks

809
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:09,470
and the u.s. many countries are studying

810
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:13,520
from the US case and the other case we

811
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:17,270
we study in the paper is the thing

812
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,980
health hack in 2018 and in that was an

813
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:24,230
interesting case because most of the

814
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,650
experts estimated that it was China

815
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,920
during responsible for the ETA but in

816
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:35,810
every public statement and which

817
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:41,060
Singapore took really good care of the

818
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:43,549
attack and and in establish a committee

819
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,259
of inquiry and was very open about

820
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,270
everything that happened and informed

821
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,720
its citizens but in every public

822
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:53,210
statement and this one is from the chief

823
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,850
executive of the cybersecurity agency of

824
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,970
Singapore they said we cannot reveal the

825
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:02,810
identity of the attacker okay and here

826
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:05,359
we see that Singapore has its own

827
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:08,230
reasons okay like especially the fear of

828
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:13,190
escalating the relationship with China

829
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:16,100
which led her to relate it to be really

830
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:20,120
open about everything besides the

831
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:22,670
identity of the attacker and now just

832
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,830
some conclusion by the correct

833
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:27,530
conclusion I call it stage one because

834
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:31,340
it's just the beginning okay it's not

835
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:35,570
final conclusions as this is just a part

836
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:41,120
of a much larger project we see this

837
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:44,540
project makes us see that that the going

838
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:47,779
public has many benefits

839
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,910
and it's maybe changing the way we think

840
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:55,550
about cyber conflict about cyber

841
00:38:49,910 --> 00:39:00,680
strategy it's not as covert space as it

842
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:02,720
used to be and we we see or we call it

843
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,540
the politician of the attribution

844
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,240
problem we're not the first one wants to

845
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:11,300
talk about it but in this case of

846
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,240
growing public we see that the attribute

847
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,090
in the attack to specific data is highly

848
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,049
political act much more or in certain

849
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:23,660
cases much more than a technical act and

850
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,610
just a few last word about the larger

851
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:29,950
project which we hope will be very

852
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:33,170
practical will have very practical

853
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:36,649
results okay in the larger project will

854
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:40,720
will have eventually more than 500 cases

855
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:43,970
we will include non-state actors as well

856
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,459
another kind of cyber attacks and we

857
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:51,259
hope by analyzing such a big amount of

858
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:54,710
data we will be able to create like an

859
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:56,060
analytic tool that will help and will

860
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,280
gain better understanding of the

861
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,420
decision-making process of countries

862
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,980
okay during cyber conflicts and

863
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:08,240
hopefully will help reducing the

864
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:13,840
uncertainty and help making the the

865
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:18,109
entire process more more clear and more

866
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:23,860
with more responsive responsible process

867
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:28,040
and that's it yeah thank you

868
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:30,630
[Applause]

869
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:35,670
okay thank you very much skill is there

870
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:45,990
any questions let's take two clicker yes

871
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:48,570
there is one in the left side thank you

872
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,459
very much for the brief I'm surprised

873
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,850
that you haven't considered as one of

874
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:58,170
your factors for decision-making the

875
00:40:53,850 --> 00:41:03,720
risk of wrongful attribution wrongful

876
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:06,030
attribution yeah we try to take it into

877
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:11,459
account like false flag or something

878
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:14,070
yeah it's it's in it was one of the of

879
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,570
the comments we received on the paper

880
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:20,100
from the our reviewers in this paper

881
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,170
we're not were not taking it into

882
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,740
consideration since it's not a big

883
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:28,560
amount of cases okay but in the in the

884
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:32,609
larger project we do and we we use we

885
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,009
use only open source information so

886
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:37,050
based on what we have and of course we

887
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,510
cannot see the bigger picture or the

888
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:42,840
entire picture because some of it is

889
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:45,750
obviously classified but we will and we

890
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:50,030
are trying to identify these cases of

891
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:56,040
false flag and force attributions okay

892
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:57,000
there stick from here okay thank you

893
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,490
yeah

894
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,880
she had no from the Norwegian cyber

895
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:05,100
defense forces it's also an interesting

896
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,090
aspect with respect to liability and

897
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:11,970
insurance that there sometime could be a

898
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,820
footnote on insurance saying that if

899
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:19,560
it's a state actor attribution there

900
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:23,400
will be limited coverage so just a

901
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:27,870
consideration for these assessments

902
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,190
thank you thank you I think it's just

903
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:34,710
it's a good point

904
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:37,500
and I can say that let's hope it won't

905
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,990
be a considerations a consideration of

906
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,970
countries right with you

907
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,259
that will be a consideration then we are

908
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:48,060
all in a big problem okay because the

909
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:54,660
answers were nice and short let's take

910
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:57,180
one question more very interesting

911
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:01,348
discussion I am interested did you

912
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,339
consider the choice of attribution only

913
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:04,580
within intelligence sharing

914
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,440
relationships or Alliance processes as

915
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,930
one of your factors and then secondly

916
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,609
did you evaluate the role of private

917
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:15,480
sector cyber intelligence capabilities

918
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:18,420
in creating or reducing the need to for

919
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,890
a state to publicly attribute given the

920
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,980
private sector you having done so

921
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,940
effectively on behalf of that entity

922
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,589
don't start from your last question

923
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,630
because I'm not trying to destroy the

924
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:36,150
first one we take into consideration the

925
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:38,609
factor of who who who was the first to

926
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,560
reveal the attack or to expose the the

927
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:44,250
fact that the attack took place and in

928
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,029
that play in in this case we have the

929
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,050
place of private companies is

930
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,839
intelligence companies is really

931
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:55,230
important but then the second thing we

932
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,089
do is to see how the states respond to

933
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:00,359
that and the first question I'm not sure

934
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:02,339
I completely understood the which states

935
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,630
choose to attribute in private

936
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,740
discussions only months to wants

937
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,630
partners or other intelligence

938
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,618
relationships versus a public

939
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:13,770
attribution okay so the there's a big

940
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:17,130
discussion which we touch in in the

941
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:21,390
paper about private attribution and

942
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:25,800
private responses but for the purpose of

943
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:30,240
our our research we as I said before we

944
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:36,170
can measure can examine only the things

945
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,169
that went to the public right that if

946
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,310
Congress chose to to share the

947
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,619
information between the but it's private

948
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,470
I will not know about it so I can I

949
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:50,640
won't be able to examine it in an

950
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:52,060
empiric way yeah thank you okay thank

951
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,980
you very much

952
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:58,869
and now the third speaker is Brad and he

953
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:02,440
has a presentation about military cyber

954
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:04,119
operations other than war and as you can

955
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,280
imagine I have surprising question for

956
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,869
you as well I'm not surprised that you

957
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,869
have a course okay now of course there

958
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:13,359
is surprises already gone but you're

959
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:16,090
going to talk about what military forces

960
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,520
could do or how military cyber

961
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,730
capability could be used during the

962
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:26,320
situation where wise war is not declared

963
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:28,510
so basically peacetime no conflict and I

964
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,390
remember that when I left military

965
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:33,640
forces ten years ago we had a very hot

966
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:36,160
topic about that it was a really

967
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,740
pressing issue that what is the role of

968
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,960
the military how it could support the

969
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:43,118
civilian sector how military forces

970
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,190
could be used in cyber domain and cetera

971
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,220
et cetera that this question is a little

972
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,349
bit provocative that you know ten years

973
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,859
has passed we are still talking about

974
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:57,580
the same questions why is that is there

975
00:45:53,859 --> 00:46:00,400
not enough development or is is it so

976
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,589
hard question to answer to or is it

977
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,650
there are other reasons I don't think

978
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:08,290
it's a hard question to answer if one

979
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,980
has full access to information and let's

980
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:14,910
just use an analogy we are we early on

981
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,580
began thinking about using aircraft as

982
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:20,618
instruments of combat I mean the US Army

983
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,790
was one of the was basically the first

984
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:26,859
customer for the right Wright brothers

985
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:30,250
that was very visible that was very

986
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:32,020
evident it was pretty apparent it was a

987
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,869
big public event I mean the first time

988
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,420
an airplane came to any town it was a

989
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:40,720
big event everybody came out there is no

990
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:43,150
equivalent for for offensive

991
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,069
capabilities I mean you're not gonna

992
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:48,130
know when it came to your town

993
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:50,920
it's not gonna be advertised and it's

994
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:54,520
not gonna be over and so we suffer from

995
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,010
two extremes we I think we suffer a lot

996
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,609
from the extreme of equating it to

997
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:03,310
nuclear weapons oh my god you know and

998
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:05,500
you know we could we could have the

999
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:07,930
electronic pearl harbor

1000
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:12,040
so we have to be super super careful of

1001
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:14,740
this versus frankly the opinion of a lot

1002
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:17,920
of those who are experienced leaders in

1003
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:20,830
conventional areas who say that's it

1004
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,990
what can you do I mean this is what I

1005
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,869
can do with an aircraft this is what I

1006
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:29,310
can do with a tank what can you do oh

1007
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:31,960
well I can take a server out okay

1008
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:34,390
why should I care about that so I think

1009
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,609
the more we kind of have some clarity

1010
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:40,839
and hopefully can segue into this talk

1011
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:43,240
but I'd like to actually take a moment

1012
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,780
to answer the question do you ask masks

1013
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,520
upfront because it kind of comes to what

1014
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,000
I want to talk about here today which is

1015
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:57,460
us do do nations need military offensive

1016
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,380
cyber space capabilities and I guess my

1017
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:03,520
response there it reminds me a little

1018
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:06,880
bit of there's a miny Python skit where

1019
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,340
a private comes in to his lieutenant and

1020
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,619
he says please sir I'd like to leave the

1021
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:18,400
army and he says well why and he says

1022
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:21,400
there's people with guns out there okay

1023
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,970
there's not really a point to organize

1024
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,580
and equip and train military forces if

1025
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:30,359
you're not willing to take them to the

1026
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:34,029
extreme application of that capability

1027
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:36,009
so if you're gonna develop an offensive

1028
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:40,690
capability that's the consequence of it

1029
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:43,030
now does every NATO nation does every

1030
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,330
nation need offensive cyber space

1031
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:47,619
capabilities is a different question and

1032
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,589
I would respond to that play

1033
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:53,109
illustrating a point Admiral it Nielsen

1034
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:55,720
who spoke this morning was mentioned he

1035
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:59,380
was a mine warfare expert as specialist

1036
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,930
in his early days I'm pretty sure

1037
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,710
Hungary does not have any mine warfare

1038
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:08,710
capability okay but they benefit from

1039
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:11,650
being in a military alliance where there

1040
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,470
are allies who can use mine warfare

1041
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,869
capabilities to protect sea lines of

1042
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,069
communication that's one of the great

1043
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:21,380
things about the Alliance is

1044
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:24,080
the cooperation in capability

1045
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:27,350
development to say how can we best

1046
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,020
utilize each other's capabilities to get

1047
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:31,819
the benefit there are capabilities the

1048
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,770
United States and really a few other

1049
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,360
nations are going to develop because

1050
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:38,930
they are about strategic power

1051
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:42,310
projection Jay Healy used her earlier

1052
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:45,710
the example of flying b-52s past China

1053
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:47,600
okay to do that the United States had to

1054
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,390
have in effect the global strategic

1055
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,580
bombing capability and to talk about

1056
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,440
what Admiral Rogers was mentioned this

1057
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:58,220
morning what does that involve

1058
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,690
that meant to fly by China we the US had

1059
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,750
to have the technical means which means

1060
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,660
the aircraft believe me if you've been

1061
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:09,080
involved with aircraft programs there

1062
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:11,240
long term when did when did the u.s.

1063
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,980
start working on the b-52s it was

1064
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,830
probably you can find the paperwork

1065
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:19,070
going back to the 40s okay and we're

1066
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:21,410
still flying them c-130s what a

1067
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,690
beautiful aircraft still flying still

1068
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:26,299
providing value still being adapted

1069
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,480
virtually nothing on a c-130 that's

1070
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:32,330
flying today is original equipment but

1071
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,220
it's an airframe it's a program etc so

1072
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,049
the technical measures is part of it you

1073
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,879
have to cap have capacity which means

1074
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,940
the Train force the force that knows how

1075
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,130
to take off as a organized group of

1076
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,050
aircraft and and to navigate where they

1077
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,180
need to do and deal with refueling if

1078
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,940
that's an issue and and and all of that

1079
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,830
and and also protection they didn't go

1080
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,640
there without some sort of combat ask

1081
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:57,410
fighter escort operational processes the

1082
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,990
processes of organizing and planning

1083
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,640
that now they didn't drop bombs on

1084
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,560
anything which means they didn't do

1085
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,839
weapon earring and target earring but

1086
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,670
they did every other element of mission

1087
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,730
planning including for example what

1088
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:13,160
happens if an aircraft goes down and

1089
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,780
finally the legal and policy frameworks

1090
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,940
that was mentioned by Admiral Rogers

1091
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,820
which is you had a way in which you

1092
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,290
could use that capability and and apply

1093
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,600
it within the rule of law and that

1094
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,290
really kind of gets to the heart of what

1095
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,759
my talk about is about today so if I can

1096
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,440
but actually no because I didn't

1097
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,960
surprise you with the first question no

1098
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,530
another to know that you mentioned

1099
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,380
right now that as the same way as with

1100
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:42,200
other capabilities maybe not the real I

1101
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,450
should have cyber capability but some

1102
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,089
other nations could support industry

1103
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,279
right do you think this analogy applies

1104
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:51,710
you're in the cyber dimensionally so

1105
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,109
absolutely we as Estonian for example it

1106
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,089
cannot have any cyber capability and we

1107
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:59,119
like more you could have some awesome

1108
00:51:56,089 --> 00:52:01,759
ones yeah because the barrier to entry

1109
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,770
here is much different okay than it is

1110
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,650
in other domains your barrier to entry

1111
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,270
to have strategic airlift is

1112
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,740
considerable it's probably you know one

1113
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:12,349
aircraft would be over your entire

1114
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,299
defense budget I'm sure that's not an

1115
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:16,400
option I actually think this this

1116
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,160
statement is arguable but let's have

1117
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,980
somebody from there from the auditorium

1118
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:25,190
will will you know argue about ok please

1119
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,050
enter to the Thank You patient I have to

1120
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,359
start with this disclaimer now this is

1121
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:32,000
on all the papers that that any NATO

1122
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,650
employee provides but I think it's

1123
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,900
important we do it today to understand

1124
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,119
that in this talk I'm really going

1125
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,849
beyond the envelope of what NATO as an

1126
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,760
alliance is agreed getting 29 nations to

1127
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,320
agree to something is a time-consuming

1128
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,359
process

1129
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,250
yes it's time-consuming I also think

1130
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,890
it's invaluable because when we've

1131
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,960
established consensus we have really a

1132
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,299
strong foundation on which to move

1133
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,349
forward and it's an important factor but

1134
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,869
what I'm going to talk about today

1135
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:01,550
really is my own reflections looking at

1136
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:04,670
where we are with military operations

1137
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,200
and this really kind of comes from one

1138
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,180
of the first things when I was second

1139
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,140
lieutenant in the Air Force in the early

1140
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:14,029
80s to kind of do officer in advancement

1141
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,799
we all learned a little trick which was

1142
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,330
we signed up for the Marine I think was

1143
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,820
called the Marine Corps company grade

1144
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,640
officers course which you could take by

1145
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,720
correspondence it was like the first

1146
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,118
officer training after getting

1147
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,000
commissioned you could take and you and

1148
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,650
and it was relatively easy to pass you

1149
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,720
just read the books and went in and took

1150
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:34,520
the test and I think it was the second

1151
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,950
or third volume that came in the mail

1152
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:40,849
it said military operations other than

1153
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:43,250
war and you know that term although it's

1154
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:46,390
somewhat fallen out of style so I

1155
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:49,869
referenced JP joint publication

1156
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,788
3-7 which was the u.s. publication on

1157
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:55,029
fundamental military operations other

1158
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:56,980
than war doctrine that's been superseded

1159
00:53:55,029 --> 00:54:00,039
that's not a term that's used I think

1160
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:02,200
it's a good point to kind of use this as

1161
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:04,539
a thought piece that launched into what

1162
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,759
I think is the fundamental question

1163
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:08,190
we're continuing to ask which is what is

1164
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,710
the appropriate use of military

1165
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:14,470
capabilities in this area of cyberspace

1166
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:17,440
so let's talk about again the ultimate

1167
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:19,299
use of military capabilities is for that

1168
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,150
one thing at top it's war its

1169
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:26,559
large-scale combat operations and in my

1170
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:29,079
mind if what we do in terms of

1171
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,089
conducting military operations means we

1172
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,099
need to be able to operate in land we

1173
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:35,140
need to be able to operate at sea we

1174
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:37,990
need to be able to operate in air if

1175
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:41,170
cyberspace is an area that can affect

1176
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:43,660
our operational capability it absolutely

1177
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:47,140
needs to be within the framework it's to

1178
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:49,509
me it's unthinkable that we would say we

1179
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,490
we have to have the military that can

1180
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,680
operate at that extreme end of the

1181
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,118
spectrum of large-scale armed conflict

1182
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,129
and by the way we're not going to deal

1183
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,440
with any of the cyberspace stuff we're

1184
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:02,109
just not gonna go there it just doesn't

1185
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,420
make any sense part of it is because you

1186
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:07,000
can add value there's no doubt no matter

1187
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,980
what the effect might be it's very

1188
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,529
likely that it can have at least a

1189
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:15,940
supporting effect in the context of an

1190
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:18,730
overall operation but I would argue if

1191
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:21,730
we were in a large Co conflict of NATO I

1192
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:23,230
think you would find a lot of a lot of

1193
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,809
things coming together including

1194
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,880
acceptance of doing things in cyberspace

1195
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:32,230
that we might not be willing to talk

1196
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:35,500
about in a non war environment which

1197
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,930
leads us to this question of what's

1198
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,819
happening below that line well the

1199
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:43,808
things have happened below that line

1200
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:46,900
according to jp-7 was basically two

1201
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:49,539
categories which was the bottom line is

1202
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,910
about support a humanitarian assistant

1203
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:53,769
and support to civil authorities which

1204
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:56,589
is essentially the military playing and

1205
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:58,328
a hundred percent a supporting role to

1206
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:59,700
some other activities so that's

1207
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:02,710
airlifting

1208
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:05,379
non-combatants out of a earthquake

1209
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,690
relief or something like that natural

1210
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,970
disaster relief you know even

1211
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:13,990
domestically and then the other category

1212
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:17,890
is called deter war and prevent conflict

1213
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:19,598
and doesn't that I mean that we just had

1214
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:22,480
a session we're talking about is cyber

1215
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,890
deterrence a valid is it not valid I

1216
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,440
want to say this talk is not about

1217
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:28,450
whether that theory is valid it's not

1218
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,800
about policy questions because those are

1219
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,259
questions that should be addressed by

1220
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,930
policy makers but for the military

1221
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,480
decision-makers we need to say what is

1222
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:39,910
happening below this line and what are

1223
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,650
the appropriate roles for the military

1224
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,540
and and frankly what are the

1225
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,319
inappropriate roles for it for the

1226
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:49,420
military and I'll use the example again

1227
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:51,730
from the Air Force some of you may be

1228
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,680
aware that there was a time in the early

1229
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,710
existence of the Army Air Corps in the

1230
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:01,210
in the US where it was enlisted to

1231
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:05,400
provide postal service high speed postal

1232
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:07,960
service carrying the mail inside the US

1233
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,119
now if you're familiar with that story

1234
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,579
you know that it was a disaster

1235
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:14,470
for one thing for and and it was a

1236
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:17,770
disaster because it was stretching the

1237
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:20,578
capacity of our aircraft capability you

1238
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:23,530
know it was to do that day in day out

1239
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,829
you know it means dealing with flying

1240
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:29,559
and bad weather in in areas where we

1241
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:31,990
hadn't worked out the whole navigation

1242
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:35,730
and error airspace control arrangements

1243
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:39,189
so if pilots were taking a very risky

1244
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:41,980
endeavor and ultimately was abandoned as

1245
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,900
is really a bad idea there's an example

1246
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,180
of a military capability used in an

1247
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,740
appropriate way and and and we're we

1248
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,049
need to make sure that we don't have the

1249
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:53,529
resources to spend military capability

1250
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:55,540
on inappropriate tasks so let's talk

1251
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,750
just this is the u.s. definition NATO

1252
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,609
has a taxonomy for cyberspace operations

1253
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:02,950
relatively similar operations of defense

1254
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:06,598
networks offensive cyberspace defensive

1255
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:09,520
cyberspace I think we can recognize that

1256
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:12,250
all of those things can play a

1257
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,849
supporting role to forces that are

1258
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,749
essential

1259
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:17,920
the leading capability in an operation

1260
00:58:15,749 --> 00:58:19,779
so it absolutely makes sense we're

1261
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,359
always going to need defense network

1262
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:24,160
operations to provide the command and

1263
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,440
control capability to any of Defense

1264
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,558
Forces however they're being employed

1265
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,960
and likewise we could we would want to

1266
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:33,609
defend those capabilities so the network

1267
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,190
operations piece and the defense of

1268
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:38,910
those networks is a key piece offensive

1269
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,349
we can certainly come up with viable say

1270
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:43,269
non-controversial not denial sorts of

1271
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:48,329
things that might might also play a

1272
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:51,038
supporting role but are there operations

1273
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:53,529
where the cyberspace would take the lead

1274
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,089
because I think this is really the area

1275
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:58,690
we're starting to explore in the

1276
00:58:55,089 --> 00:59:01,328
discussions already just today because

1277
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:03,999
we recognize that the threats were

1278
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:07,119
facing in cyberspace a lot of this is

1279
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:10,089
below the level of large-scale armed

1280
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:13,829
conflict so far we haven't seen a

1281
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:16,538
cyberspace electronic world for a harbor

1282
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:18,460
so what we're seeing is things that are

1283
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:22,869
far lower than that in terms of

1284
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:24,819
magnitude of damage and risk scale very

1285
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:27,059
often these are affecting systems that

1286
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:30,819
are outside the military span of control

1287
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:32,729
and these are not things that lend

1288
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:36,099
themselves to conventional military

1289
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:39,759
responses okay an attack on Sony

1290
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:41,890
Pictures does not generate the basis to

1291
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:44,739
say well let's have a flyby or let's

1292
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:47,049
bring a naval flotilla to or do a

1293
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:48,789
blockade or something like that you know

1294
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:52,839
they're they're not proportional

1295
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:54,759
responses now if we look at what's doing

1296
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,160
in this so the first two the for the

1297
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:59,410
operations not a controversial things in

1298
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,359
the u.s. they defined a cyber space the

1299
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,160
defensive cyberspace operations in three

1300
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,019
categories internal defensive measures

1301
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,269
response actions and defense and

1302
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:09,209
non-defense cyber space and I want to

1303
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:11,319
just poke at those for a moment

1304
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,910
fundamentally internal defensive

1305
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:15,160
measures are part of running the network

1306
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,499
now you can organize it in a different

1307
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,629
way the way the US has where you have

1308
01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:21,729
essentially specialist defense teams a

1309
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:24,069
number of militaries are going down this

1310
01:00:21,729 --> 01:00:25,629
line where you essentially have experts

1311
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:26,560
who can come in and help the network

1312
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,170
operators

1313
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,759
Rapid Reaction teams I'm a little

1314
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,410
personally concerned about that because

1315
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,200
if you look at it from a capability

1316
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:38,940
maturity model approach it's really

1317
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:41,140
level 0 which is response by hero's

1318
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,240
ultimately you want to get to the point

1319
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:46,629
where the network operators operate the

1320
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,029
network securely by default they know

1321
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:51,310
how to protect themselves

1322
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:53,050
the next is response actions and if you

1323
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,390
look at the US literature under this

1324
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:57,970
response actions I would argue are

1325
01:00:55,390 --> 01:01:00,779
basically offensive cyber space

1326
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:04,359
operations because they're talking about

1327
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:07,330
carrying out effects in a

1328
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:10,140
non-cooperative system in other words

1329
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:12,970
somebody who didn't agree to be a target

1330
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:15,490
somebody else's system at that point I

1331
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:18,250
think the difference between offensive

1332
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:20,740
and response actions is from a legal

1333
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,660
standpoint from a technical capability

1334
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,220
standpoint from a force employment

1335
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:27,250
standpoint I don't see what the

1336
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:28,810
difference is because they fundamentally

1337
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,310
that comes back to this idea and it's

1338
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,810
kind of a key point that I try to make

1339
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,450
it a paper it's about understanding

1340
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:39,430
whether or not it involves the threat or

1341
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:42,520
use of force because if we talk about

1342
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:44,080
offensive capabilities and particularly

1343
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,720
if we start to have a discussion about

1344
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,910
who the alternatives to are to the

1345
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,250
military forces in conducting offensive

1346
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:53,710
capabilities in cyberspace I think you

1347
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:57,100
quickly see the options are not very

1348
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,720
attractive intelligence agencies well

1349
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,940
actually that's where you immediately

1350
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,879
get into this Intel gain/loss dilemma

1351
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:05,950
where in fact they're very often prefer

1352
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,980
to keep the keep the system up and

1353
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:11,379
running as an exploitation source not to

1354
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:15,100
deny it and lose that access and lose

1355
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:17,410
that's that opportunity industry do we

1356
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,170
really want to encourage that this is

1357
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,609
literally equivalent to cyber

1358
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,950
mercenaries is that the way we want to

1359
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:26,920
go or do we want to essentially leave it

1360
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:29,560
to a white house Pat army of essentially

1361
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,200
volunteers and people who operate on the

1362
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:34,750
basis of goodwill which is an effect

1363
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,759
like a militia in a way neither one of

1364
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,920
those options is attractive in a

1365
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,150
conventional area and I would say it's

1366
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,059
it's neither is it

1367
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:44,920
active in the cyberspace because when

1368
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,839
you look at our military forces

1369
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,299
what are they expert in at least those

1370
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:52,180
of us who are involved with the forces

1371
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:54,369
of Western democracies the members of

1372
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:57,930
the NATO alliance we are committed that

1373
01:02:54,369 --> 01:03:00,970
when we do employ military forces as

1374
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:04,419
providing the use or threat of force we

1375
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:07,078
do that within the rule of law and it

1376
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:11,500
turns out just like that example of of

1377
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:15,099
having a group of b-52s fly by China the

1378
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,460
ability to organize train equip and have

1379
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:20,799
that as a practice about plantable

1380
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:23,380
executable capability cannot happen if

1381
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,710
you wait for the conflict to develop it

1382
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,819
you had these are long-term things even

1383
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,260
though you can say well there are

1384
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:30,910
effects you can create there you know

1385
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:33,549
anybody can saw it right software in a

1386
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:36,520
moment matter of a few hours well good

1387
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:37,809
luck go try that I mean this the point

1388
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,640
it is it doesn't matter what the

1389
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:41,950
technical mean is you have to have the

1390
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:44,020
whole picture you have to have the

1391
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:46,000
ability to organize it you have to have

1392
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,339
trained operators you have to have an

1393
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,990
operational decision-making process you

1394
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:52,150
need to be able to target it you need to

1395
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:53,950
be able to perform data battle damage

1396
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:55,990
assessment you need to be able to have

1397
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:58,000
possibly positive control on its

1398
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,649
capability to be able to turn it off and

1399
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,660
you may need to have the ability to

1400
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,760
confirm that it's a proportional use of

1401
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,890
the capability these are all factors

1402
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,170
that military forces practice and are

1403
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:10,029
used to dealing with in applying the

1404
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:12,130
rules of engagement and the rules of law

1405
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:13,779
and how we use our forces and so it

1406
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:16,750
absolutely makes sense that we use this

1407
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:18,220
in cyberspace as well so if we can do at

1408
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,869
LAN LAN sea air

1409
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:22,270
I would argue it's absolutely clear we

1410
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:24,220
need to do it in cyberspace and you can

1411
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,288
see from the discussions just we've that

1412
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:28,899
we've had today and other elements as

1413
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:31,029
you can see the u.s. idea of defending

1414
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,559
forward is starting to recognize there

1415
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:34,650
are some benefits in using this

1416
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,089
capability but to use it as a military

1417
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:39,210
capability which means it is an

1418
01:04:37,089 --> 01:04:41,890
instrument of national strategy

1419
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,569
absolutely which means the policymakers

1420
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:46,480
are making the decision about whether or

1421
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:48,549
not it's an appropriate response to an

1422
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,319
event like compromise of election

1423
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:53,020
systems that's what that's what they're

1424
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,930
there for but the military's job is to

1425
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,300
be able to

1426
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:59,359
do that in a reliable effective

1427
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:02,150
repeatable predictable fashion that can

1428
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,920
keep us operating so when it is used as

1429
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,900
an instrument of state it's not

1430
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,400
essentially rogue it's not running out

1431
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:12,770
in the open it's not uncontrolled that

1432
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,280
leaves the last category which is also a

1433
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:18,410
very popular topic in discussions of the

1434
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,510
use of cyber capabilities which is the

1435
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:27,950
defense of non defense cyberspace and

1436
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:31,339
this is where I think unhelpful

1437
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:33,680
analogies so the cyber force on force is

1438
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:36,980
one of the most example you frequent

1439
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:39,290
examples of an unhelpful exam analogy

1440
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,510
for for cyberspace operations

1441
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:43,640
we're rarely going to use offensive

1442
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:45,650
capabilities as a one-for-one against

1443
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:52,098
another offensive capability I would

1444
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:54,109
argue but let's use an example the

1445
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:57,230
challenge given to a commander is the

1446
01:05:54,109 --> 01:06:01,910
defender powerplant from attack now if I

1447
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:04,490
need to defend that from the land I can

1448
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:07,490
do that by positioning land forces to

1449
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:09,500
protect it as a physical asset I can

1450
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:11,629
protect it from the sea by having

1451
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,609
maritime forces there protecting the sea

1452
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,920
lines and communications and the and the

1453
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:17,598
maritime approaches I kind of protect it

1454
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,059
from the air by having ground-based air

1455
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:23,900
defense and having air coverage over

1456
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:25,819
that target but if I want to protect the

1457
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:29,299
information systems involved in that

1458
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:33,440
power plan does it really make sense to

1459
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:35,839
put that in the hands of of as a soldier

1460
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,630
somebody from the military I would argue

1461
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:42,589
not simply we need to look at the

1462
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:46,010
numbers how many military cyberspace

1463
01:06:42,589 --> 01:06:47,808
operators even in the defensive side how

1464
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:50,480
many of them routinely deal with

1465
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:52,040
industrial control systems and you and I

1466
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,790
both know the answer to that is either

1467
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:58,609
none or virtually none in the meantime

1468
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:00,650
there are thousands of people who do

1469
01:06:58,609 --> 01:07:02,210
that in industry and you can say well if

1470
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:05,150
they got attacked they're obviously not

1471
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:06,750
doing a very good job you've you mistake

1472
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,700
the fact that

1473
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:11,250
if you are operating a critical national

1474
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,799
infrastructure it's not in your interest

1475
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:17,099
to have unpredictable things happen

1476
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:20,190
disrupting your systems okay so believe

1477
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,990
me I've done studies back in the 90s of

1478
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:24,300
electric power industry and financial

1479
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:27,390
services industries infrastructures and

1480
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:29,130
information systems in the US and what

1481
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,990
you find is those folks really

1482
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:32,910
understand the nominal ease and how to

1483
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,830
detect them quickly and how to respond

1484
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:37,560
to them and how to keep service running

1485
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:40,080
because that's the essence of what they

1486
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,849
provide if they can't provide that they

1487
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,799
can't continue to operate that now that

1488
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:45,359
doesn't mean there isn't a prospect of a

1489
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,150
massive attack or something like that

1490
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,190
but it still comes back to is this the

1491
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:52,619
appropriate use of military capabilities

1492
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:54,359
and I would argue not and so that's why

1493
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:56,750
you know in a way I kind of actually

1494
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:59,490
didn't answer my question in the paper

1495
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:02,820
which was what is military operations

1496
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:04,709
other than war for cyberspace forces but

1497
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,849
I think it really actually you need to

1498
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,310
put in in terms of what are the

1499
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:11,700
appropriate roles for military offensive

1500
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:12,810
and defensive capabilities below the

1501
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:16,639
level of large-scale

1502
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:16,640
armed conflict thank you

1503
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:26,599
yeah I take the opportunity to ask you

1504
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:29,419
the first question okay actually you

1505
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,520
know before I came back to the

1506
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:34,220
government service I was consulting

1507
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:37,580
governments around the world in cyber

1508
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,980
security matters and every time when

1509
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,680
they country wanted to create a cyber

1510
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:44,899
security capability the political

1511
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,090
strategic leadership usually didn't

1512
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:48,950
include military to these discussions

1513
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:51,680
right because they simply given see the

1514
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:54,529
world they know very well that military

1515
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,570
is very good in breaking things so

1516
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:58,399
basically their offensive capability

1517
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:01,880
that's considered to be part of the

1518
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:05,299
military broader capability but it was

1519
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:09,760
really hard to find the way how military

1520
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:13,820
could be used so my question is that

1521
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,590
what do you think how much military can

1522
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:18,859
actually solve the problems or

1523
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:22,010
challenges the country sab in the cyber

1524
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:24,259
security field at the state level what

1525
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:27,140
is the I don't know how you can answer

1526
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:30,530
that percentage sure or if some naming

1527
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:35,000
capabilities but is there is the key of

1528
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:37,639
solving pressing challenges in the

1529
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,359
military forces or countries should find

1530
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,980
the solutions from other sectors so it's

1531
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,950
pretty much the question that you raised

1532
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:48,160
there that you who you cannot call I

1533
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:50,899
remember very well do you know this guy

1534
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,939
Ghostbusters exactly but one of the

1535
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:54,519
favorite movies when I was a child and

1536
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,349
you know who you cannot call

1537
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,570
Ghostbusters exactly

1538
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:01,490
so is there is this you know the

1539
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,860
capability actually somewhere else and

1540
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:06,830
we are focusing maybe too much to the

1541
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:10,009
military sector or I think the the I

1542
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:11,480
mean it all depends as you've heard

1543
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,920
that's an acceptable answer so the only

1544
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,940
the questions today

1545
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:19,090
first of all III think those who talk

1546
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:21,259
about a whole-of-government response are

1547
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:24,290
dealing with the appropriate way to talk

1548
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:28,850
about not just cyber space issues but

1549
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:31,280
really any national security issue and I

1550
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:34,400
like to use the analogy of a tent if you

1551
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,130
if you prop up a tent with one pole

1552
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,679
and that pole gets knocked out you know

1553
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:42,320
the tents gonna collapse if the tent is

1554
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:45,590
up is held up through a bunch of poles

1555
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,840
you're not dependent on one one tent one

1556
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:50,150
pole holding the bearing the weight of

1557
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,780
the capability and so I think the answer

1558
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:56,480
is the more options that a nation has

1559
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:59,330
and likewise as dr. mr. Rowley mentioned

1560
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,699
earlier this afternoon the more options

1561
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:04,670
that the Alliance has about how we can

1562
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:06,799
respond to things you know there there's

1563
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:10,489
a theory that says essentially the best

1564
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,550
strategy in general is preserving your

1565
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:16,639
options essentially any option any

1566
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:18,920
strategy that requires you to end up

1567
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,500
with fewer options than you started with

1568
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:24,469
should be seriously questioned about

1569
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:26,510
whether that's a valid strategy now life

1570
01:11:24,469 --> 01:11:28,370
isn't like that that you know there's no

1571
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:30,800
loss and there's no trade-offs but I

1572
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:34,900
think that's my response is first of all

1573
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:37,040
if you are using computers and

1574
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:38,659
communications and information systems

1575
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,350
to conduct your military operations

1576
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:44,059
which you are you absolutely need to be

1577
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:47,020
able to operate those in a secure and

1578
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:50,449
reliable and resilient fashion because

1579
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:53,659
that's one of the easiest ways you can

1580
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:56,780
defeat the capabilities and in any other

1581
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:58,460
any other form so defending operating it

1582
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:01,429
reliably and then defending it

1583
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:06,230
appropriately whether of offensive is

1584
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:09,590
the appropriate tool if your nation

1585
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:12,259
needs that pole in your overall national

1586
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:14,179
security cyberspace strategy is really a

1587
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,760
decision for each nation to make on its

1588
01:12:14,179 --> 01:12:18,980
own but let's take very concrete example

1589
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,110
you pointed out in your presentation the

1590
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,809
the power plants case

1591
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,179
yep the military should somehow have a

1592
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:29,330
role in defending this power plant

1593
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:32,239
how can military actually do it isn't it

1594
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:33,920
so that the best knowledge is amongst

1595
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,409
these operators who operate the power

1596
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:39,290
plant and to protect them who has been

1597
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:41,320
have built the IT system for the power

1598
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:44,150
plant so what military can actually do

1599
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,460
that you're making my case right there

1600
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:48,559
which was essentially if I want to

1601
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:51,170
provide protection from

1602
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,730
and attack see attack air attack I can

1603
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:55,970
use that with conventional military

1604
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:59,660
forces to protect it from cyber space

1605
01:12:55,970 --> 01:13:01,880
attack it's not clear to me that it's

1606
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,230
it's an easy reach to say that's an

1607
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,320
appropriate use of military capabilities

1608
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:09,200
I think I think chasing after the

1609
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:13,670
military solution actually is probably

1610
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:16,070
less productive and and a less effective

1611
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:19,760
use of the resources than pursuing other

1612
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:22,190
lines of improvement but but if we can

1613
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,710
go back one of your earlier statements

1614
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:27,410
that every country doesn't need to have

1615
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:29,210
cyber capability does it mean actually

1616
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:31,280
that if there is a power plant that

1617
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:32,920
needs to be protection then another

1618
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,990
country could use their military

1619
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:39,050
capability actually to protect that

1620
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:41,269
well I again I don't think all nails

1621
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:45,470
have to be driven in with military

1622
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:48,470
hammers and this is an example you know

1623
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:51,110
and and you've seen it here in this zone

1624
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:53,390
and and many the newer members of the EU

1625
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:56,900
have benefited from not just the

1626
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:59,150
economic expertise or value that the UAE

1627
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,889
U has brought in terms of investment but

1628
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:05,290
that investment typically came with

1629
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:08,390
capability or capacity building support

1630
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:09,530
through non-military means and even when

1631
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,720
nations join NATO

1632
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:14,690
we provide capability and capacity

1633
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:17,000
building support for the military side

1634
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:20,179
you know it doesn't have to have a

1635
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,250
military solution I'd like to actually

1636
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:27,380
to address the same question to other

1637
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:29,630
panelists what do you think that how how

1638
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,840
many solutions could be found in the

1639
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:37,300
military capabilities for depression

1640
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:41,780
cyber security challenges these days I

1641
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:46,370
can give example from from Israel in

1642
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:52,130
which in Israel the military is

1643
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:57,849
responsible for really specific areas

1644
01:14:52,130 --> 01:15:01,290
and the main responsibility is of

1645
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:04,110
national civilian agency the NASA

1646
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:07,830
cyber Directorate which in case our

1647
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:10,589
power plants get attack gets attack this

1648
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:12,960
Authority is responsible for its

1649
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:15,570
protection and for dealing with the

1650
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:19,620
consequences of the attacks the military

1651
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:21,690
is not ghostbusters yeah yeah who do you

1652
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:23,400
call them yeah and they have they have

1653
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:25,379
their number like an you know a short

1654
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:28,620
short cut for short for a short number

1655
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,360
so every citizen can call and especially

1656
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:34,440
if you are a critical infrastructure

1657
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:38,160
operator or something like that this is

1658
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:43,169
the one authority that you work with no

1659
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:44,820
no military involved number of really

1660
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:46,410
interesting questions here and but the

1661
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:48,299
first one to answer is actually what

1662
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:49,980
would the military be capable off right

1663
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,540
and how much do you want to invest in it

1664
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,870
and what we have seen is that we have

1665
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:55,530
seen a wide range of countries

1666
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:57,210
establishing military cyber

1667
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:59,429
organizations whether these are full

1668
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:01,680
fledged commands or branches of services

1669
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:03,720
around the time actually of austerity

1670
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,280
right you might see this in the post six

1671
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:09,540
in that era but it was also an area

1672
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:12,059
where a wide range of countries were

1673
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:14,130
still facing military budget cuts what

1674
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,130
truly decide a command or another

1675
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:19,520
similar organization was seen as a way

1676
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:22,290
to remain kind of at the forefront of

1677
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,690
technological advancement and military

1678
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:27,600
capability right the idea that hey with

1679
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:30,960
spending a few million we might still be

1680
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:33,120
able to be active in in the military

1681
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,010
domain and I think what many have come

1682
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,650
to realize like hey it's not that easy

1683
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:39,210
and goes also to a conversation that we

1684
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:41,280
had over lunch about hey what are the

1685
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,780
actual requirements to conduct

1686
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,219
operations before we can actually think

1687
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:46,170
about its use and what does it require

1688
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:49,110
to actually establish an organization

1689
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:50,910
what we see is this this funny paradox

1690
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:53,339
that often comes up is that yes the

1691
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:55,139
barriers of entry to achieve any type of

1692
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,120
effect against in any point in time

1693
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,290
against any target in a very

1694
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,420
opportunistic manner

1695
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:01,920
yes that's relatively low and so if we

1696
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,960
would then think about potential force

1697
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,540
projection you actually need relatively

1698
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,580
little right certain actors can now

1699
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,190
which they weren't able to do before

1700
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:12,750
project force truly into other countries

1701
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:15,059
that are far away from them they don't

1702
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:18,510
need that infrastructure yet and the

1703
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:21,600
goes to almost any nation or any nation

1704
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:23,760
that is within that the Alliance that's

1705
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,290
not the type of operation that that you

1706
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,420
want to conduct what you want to conduct

1707
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,310
are specific operations with a specific

1708
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,500
target at a specific point in time that

1709
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:33,750
are strategically valuable whether that

1710
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,790
is for I don't know defensive purposes

1711
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:38,580
pre-emptive preventive strike or compel

1712
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:41,910
ins purposes coercive purposes or more

1713
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:44,040
signaling purposes but this it fits

1714
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:45,960
within a broad set of criteria to meet

1715
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,570
every single criteria whether that's go

1716
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,120
around collateral damage and so on it

1717
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:54,030
requires a disproportionate increase in

1718
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:56,790
requirements and so with that in mind we

1719
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:58,650
see a complete change in landscape it's

1720
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:01,650
like yes I do believe that there is a

1721
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:03,450
wide range of use of potentially using

1722
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:05,969
military cyber operations and where the

1723
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,230
military can be valuable right but I do

1724
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:08,370
believe that there are certain ways

1725
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:11,490
where we can actually think about

1726
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:14,010
pre-emptive and preventive strikes but

1727
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:16,710
requires such an investment that we have

1728
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:19,230
so badly understood so far and both

1729
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:22,470
people are especially people and not

1730
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:25,139
just technical in in and and also in

1731
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:26,820
indeed tooling and and like both exploit

1732
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,770
and implants but I'm also an

1733
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,809
infrastructure understanding the targets

1734
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,520
the amount of investment it is required

1735
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:34,710
to actually understand the target space

1736
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,240
is enormous and then lastly in the

1737
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,340
organizational capacity how can we

1738
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,889
motivate still some individual

1739
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:43,020
flexibility vows many of these people

1740
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:47,070
are still in a kind of rigorous military

1741
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:50,010
environment and I think few it seems few

1742
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:52,380
organizations across the Native Alliance

1743
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:54,240
at least and beyond this well have

1744
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:56,220
actually really got that in place and

1745
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,500
that that's this necessary step to then

1746
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:00,240
think about how we gonna use that so

1747
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,430
you're basically saying that the cyber

1748
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:05,519
capability that should be there is not

1749
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:07,860
actually as he I need what I'm saying is

1750
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,860
indeed that considering the public

1751
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:14,670
investment mates in military cyber

1752
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:17,730
organizations if those figures are truly

1753
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:20,040
reflect the actual amount of money that

1754
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:22,620
is invested in military suborganizations

1755
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:24,090
that will not be enough to actually

1756
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:27,390
operate effectively

1757
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:28,400
I owned so I also remember from your

1758
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:30,980
paper that

1759
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,750
you mentioned that it's not that

1760
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,699
countries have created new cyber

1761
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:37,370
capabilities but they have actually

1762
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:40,280
reorganized the military capabilities

1763
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:43,010
under the name of cyber commando

1764
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,690
what there is the name yes and there are

1765
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:46,610
a number of implications that come with

1766
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:49,669
that right so just due to one final

1767
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:51,889
point on this that can have great

1768
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,120
benefits because actually by rebranding

1769
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,429
you might also make it a more attractive

1770
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,440
environment for potentially young people

1771
01:19:55,429 --> 01:19:58,940
or people who just graduate whatever to

1772
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,889
come in and want to work for it right

1773
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,659
that rebranding and some people will say

1774
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,610
there's actually valuable for some form

1775
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:06,500
of post ring as well right it's

1776
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:09,019
difficult to showcase a capability it is

1777
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,179
difficult to to parade computer codes on

1778
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:13,010
the streets of Moscow but we can show is

1779
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:15,380
the organizational capacity and the

1780
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:17,810
strategies and so on so there is a value

1781
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:19,520
but we've also seen practices that will

1782
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:21,380
have to be changed for example with this

1783
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,500
reorganization trying to put the most

1784
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:26,330
important technical minds in kind of one

1785
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,210
unit it might actually be in an

1786
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:30,650
attractive place for potentially private

1787
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,179
sector companies to actually recruit

1788
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:34,099
from there because now you have a one

1789
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:36,170
shop where you want to go to because you

1790
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,940
know that the organization is pooled if

1791
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:41,750
that happens and there seem to be

1792
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:43,428
countries where that is happening what

1793
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,679
will then see is that actually we see

1794
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:47,530
this kind of brain drain where the

1795
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:51,370
centralization is actually led to

1796
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:54,530
dynamics that no no government wanted

1797
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:57,110
it's always clear that there is not

1798
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:59,449
never enough time for cyber discussions

1799
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:01,610
but let's take we have still eight

1800
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:04,129
minutes to take questions so let's take

1801
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:07,690
questions from the auditorium yes please

1802
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,690
in front here

1803
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,100
thank you isn't there then a place I

1804
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,890
mean to Gil's point about Israel

1805
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:22,880
obviously people working in the in the

1806
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:26,420
civil agency probably went to 8200 there

1807
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:29,870
is a big ecosystem in Israel between

1808
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:32,660
business military and which which export

1809
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:35,599
country has to do Estonia same thing a

1810
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:38,620
very big country has the money like say

1811
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:41,360
America but the medium countries

1812
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:45,050
Britain's Germany it wouldn't be a

1813
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,910
natural solution be the reservists

1814
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:48,800
system but different obviously to what

1815
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,449
we think historically historically the

1816
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,390
reservists is less prepared than the

1817
01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:54,949
soldier but inside but to your point he

1818
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:56,870
would be more prepared because he does

1819
01:21:54,949 --> 01:22:00,469
it on a daily basis and then gets called

1820
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:07,280
wouldn't that be an approach that should

1821
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:11,239
be seriously considered in my opinion

1822
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:15,410
and we did some research on it on the

1823
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:18,589
Israeli case I think the reserve duty

1824
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:23,570
might be a good solution or a good

1825
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:29,750
option in this case as you suggested in

1826
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:34,099
the Israeli case we we do have recorded

1827
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:36,650
in English reserve officers but there

1828
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:43,160
are ones that served in serving in the

1829
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:45,860
military during their the studies in the

1830
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:49,849
university so it's a different kind of

1831
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:52,519
service and then it's it gives a good

1832
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:54,260
solution for the manpower problem

1833
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,750
because the military pays for their

1834
01:22:54,260 --> 01:23:01,190
studies in the university and they're

1835
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:03,770
committed for twice as long at least

1836
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:07,040
twice long service in the military and

1837
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:11,330
they get so highly educated during the

1838
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:14,540
service and they they then is appointed

1839
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:21,530
in the units that needs them the most

1840
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:24,949
and that makes it very it's a it's a

1841
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:30,018
good mechanism for the military to

1842
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:34,259
to preserve the knowledge with him he

1843
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:39,630
pays them to study and then use that

1844
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:41,849
knowledge so I think it can be both both

1845
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:44,729
ways might work in this case even the

1846
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:48,059
the reserves that come to to serve every

1847
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:51,050
few months or years and this we call it

1848
01:23:48,059 --> 01:23:53,909
an academic reserve okay in Israel like

1849
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:55,199
max other question yeah two points of

1850
01:23:53,909 --> 01:24:00,360
that one on the reserve system and then

1851
01:23:55,199 --> 01:24:02,789
on the private sector I fully agree that

1852
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,650
of course it can provide similarly

1853
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:07,079
initial operational capacity can help

1854
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:09,268
with also knowledge exchanges build

1855
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:11,789
broader cultural understanding there is

1856
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:13,380
this terrific Rand report which I

1857
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:15,389
believe was published two three years

1858
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:17,340
ago also talking about the limitations

1859
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:19,110
and one of them is of course that when

1860
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,880
we really think about cyber operations

1861
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:22,320
it's about better understanding your own

1862
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,119
networks than anyone else and better

1863
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,999
understanding your adversary networks

1864
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:28,259
than your adversary does and that means

1865
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:30,119
that we can't have kind of a

1866
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:32,130
plug-and-play solution right you can't

1867
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:34,440
have reservists coming in at the moment

1868
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:36,539
that already there is a problem or that

1869
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,098
you want to go on the offense because it

1870
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:39,780
is about understanding your own network

1871
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:41,639
and your adversaries networks and that

1872
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:43,170
creates some significant limitations

1873
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:45,599
that I think in right number of states

1874
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:46,920
still have to deal with I think the role

1875
01:24:45,599 --> 01:24:48,749
of the private sector is inherent

1876
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,130
whether you're a great like a larger

1877
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:51,329
state whether that's the US or whether

1878
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,860
you're a small state they will

1879
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:55,170
inherently come in and for very very

1880
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:57,598
good reasons I think one of the key

1881
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:59,190
interesting things here is really on how

1882
01:24:57,599 --> 01:25:00,630
are you gonna use private sector tools

1883
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:03,089
and particularly when they are not

1884
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:06,420
developed for military cyber operations

1885
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:08,550
right often we draw an out like we think

1886
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,409
that a typical pentesting is very

1887
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:12,840
similar to how a military operation is

1888
01:25:10,409 --> 01:25:14,129
conducted it's not right they have very

1889
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,840
different incentive structure and

1890
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,420
operate in a very different way one is

1891
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,949
billable hours want to achieve within a

1892
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,599
day whatever we need to come up with a

1893
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:22,829
report all those kind of things the

1894
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:24,599
other it's about stability it

1895
01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:27,900
stealthiness and is ensuring mission

1896
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:29,309
effectiveness it changes the dynamics on

1897
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,018
what kind of tools we want to use and

1898
01:25:29,309 --> 01:25:33,510
how we want to deploy them as well and

1899
01:25:31,019 --> 01:25:35,099
also changes potentially the dynamics on

1900
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,780
what kind of people we might want to use

1901
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:37,600
and how we whether we want to retrain

1902
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,910
them or why do

1903
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,350
to bring in new people altogether and I

1904
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:44,139
think some of those dynamics are

1905
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:45,760
particularly important for those exactly

1906
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,440
those Middle States because there's

1907
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,090
large states as we've known and

1908
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:52,120
unfortunately from leaks such as the

1909
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:54,070
shadow brokers we know that the US can

1910
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:56,080
build their own unique exploit

1911
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:58,450
orchestrators to specifically use it

1912
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,309
their frameworks for certain operations

1913
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:01,929
but many of the middle powers and

1914
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:03,820
certainly small powers don't have that

1915
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,740
capacity so you might have to rely more

1916
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:08,080
on private sector tools that were not

1917
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:10,830
necessarily developed for purely

1918
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:14,230
military implications or applications

1919
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:15,910
right yeah I just want to jump in for a

1920
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:18,280
couple of points my father actually has

1921
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:20,200
last his last assignment as an active

1922
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:22,450
duty US Air Force officer was as an

1923
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,820
adviser to an Air National Guard unit

1924
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:28,300
which provided deployable communications

1925
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:30,969
and information systems and he loved

1926
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:35,260
that experience because actually all of

1927
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:37,060
his staff were people who worked for at

1928
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:39,700
that time was we called it the phone

1929
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:43,120
company they were all telephone company

1930
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:46,030
engineers they worked that mission for

1931
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:49,120
decades okay so they did maybe they only

1932
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:51,400
practiced one weekend a month but they

1933
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,780
did that year and and you're out and so

1934
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,820
they actually developed a very high

1935
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:57,700
level of expertise and I think of you

1936
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:59,320
looking certainly the u.s. the Army

1937
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,780
National Guard the Air National Guard

1938
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:04,030
you will find that's where we start to

1939
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:06,670
bring in some of the depth of specialty

1940
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:09,700
expertise that actually gives us

1941
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:11,560
tremendous essentially depth of capacity

1942
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:14,320
and I think there's two points from that

1943
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:16,930
why were the phone company guys doing it

1944
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,179
once a month because it helped with an

1945
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:21,490
additional pension and particularly in

1946
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,440
the IT world where turnover and rotation

1947
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:26,050
happens a lot there can be very

1948
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,059
attractive benefits of sticking with it

1949
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:30,220
for a few decades so I think actually

1950
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:32,830
you'll find the skill sets can be quite

1951
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:35,140
easily exportable I think it's a great

1952
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:36,940
model and I totally support that being

1953
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:41,020
used sorry it sorry to differ but I

1954
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:43,030
think it has a lot of benefits comment I

1955
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:45,190
think we actually largely agree here

1956
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:48,040
right as I was saying it's useful for

1957
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:49,540
initial capacity building is useful for

1958
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,460
knowledge sharing for cultural

1959
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:53,440
understanding all these dimensions

1960
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,610
but we have to be very careful of

1961
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,440
thinking that this can be a

1962
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,700
plug-and-play solution yeah but they can

1963
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,070
come in at the moment that we

1964
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:02,250
desperately need them that's too late no

1965
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:05,410
they have to they have to train that

1966
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:07,900
mission on a regular basis I can't just

1967
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:10,900
come in at the type of the time of the

1968
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:13,179
crisis I'm sure that there are many

1969
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:15,250
other questions in the auditorium but

1970
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:16,780
unfortunately the dime is up and they

1971
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:19,390
have to finish here because otherwise

1972
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:22,330
the CCDC will not ask me in the future

1973
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:25,150
to motivate them so let's finish here

1974
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,710
and if you have any other questions

1975
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,730
there are many events around the world

1976
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,980
on cybersecurity

1977
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:32,349
and if you are not going to take part of

1978
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:34,000
this the next year there is another

1979
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:36,520
event in Tallinn so keep your questions

1980
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,650
for about the year so thank you very

1981
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,480
much and let's keep Peak applause to the

1982
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:42,339
panelists

1983
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,339
[Applause]
