1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
good afternoon welcome to this session

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,480
of the title law in action defending a

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,120
nation in cyberspace joining me as the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,130
speakers are Jeff Joseph from the United

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
States Naval Academy Kenneth crear chefs

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,260
key from the University of Helsinki and

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,539
cari Gasca from the NATO CCDC OE so

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,430
first a few organizational remarks I

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,080
will introduce all the speakers and the

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,180
topics that they will focus on in their

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,159
presentations each of the speakers has

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,619
15 to 20 minutes for his or her

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,689
presentation and after each presentation

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,090
we will take two questions related

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,160
directly to that presentation it should

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,170
leave us with some time after all of the

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,148
presentations or you can ask other

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,450
questions to multiple speakers at the

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,850
same time so let's proceed with the

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,289
first presentation so I would like we

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,660
would like to connect the title of this

22
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,280
panel with the presentation I think that

23
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,669
in the discussions whether and how

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,930
international law applies to cyberspace

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,940
people sometimes forget that it's the

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,309
states and their policies that shape the

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,989
law the states are testing the limits

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,730
and jeff has written a great article

29
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,429
about the u.s. operational concept

30
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,830
called defend Ford from 2018 and what

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:14,939
limits international law imposes on this

32
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,560
operational concept Jeff so thank you so

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,860
much for having me I'm really excited to

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,869
be here I have to give a few disclaimers

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,400
first I'm a lawyer so I like giving

36
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,100
disclaimers I'll probably have a lot of

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,439
them first is that I'm speaking only on

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,630
my own behalf not on behalf of the Naval

39
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,899
Academy Department of Navy Department of

40
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,199
Defense nobody else the second is that

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,729
I'm going to be talking about DoD

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,880
operational concepts and strategies and

43
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,770
cyber which obviously there is a good

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,929
deal of classified material involved

45
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,619
overall in cyber that is not what this

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,049
is about

47
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,350
this is all based on publicly available

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,799
documents through that DoD is released

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,298
and media coverage so this is all public

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,939
domain information that I'll be talking

51
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,490
about and the third and this is really

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,158
what I wanted to drive home what the

53
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,549
overall topic of my paper and concept is

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,610
is that I'm not looking to have the

55
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,800
normative discussion about whether

56
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,140
defending forward is

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,150
appropriate whether we should be what

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,609
I'm looking at as a lawyer is what are

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,200
the limits on defending forward now I

60
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,850
think there are a lot of incredibly

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,829
important normative discussions that

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,450
need to be had and I encourage all of

63
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,150
you to have them but what we're going to

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,489
talk about today is what defend forward

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,290
is and what international law allows so

66
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,540
as was said I'm at the Naval Academy I

67
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,280
was a civilian or I'm a civilian

68
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,950
professor but I was in the private

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,110
sector representing companies on cyber

70
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,600
security matters when I got to the Naval

71
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,220
Academy one thing that I learned is

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,710
there are a lot of acronyms in the

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,500
military acronyms that I have no idea

74
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,540
google them all the time and they're

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,750
actually useful and the most useful

76
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,579
acronym that I've seen is BL UF which I

77
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,070
had no idea what it meant until I got to

78
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,470
the Naval Academy and that's bottom line

79
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,290
up front so my BL UF for this

80
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,650
presentation is that international law

81
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,299
provides significant leeway or nations

82
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,330
including the United States to defend

83
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,040
forward in cyberspace so what I first

84
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,290
want to do is talk about what defend

85
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
forward is because this concept came out

86
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,980
a little over a year ago and there was a

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,299
big brouhaha in the press about what

88
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,030
what's defend forward does that mean

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,070
that we're going to be changing the

90
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,950
rules of international law and it's

91
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,769
really much more nuanced and far less of

92
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,380
a magnitude than was initially reported

93
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,930
so to understand it you have to first

94
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,350
understand this concept of continuous

95
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,940
engagement and persistent engagement

96
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,829
those that's really the strategy that

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,140
came out through the cyber commands

98
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,250
vision statement in 2018 as well as a

99
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,529
DoD is unclassified summary of its cyber

100
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,170
strategy and what continuous engagement

101
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,840
basically says is that we need to impose

102
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,299
friction and costs on our adversaries so

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,330
that's the strategy of continuous

104
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,910
engagement but how do we do that that's

105
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,380
where defend forward comes and one of

106
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,649
the things that defend forward has been

107
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,959
referred to what is as a strategy and

108
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,020
it's not it's an operational concept

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,169
that supports persistent engagement and

110
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,818
in the Cyber Command vision

111
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,219
Cyber Command wrote that we want to

112
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:33,710
defend forward as close as possible to

113
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:38,479
the origin of adversary activity and

114
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,489
that's right we seen as a pretty big

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,400
statement and a shift from previous

116
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,000
statements that the DoD is made in 2011

117
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,520
and 2015 in strategy documents where it

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,939
is focused on what's known as active

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,289
defence or active cyber defense and the

120
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:56,389
key difference here is we're talking

121
00:04:54,289 --> 00:05:00,199
about being as close as possible to the

122
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:03,229
origin so what this strongly implies is

123
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,360
not just looking at the DoD's perimeter

124
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,120
and not looking once you get to the DoD

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,939
Network now where is as close as

126
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,500
possible to the origin there's not

127
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,979
really a direct statement as to what

128
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,129
that is you could think it might be

129
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:23,449
within us other networks non DoD within

130
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:27,080
the US could be in the red zone where

131
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:31,099
there where the adversary is operating

132
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,080
it also could be in the zone of a third

133
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,960
party where the adversary is operating

134
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,080
but it's clearly saying where we're

135
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,960
going to look at other areas where we

136
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,430
need to defend forward now the aims of

137
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,859
defend forward this was really

138
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,190
articulated in this unclassified summary

139
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,050
that DoD released of its cyber strategy

140
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,050
and that's again disrupting or halting

141
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,819
the malicious activity including

142
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,490
activity that falls below the level of

143
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:01,789
armed conflict and that's key here so I

144
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,270
will be the first to admit when I talk

145
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:08,949
when I teach about international law

146
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,599
applied to cyber my go-to my first

147
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,560
instinct is to start talking about self

148
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,789
defense under you said bellum and

149
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,469
necessity and proportionality of self

150
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,360
defense what's an armed attack and those

151
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,699
are all incredibly important discussions

152
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,310
to have but the reality that we're

153
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,409
facing is that a lot of our threats are

154
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,719
underneath this armed attack level

155
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,789
underneath the use of force but that

156
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,229
doesn't make them any less significant

157
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,690
and there's something that needs to be

158
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,520
addressed so that's clearly one of the

159
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,350
issues that defend forward is looking at

160
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,520
is how do we address these sub are

161
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,190
attack issues so that's what I want to

162
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,060
do today is talk about the international

163
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,800
law assessment of defend forward so the

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,380
clearest indication that I've seen

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,900
publicly of what defend forward is came

166
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,820
from a newsletter the cyber commands

167
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,310
public affairs office put out late last

168
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,490
year where I talked about three lines of

169
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,250
effort of defend forward positioning

170
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,500
warning and influence and so what I want

171
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,530
to do is go through these three lines of

172
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,380
effort and talk about what limits and

173
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,200
what capabilities are permitted under

174
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,800
international law so the first line of

175
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,510
effort is accounts called positioning so

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,540
that's talking about this forward cyber

177
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,880
posture that you can leverage to

178
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,170
persistently degrade the adversary as

179
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,790
effectiveness and that so that's the

180
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,160
that's the description and I think it

181
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,430
really needs to be broken down into two

182
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,250
different activities to really do an

183
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,870
international law analysis of it the

184
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,630
first would be establishing that

185
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,390
position so what do you do to establish

186
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,150
the position whether it's just preparing

187
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,030
that would probably be the least raise

188
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,979
the fewest legal issues all the way to

189
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,349
leveraging that position which might

190
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,990
raise more issues that we have to deal

191
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,750
with under international law so if

192
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,190
you're just establishing the position

193
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,780
some legal scholars might say depending

194
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,010
on what you're doing that that's going

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,049
to be fine we don't need to worry about

196
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,060
the international law justifications but

197
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,970
if you're establishing a position for

198
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,650
example by implanting malware that could

199
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,390
be seen at least by some was raising

200
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,280
some sovereignty issues and so that's

201
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,870
that's something that we really have to

202
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,030
address and then separately what we need

203
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,830
to address is if you're actually

204
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:36,270
leveraging that position to cause harm

205
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,968
whether it's erasing data make degrading

206
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,429
the capability of a certain operation

207
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,080
that could be seen as raising some

208
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,479
sovereignty issues so how do we deal

209
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,460
with that if we're moving to a point

210
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,640
where you could be dealing with some

211
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,580
international law issues and the

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,699
clearest answer to this would be count

213
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,850
measures so and that this was discussed

214
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,010
in the President's speech earlier today

215
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,040
I think countermeasures are increasingly

216
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:08,130
being seen as an option to deal with all

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,760
of these sub armed attacks sub use of

218
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,830
force threats that we're facing and for

219
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,270
many issues that the United States faces

220
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:22,110
countermeasures are very a viable way to

221
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:25,079
deal with them so there are limits on

222
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,660
countermeasures first is that basically

223
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,500
you have to have you can only exercise a

224
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,880
countermeasure if the person who if the

225
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,290
state that you're targeting with

226
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,810
countermeasures is committed and

227
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,780
internationally legally wrongful act and

228
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:44,849
the goal of the countermeasure is to

229
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,560
stop that violation so you might first

230
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,750
see this as being a significant limit

231
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,760
and in many ways it is but given the

232
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,690
nature of the threats that we're facing

233
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,120
the persistent attacks that we're facing

234
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,040
I think it's probably less of a limit in

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,340
a number of the situations that we're

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,230
facing because these are the these are

237
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,580
constant attacks that are not stopping

238
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,740
the adversary is always trying to harm

239
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,810
our networks harm our systems from our

240
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,790
data harm our people so the

241
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,560
countermeasures I think more likely will

242
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,660
be continuous and I think this requires

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,180
a bit of a shift from how we've thought

244
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,319
about cyber legal issues before where

245
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,920
we've thought about them as these

246
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,020
discrete episodic events which in some

247
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,370
cases they are but in a lot of cases it

248
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,220
just may keep happening so the

249
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,400
countermeasures just as the attacks are

250
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,350
persistent that I think the

251
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,770
countermeasures also can have this

252
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,950
continuous impact countermeasures also

253
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:47,819
have to be proportionate and so this

254
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,160
does not mean that you have to your

255
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,530
countermeasure has to take the same form

256
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,990
as the initial harm that you experienced

257
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,550
but the rough magnitude at least the

258
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,250
under one and there are a few different

259
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,439
interpretations of what proportionality

260
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,320
would mean but the magnitude has to be

261
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,750
commensurate with the injury suffered so

262
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,610
I think that

263
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,470
that that's something that we always

264
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,029
have to keep in mind but I think again

265
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,860
depending on what level of

266
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,899
countermeasures I think that could that

267
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,480
would be reasonable given the harm that

268
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:20,959
we're suffering the next line of effort

269
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,060
is warning so the way that Cyber Command

270
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,670
has defined it as enhanced warning of

271
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,819
adversary actions intentions and

272
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,709
capabilities to better defend government

273
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:33,979
and civilian networks data and platform

274
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:36,199
so this gathering information about

275
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,839
cyber threats and using the information

276
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:42,500
about cyber threats would fall under the

277
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,230
warning the warning line so a lot of

278
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,699
warning are a lot of what would fall

279
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,639
under warning I don't think would

280
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,979
necessarily raise any significant

281
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,680
concerns under international law I would

282
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,220
say if there's gathering open source

283
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,258
information and I can I I think there's

284
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,259
a lot that is available open source and

285
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:05,660
I think that would raise no concerns

286
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:07,939
under international law when we get to

287
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,069
espionage now that's where there's

288
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,620
probably at least some controversy at

289
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:16,519
this point there's obviously no per se

290
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,819
rule again or that against peacetime

291
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,149
espionage although I would say once

292
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:25,699
there's more widespread surveillance and

293
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,670
data collection there at least some who

294
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:34,128
might argue that that strays into the

295
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:36,979
lane of violating international law so I

296
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:39,860
think it would so depending on what form

297
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,930
the information gathering is taking that

298
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,610
could raise some concerns also what

299
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,258
would raise some concerns and under

300
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,889
international law would be if while

301
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:51,110
gathering the information we were to

302
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:54,949
cause damage to the systems that at

303
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,620
least under some frames of analysis

304
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:02,420
could create international legal issues

305
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:06,500
so that's also a limit to keep in mind

306
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:10,099
when conducting warning operations the

307
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,439
final prong would defend for it is

308
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,439
influence and the way Cyber Command

309
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:18,170
defines this is encouraging stability by

310
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:19,400
disabusing adversaries of the idea they

311
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,150
can operate within

312
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,060
in cyberspace so this again depending on

313
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,959
what form it takes a lot of the this

314
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:34,459
could be anything from diplomacy to

315
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,740
sanctions to expelling diplomats closing

316
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,850
proper closing embassies those sorts of

317
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:43,490
things and those would all I would say

318
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:47,210
fall under the category of recursion

319
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:50,180
which are unfriendly acts that don't in

320
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,610
and up themselves raise legal concerns

321
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,880
now there are other ways to exercise

322
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,950
influence that could be more creative

323
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,800
for example if there were to be a

324
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,980
message and that this is from public

325
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,670
media media reports a message sent to

326
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,380
individual cyber operators in other

327
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,060
nations not with the threat but just a

328
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,550
message essentially letting them know

329
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,400
that we know they're there

330
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,699
that also could be something though that

331
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,100
would be influenced I think just sending

332
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,930
a message and not raising a threat I

333
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,560
don't think that in and of itself would

334
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,500
raise any significant legal concerns

335
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,790
however if you start threatening them

336
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,490
those sorts of things that's where there

337
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,650
could be humanitarian issues so there

338
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,250
would be some limits on that obviously

339
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,959
if you influence by causing damage as we

340
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,810
talked about before that would have to

341
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,990
fall under law of countermeasures or any

342
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,579
other legal justifications so the bottom

343
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,230
line that I wanted to that I started

344
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,130
with at the beginning of this talk is

345
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:58,640
that there is significant leeway even

346
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,120
though we're even if we're not suffering

347
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,350
and are experiencing an armed attack or

348
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,400
a use of force there still is

349
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:12,320
significantly way to exercise measures

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:14,720
to fight this persistent threat that

351
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,470
we're facing and I think defend forward

352
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,110
is of very is a step in that direction

353
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,210
of recognizing that we can't just have

354
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:28,940
our legal analysis and our operational

355
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:31,430
analysis look at sort of the the awful

356
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,670
sort of Pearl Harbor cyber Pearl Harbor

357
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,170
scenario

358
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,449
it's been talked about for years which

359
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,849
hopefully we don't experience but

360
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,910
instead what we need to do is adjust

361
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,720
both our legal and operational thinking

362
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:48,390
to analyze these persistent threats that

363
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,130
we're facing and I think that under

364
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,439
international law we do have we

365
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,450
obviously face limits but we also do

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,970
have significant leeway to address them

367
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,670
and most importantly prevent them from

368
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,090
happening in the first place so with

369
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,959
that I think that that's what I have for

370
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:14,640
now and happy to take questions

371
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:16,740
afterward so to give you some time to

372
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,819
think about your questions I already

373
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,310
prepared one for Jeff so my question is

374
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,900
about justifying some of those more

375
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,510
intrusive activities as countermeasures

376
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,100
positioning the positioning heading so

377
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,230
the countermeasures they are defining

378
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,080
the articles on state responsibilities

379
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,640
but I think they are defined they're

380
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,790
pretty restrictive Lee there's a lot of

381
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,010
conditions they're made quite difficult

382
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,050
to invoke it's a self-help measure and

383
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,730
the UK attorney in general has already

384
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,400
stated last year that some of the

385
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,320
conditions they just couldn't apply to

386
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,300
countermeasures when it comes to cyber

387
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,760
operations so do you think that the

388
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,010
defence forward concept will also have

389
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,620
an impact on the open areas in the

390
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,360
United States or elsewhere I think so

391
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,030
and I hope so because I think they're I

392
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,810
agree with the UK Attorney General I

393
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:13,230
think the one of the big concerns was

394
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:16,589
the notification requirement of having

395
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,800
to notify of exercising countermeasures

396
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:23,639
and that clearly is not something that

397
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,950
could easily be applied in cyber I but I

398
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,870
also think that for some of the

399
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,720
requirements for countermeasures you

400
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:34,979
could still comply just rethinking how

401
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,250
you frame it so for example when the

402
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,950
countermeasure is has to be intended to

403
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,890
cease the unlawful activity if you look

404
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,049
at it as if you look at the unlawful

405
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,610
activity as one discrete event and that

406
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,529
discrete-event has stopped and isn't

407
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,238
happening then that might be difficult

408
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:54,239
to justify but if you look at what

409
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:56,639
you're trying to stop as this continued

410
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,309
campaign I think that that's a way that

411
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:03,799
would justify these more these

412
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,799
longer-term countermeasures thank you

413
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:13,860
okay sonic the guy in the fourth row

414
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,480
hi my name is Jeffrey Kooskia I'm a

415
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,189
lecturer in international law at the

416
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,830
University of Krakow and I have

417
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,269
basically two questions would dig a

418
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,879
little bit on the question of

419
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,700
sovereignty so you you're saying about

420
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:29,850
that the concept of defending forward

421
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,070
can be justified by recourse to counter

422
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,498
measures however counter measures would

423
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,939
presuppose I would say that you know

424
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:41,129
this activity is considered as wrongful

425
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,080
subjects to to these justification of

426
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:45,480
come to measures so is your

427
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,629
understanding of the u.s. position as

428
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,669
implying that you know the counter

429
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:55,678
measures can be taken only in in

430
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:59,789
response to a previous wrongful act or

431
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,159
is it more to be read along the lines of

432
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:04,889
what the UK Attorney General has said

433
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,649
that there is no question of sovereignty

434
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:09,479
in cyberspace at all and therefore low

435
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:12,359
level activities that would have been

436
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,249
taken just don't fall into this category

437
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,519
of countermeasures because they do not

438
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:20,340
constitute a wrongful act in the first

439
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,649
place thank you yeah so that's a good

440
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,090
question and I'm not again I'm not

441
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,219
speaking for the United States position

442
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:31,340
on anything I'm speaking for my position

443
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:35,669
on it and I I would say that depending

444
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,199
depending on what the Act is I I might

445
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,970
just have a different framing of what

446
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,730
would constitute a sovereignty violation

447
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,759
and there still I mean there are some

448
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,269
people who would say that even

449
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,320
interference in the elections with

450
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,029
interference and voting equipment that

451
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,990
sort of thing some might say that's not

452
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:55,619
a violation of either sovereignty or

453
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,269
non-intervention I would strongly

454
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,280
disagree with that

455
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:01,830
so I still think that

456
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,070
i-i think you could reconcile the UK

457
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,379
Attorney General's position but not

458
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,950
necessarily say that these are not

459
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,240
sovereignty violations so I think it

460
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,600
partly depends on what the

461
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,210
countermeasure actually is so the

462
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,060
countermeasures that I would I mean if

463
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,340
you start talking about actually causing

464
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,690
damage to equipment I think that gets

465
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,760
close enough to the line that I would

466
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,170
I'm a lawyer so I tend to be risk-averse

467
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,240
I would probably want to be able to

468
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,710
justify that as a kind of measure but I

469
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,710
think it can be is justifiable

470
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,470
so you mentioned in your speech about

471
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,060
countermeasures such as expelling

472
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,910
diplomats which would work against

473
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,409
potential state actors but my question

474
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,000
is how we're defending forward work in

475
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,980
regards to non-state actors and you have

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
like an example of a countermeasure we

477
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,610
can do when facing a non-state actor yes

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,850
so I and I think that's gonna I think

479
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:04,159
that that's going to be the topic of the

480
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,550
next presentation so I'll defer to my

481
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,530
colleague on on that but but I I mean I

482
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:13,040
think attribution is key I mean I think

483
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,379
be I think that that that's where you

484
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,690
you need to have have attribution to be

485
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:23,230
able to do that okay I think we can take

486
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,230
one more question

487
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,260
hi sir cadet Brian Kenner Westpoint one

488
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,960
of the specific points you had was about

489
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,658
a warning and gathering intelligence so

490
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,880
do you think that if say the US with the

491
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,830
defending forward were to gather

492
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,240
intelligence on foreign citizens without

493
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,820
their knowledge in order to try to

494
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,250
predict an attack coming towards us

495
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,809
would that cross some line of an

496
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,830
internationally wrongful act or would

497
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:54,570
that be okay gathering information on

498
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,110
non-us citizens not in the United States

499
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,350
yes

500
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:02,399
no I mean but that's we do that I mean

501
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,100
we but that's I mean that yeah I I think

502
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,590
that's I mean that's that would be

503
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,019
espionage though I mean we're thinking

504
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,629
for for me that wouldn't raise concerns

505
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,309
I think others might disagree with me on

506
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,289
that point but I I mean I think just

507
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,260
generally if it's just traditional

508
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:20,850
signals intelligence as law if we're

509
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,039
going after people obviously who are in

510
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,580
the United States or US persons that's a

511
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,100
whole different story

512
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,230
so thank you and let's let's continue

513
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,590
with with the idea of loving law in

514
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,480
action I would say that the issue with

515
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,668
some publications on international law

516
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,860
and cyberspace is that sometimes they

517
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:42,870
are really thorough on the on the legal

518
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,939
side but when you read them you ask

519
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,850
yourself where's this fiber in it where

520
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,620
are the facts but that's why we like to

521
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,689
kind of abstract and also the paper so

522
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,729
much because the legal analysis is so

523
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,090
focused and relevant on one particular

524
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,740
incident he selected the Samsun incident

525
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:04,110
and he demonstrated how international

526
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,760
law applied to it thank you hello my

527
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,860
name is Kenneth Khrushchev ski I'm a

528
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,440
doctoral student in law at the

529
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,570
University of Helsinki as well as being

530
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,450
just a regular corporate lawyer at the

531
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,370
finished business law firm the subject

532
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,279
of my research is international law

533
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:23,459
governing below the threshold of use of

534
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,919
force cyber operations I'm honored to be

535
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,620
speaking before all of you today and for

536
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,419
the opportunity to learn from so many

537
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,610
distinguished scholars and professionals

538
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,279
in the cyber field this is my first

539
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,699
saikhan so I'm very excited to be here

540
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,700
speaking

541
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,070
the topic of my presentation today is

542
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,279
the ransomware campaign that came to

543
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,070
international attention in March 2018 at

544
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:53,740
that time the government of a major

545
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,490
American city Atlanta was targeted by a

546
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,289
sophisticated ransomware campaign

547
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,990
Atlanta's main courts called the busiest

548
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:04,480
court in the American southeast was

549
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:07,029
unable to validate warrants police

550
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,429
officers were forced to shut forced to

551
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:11,320
issue citations by hand and the city's

552
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:14,590
employment application portal was shut

553
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,770
down most crucially years of digital

554
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,220
files were rendered inaccessible the

555
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,600
attack was costly its perpetrators

556
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,260
demanded 51,000 dollars to restore

557
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,340
Atlanta's systems to full functionality

558
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,000
but the city followed the advice of

559
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,570
federal authorities and refused payment

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,640
one month later

561
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,710
Atlanta had spent over two and a half

562
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,270
million to restore its systems and an

563
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,899
additional nine and a half million was

564
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:42,100
later requested however Atlanta was not

565
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:44,110
alone in its misery

566
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,178
the same hacking group and malware were

567
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,039
implicated in attacks on hospital and

568
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:50,250
health service providers and municipal

569
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,870
governments across the United States

570
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,690
while other similar attacks like wanna

571
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,770
cry petia and not petia were much larger

572
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:01,179
scale events Samsom ransomware attacks

573
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,879
also deserve an international law

574
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,740
analysis and because its effects

575
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,789
manifested in a single state that

576
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,440
analysis is perhaps more straightforward

577
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,510
this presentation considers the attacks

578
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,220
on health care providers and municipal

579
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,370
governments through the lens of the

580
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,990
Tallinn manual first I will discuss the

581
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,840
Samsom ransomware and the group behind

582
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:24,370
it then I will explain how the incidents

583
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,250
might be classified under international

584
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:30,989
law finally I will discuss the possible

585
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,990
responses available to the United States

586
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,010
as you can see here on this slide there

587
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,289
were many victims of these attacks

588
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,940
primarily the group targeted

589
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:46,299
municipalities such as the cities of

590
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,370
Atlanta Georgia Newark New Jersey as

591
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,670
well as the port of San Diego and the

592
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,760
Colorado Department of Transportation

593
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:56,170
also healthcare providers were affected

594
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,010
specifically hospitals in Los Angeles

595
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,900
Wichita Kansas and Omaha Nebraska as

596
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:05,320
well as some medical services companies

597
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:09,550
in Maryland and Illinois in total there

598
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,350
were over 200 victims u.s. six million

599
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,570
dollars was made in ransom payments and

600
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:18,820
it there were at least an additional 30

601
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:20,770
million in losses the Sam Sam ransomware

602
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,550
was unique in that it was directly

603
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,510
targeted the perpetrators chose

604
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,669
specifically chose these health care

605
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,230
providers and municipalities and once

606
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,770
they had access to the systems they

607
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,350
manually encrypted files they then left

608
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:39,910
a slightly apologetic ransom note

609
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:41,500
demanding several bitcoins in ransom the

610
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:45,630
ransom was set at an amount that would

611
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,630
be deemed affordable to the victims

612
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,140
initially it was reported that the group

613
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,530
behind it was deemed gold Lowell and was

614
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:00,309
suspected to reside in Eastern Europe

615
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:04,050
however on November 26 2018 two Iranian

616
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:07,389
Nationals were indicted for the crime

617
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:10,919
not surprisingly Iran has not extradited

618
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,920
these individuals to the United States

619
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,500
for a cyber operation such as the samsam

620
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,020
ransomware campaign to constitute an

621
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,090
internationally wrongful act it must be

622
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,639
a breach of an international obligation

623
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:31,990
oh - in other states and it must be

624
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:35,200
attributable to a state setting aside

625
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,029
the question of attribution attribution

626
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,039
for a moment I will first question

627
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:40,240
whether the Sam SEM campaign was a

628
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,570
breach of an international obligation

629
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,210
owed by one state to another in the

630
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,039
cyber context the most relevant breaches

631
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:53,220
of international obligation are these

632
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:56,020
for use of force prohibited intervention

633
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,529
violation of sovereignty and a violation

634
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,809
of the duty of due diligence I will

635
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:03,580
examine the first three but due to the

636
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,168
time constraints of this presentation I

637
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,399
will omit discussion of due diligence

638
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:11,080
because that is a bit tricky to discuss

639
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,850
and doesn't apply to the Sam Sam attacks

640
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,980
because as we will see no state is

641
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:20,260
directly implicated the UN Charter

642
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,690
prohibits the use or threat of use of

643
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,309
force by one State against the

644
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,100
territorial integrity or political

645
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,809
independence of another while the

646
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,449
threshold for what constitutes a use of

647
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,418
force in cyberspace is unsettled the

648
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,730
Tallinn manual proposes eight factors

649
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,350
that states are likely to consider which

650
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,850
I will discuss in relation to the Sam

651
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,889
Sam operations severity is considered

652
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,469
the most important factor and crucially

653
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,529
the overall severity of the Sam Sam

654
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,450
attacks was low while the potential for

655
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,340
serious harm to result from the

656
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,470
disruption of hospital and municipal

657
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,459
services is high and none of the

658
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:02,919
incidents did such harm actually occur

659
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,020
secondly immediacy the consequences of

660
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,600
the Sam Sam attacks did not follow

661
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:11,710
immediately from the cyber activities in

662
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,689
most cases the penetration of affected

663
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,490
systems occurred weeks before the ransom

664
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,309
notice was directed to the victim and

665
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,440
the monetary costs actually incurred by

666
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,450
the victims to recover data and restore

667
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,340
their systems followed weeks or months

668
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,650
thereafter

669
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,870
thirdly directness the effects of the

670
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,520
Samsom attacks were not directly

671
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,010
connected to the underlying cyber

672
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,080
activity while the attacks did have

673
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,050
indirect consequences in the form of

674
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,169
costs incurred to restore backed up data

675
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,820
and to implement improved security the

676
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,190
directness of the cause and effects is

677
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,110
in no way comparable to the direct harm

678
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:53,030
for example suffered by a kinetic

679
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:55,100
explosion the attacks were indeed

680
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,780
invasive Gould Lowell did invasively

681
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,449
probe the networks of municipal

682
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,740
governments and health care providers

683
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,360
however these were not top-secret

684
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,010
networks and they were not it

685
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,429
necessarily intended to have the highest

686
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,800
level of security for instance Atlanta's

687
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:14,780
emergency response networks were not

688
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:17,690
touched measurability of effects is also

689
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,820
a problem with these attacks the effects

690
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,890
cannot be calculated with certainty even

691
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,409
if a numerical sum can be affixed to

692
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,160
some of the costs to improve security in

693
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,760
the future there is no suggestion that

694
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,580
these incidents had a military character

695
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,530
no States military was implicated nor

696
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,300
was the American military the target of

697
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:43,070
any of the attacks state involvement no

698
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,899
state is publicly alleged to have been

699
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:49,720
involved in the directly or indirectly

700
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,980
and finally presumptive legality

701
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,370
certainly the the reconnaissance and

702
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,460
network probing activities of the group

703
00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:00,409
are very similar to espionage and

704
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,850
espionage is not per se regulated under

705
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:07,310
international law so on consideration of

706
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,740
each of these eight factors the attacks

707
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:15,560
failed to meet the criteria of a use of

708
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:18,200
force a cyber operation that falls below

709
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,700
the use-of-force threshold may still be

710
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,600
a breach of the customary international

711
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,180
law principle of non intervention in the

712
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,510
cyber context the principle prohibits

713
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:32,180
coercive an intervention by cyber means

714
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:34,299
by one state entity in internal or

715
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,669
external affairs of another

716
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:39,489
as an intervention consists of two

717
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,619
elements it relates to the internal or

718
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:45,009
external affairs of a state and it is of

719
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:47,589
coercive nature Samsom attacks do not

720
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:49,389
contain both of these elements while

721
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:51,249
disturbing the operations of municipal

722
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:53,769
courts and state transportation

723
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:56,320
officials is clearly an intervention in

724
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,629
the internal affairs of the u.s. it is

725
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,580
not coercive in the strict legal sense

726
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:04,289
that it was designed to compel the u.s.

727
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,329
to adopt policies regarding those

728
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:09,639
particular internal affairs it wasn't

729
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:11,529
designed to compel the u.s. to adopt a

730
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:13,359
municipal court or transportation

731
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:16,200
policies it was designed to compel the

732
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,199
u.s. to pay money

733
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,659
the same same attacks could also be a

734
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,450
violation of the United States

735
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:31,390
sovereignty a violent violation of

736
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,240
sovereignty can be either a violation of

737
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,160
territorial borders or an interference

738
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,430
or usurpation of an inherently

739
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,140
governmental function the talent manual

740
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,090
proposes that causing a loss of

741
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,130
functionality by cyber means is

742
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,830
sufficient to constitute a violation of

743
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:50,560
territorial borders samsam attacks

744
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,169
O'Dell undoubtedly did this that was

745
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,639
their whole purpose moreover the attacks

746
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,800
targeted inherently governmental

747
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,430
functions those of courts and of the

748
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,020
police thus it can be concluded that the

749
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,720
Ransom or campaign was certainly a

750
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,850
violation of sovereignty and if

751
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,860
attributable to a state it would

752
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,290
constitute an internationally wrongful

753
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,399
act which then brings this presentation

754
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:17,350
to a discussion of attribution as we all

755
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,040
know attribution is especially difficult

756
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:23,290
in cyberspace but based on publicly

757
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,320
available information we can rule out

758
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:29,680
that the samsam attacks were either the

759
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,450
acts of state organs or were the acts of

760
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,110
state organs placed at the disposal of

761
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:37,150
another state however it is still

762
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,159
possible under international law that

763
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,680
the acts of non-state groups can be

764
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:48,880
attributed to a state under certain

765
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:51,370
circumstances X by non-state actors are

766
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,680
attributable to a state if the non-state

767
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,810
actor is acting on the instructions of a

768
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,360
state or acting under the direction and

769
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,770
control of a state

770
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,110
this latter implies that the state

771
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,760
determines the execution and course of a

772
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,870
cyber operation that has the authority

773
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,639
to order its commencement and cessation

774
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,049
now as I keep saying as far as I can

775
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,020
determine from publicly available

776
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,669
sources of information as I am just a

777
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,460
civilian lawyer and don't really know

778
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:21,069
what is going on behind the scenes gold

779
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,630
law was not acting on the instruction or

780
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,600
under the direction and control of a

781
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:28,740
state so we're not able to attribute its

782
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,739
actions to a state

783
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,630
because I have hopefully I have

784
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,630
established that although the attacks

785
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:38,700
were a violation of US sovereignty they

786
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,740
are not attributable to estates and

787
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,889
cannot be considered an internationally

788
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:46,520
wrongful act so what are the possible

789
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,560
responses of the United States

790
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,860
international law provides for general

791
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,560
possibilities countermeasures the plea

792
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:59,570
of necessity self-defense or taking

793
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,570
action in self-defense and rhetoric

794
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,000
countermeasures are unlawful actions but

795
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,530
for the fact that they are taken in

796
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,750
response to another States

797
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,850
internationally unlawful act and are

798
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,280
designed to terminate that act or compel

799
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,370
the attributable States to make

800
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,900
reparations

801
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:22,290
however the object of countermeasures

802
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,330
must be a state and it is not possible

803
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,900
to attribute the samsam attacks to a

804
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,850
state there must also be an

805
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,970
internationally wrongful act to justify

806
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:35,279
countermeasures and even if there was in

807
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,990
this case the countermeasures have to be

808
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,610
limited to ensuring that the unlawful

809
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:44,100
act stops painting absurds guarantees of

810
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,050
non-repetition and compelling the

811
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,560
responsible state to make reparations

812
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:54,050
you cannot take countermeasures for a

813
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,049
purely punitive or retaliatory reason

814
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,240
the US would be wise to avoid taking

815
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,250
countermeasures in this situation as by

816
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:08,250
doing so it would itself be in violation

817
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:11,250
of international law the plea of

818
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:14,370
necessity is likewise not available to

819
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:16,860
the United States in this situation the

820
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,230
plea of necessity can be asserted to

821
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,350
take action against non-state actors and

822
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,560
it can justify actions that violate the

823
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:29,339
rights of non responsible States but

824
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,830
only if the threat if the threat to the

825
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:34,830
injured state is sufficiently grave and

826
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:39,279
imminent and there are no other means of

827
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:41,960
safeguarding that essential interest

828
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,420
state attribution is not a precondition

829
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,109
for taking action based on the plea of

830
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,359
necessity what constitutes the state's

831
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:53,500
essential interest is not clearly

832
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:55,700
defined but it would certainly include

833
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,579
the sort of things that were affected by

834
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,759
the Sam Sam attacks like healthcare

835
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:05,089
justice and policing however it is

836
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,339
unlikely that a temporary interruption

837
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:11,420
in the functionality of these systems in

838
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:14,390
just a few cities is sufficient to put

839
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,540
those central interests in grave and

840
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:21,400
imminent peril and it is also unlikely

841
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:26,180
that the US would have no other means to

842
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,710
safeguard those interests and finally in

843
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,960
any case the ransomware attacks have

844
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,000
stopped and the plea of necessity can

845
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:39,349
only be invoked to end the harmful

846
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,059
activity the third response possibly

847
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:42,410
available to the u.s. is taking an

848
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:46,030
action in self-defense

849
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:50,118
this is probably the least viable option

850
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:52,220
under article 51 of the UN Charter a

851
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,260
state may respond with force to a cyber

852
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:58,848
operation that qualifies as an armed

853
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,799
attack there's some dispute between

854
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,829
states as to what constitutes an armed

855
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:06,980
attack the majority view is that only

856
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:08,809
grave uses of force are that what the US

857
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,390
has consistently held that any use of

858
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:13,339
force is an armed attack since we are

859
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,308
talking about the United States that is

860
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:19,430
the view that is relevant but even under

861
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:21,710
that view the Sam Sam campaign can't be

862
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,328
considered a use of force and so the

863
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,000
u.s. may not respond with force in

864
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:29,480
self-defense

865
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,480
which brings us to the only viable

866
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,270
option which is Rhetor ssin Rhetor ssin

867
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,490
is lawful retaliation in kind for in

868
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:42,259
other countries unfriendly or unfair

869
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:43,848
action it is the best legal response

870
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,210
available to the United States in

871
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:50,299
dealing with the Sam Sam attacks acts of

872
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,339
return are lawful although unfriendly

873
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:55,130
for example a state

874
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:58,069
may respond by suspending diplomatic

875
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:00,009
relations restricting travel rights or

876
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,759
expelling foreign nationals or

877
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:05,390
preventing the use of it cyber

878
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:07,729
infrastructure for communications retour

879
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,259
ssin is the only way the US can really

880
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,269
respond to the Samsom ransomware

881
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,920
campaign without a determination that

882
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:16,718
another state has breached an

883
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,880
international obligation owed to the US

884
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,160
the samsam ransomware campaign disrupted

885
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,619
healthcare organizations and municipal

886
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,769
services in numerous locations across

887
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,019
the u.s. undoubtedly the actions were

888
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:32,508
malicious cyber operations carried out

889
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:36,379
by foreign actors implicating the rights

890
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:37,789
of the US under international law what

891
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,519
to be considered internationally

892
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,469
unlawful acts the ransomware campaign

893
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,288
would have to constitute a breach of an

894
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:47,029
international law obligation the attacks

895
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:50,210
were neither uses of force no core

896
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:52,579
coercive interventions and while

897
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:58,369
violations of US sovereignty the attacks

898
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:59,749
are not attributable to a state thus the

899
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,640
attacks do not qualify as

900
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:03,319
internationally unlawful acts and it

901
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,129
limits the possible recourse for the

902
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:09,019
u.s. as we have seen countermeasures the

903
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:12,259
plea of necessity and self-defense are

904
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,968
not suitable responses or torsion is the

905
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:17,869
only legal response available to the

906
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:20,299
u.s. it's not a particularly satisfying

907
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,190
outcome and demonstrates difficulty

908
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:26,319
faced by States in using international

909
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,319
law to respond to modern cyber attacks

910
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,489
thank you that is my presentation

911
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:41,470
[Applause]

912
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,130
thank you very much for the presentation

913
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:49,029
I actually have a question on one of the

914
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:51,280
topics so when you considered if the

915
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,410
incident was a prohibited intervention

916
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,450
you came to the conclusion that while it

917
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,960
did implicate the internal affairs of

918
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:00,730
the United States it was not coercive so

919
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,890
could you please elaborate a little bit

920
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,619
on that assuming that we can attribute

921
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:10,660
the incident if a state demands ransom

922
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:13,720
from another state like from from his

923
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:16,118
budget isn't that clearly coercive yes

924
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,879
well - to be considered a coercive

925
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,549
intervention you have to intervene in

926
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,500
the internal affairs a coercive manner

927
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:26,319
so what you're trying to compel the

928
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,660
state to do is to modify those internal

929
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,349
affairs what happened in this case is

930
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,660
the perpetrators sought money to be a

931
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:37,869
course of intervention in municipal

932
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,180
affairs or you know traffic affairs they

933
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,760
would have to be seeking to force those

934
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,919
cities to take particular policies

935
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,040
regarding traffic or healthcare not

936
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,040
simply seeking money thank you

937
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,029
questions from the audience

938
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:13,160
hello thanks a lot for the for the

939
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,329
presentation my name is Simon hood Mazar

940
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,819
from the International Committee of the

941
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:18,410
Red Cross I would have a question you

942
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:20,869
said you you did not mention due

943
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,549
diligence but to me a situation where we

944
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,059
have a non-state actor operating from

945
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:29,089
one state and no it's not attributable

946
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,589
to any state if we think about responses

947
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,599
and responsibilities I think due

948
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,130
diligence it's actually quite pertinent

949
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:38,539
and I would be interested to hear your

950
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:41,329
views especially that regard to what

951
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:43,249
means of what what responses are

952
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:46,160
available to the state if another state

953
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:50,930
is not willing to to halt these wrongful

954
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,729
acts by non-state actors Thanks yes I I

955
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,439
didn't thank you for the question I

956
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:56,839
didn't discuss due diligence because it

957
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:58,670
it's particularly complicated and I

958
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,078
didn't want to spend so much of the

959
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,609
presentation speaking about due

960
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:07,309
diligence but the problem here for me is

961
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:09,288
it it's not clear or when I was writing

962
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:12,109
the article it wasn't clear who

963
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:16,160
perpetrated these attacks so I had to

964
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:19,759
speculate a lot about what state the US

965
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,609
would have to ask to take actions to

966
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:23,900
stop these attacks I mean the the

967
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:27,019
obligation of due diligence is that if

968
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,839
you are aware or reasonably should be

969
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:33,439
aware that actions are emanating from

970
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:37,038
your state that implicate the rights of

971
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:39,410
another state you as the territorial

972
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,140
state have an obligation to end those

973
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:45,949
actions or to you know take reasonable

974
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,799
efforts to end those actions so it

975
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:50,209
wasn't clear to me whether and I

976
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:51,589
discussed this a bit in my article but

977
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:54,140
it wasn't clear whether the United

978
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:56,989
States had asked any other states to

979
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,328
take actions to stop those whether any

980
00:43:56,989 --> 00:44:01,519
territorial state I guess I ran in the

981
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:04,339
situation whether Iran had agreed to

982
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:07,008
take actions had taken actions and just

983
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:09,229
failed to stop them had refused to take

984
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:10,489
actions or you know there there's a lot

985
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:13,339
of possibilities of what could have

986
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:15,549
taken place and none of it is publicly

987
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,549
available

988
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,069
yes one more question

989
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,580
hi thank you Raquel Garber's Department

990
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,960
of National Defense Canada I'd actually

991
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,950
like to ask the first presenter a

992
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,950
comment about the second presenters

993
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:37,779
argument when the second presenter sort

994
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,140
of worked through the possible responses

995
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,240
right you can see that they are all

996
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,490
designed to make an action a sort of

997
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,430
discrete action finish

998
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:51,069
it's retaliation in kind so it's all

999
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:54,069
very circumscribed and extremely

1000
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:57,730
limiting from a deterrence perspective

1001
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:01,210
so given that construct in that example

1002
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:03,460
how would you reconcile that with your

1003
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:06,280
position that they're significantly way

1004
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,980
for states to take action yes so I think

1005
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,849
that that's a really good point and I

1006
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,740
think that it really depends on what the

1007
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:16,150
what you're trying to what you're going

1008
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,689
after and what you're trying to respond

1009
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:21,880
to so this is a fairly discrete incident

1010
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,240
what I'm looking at or the continuous

1011
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:29,160
campaigns I would say one would be

1012
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:33,609
Russia with election interference

1013
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,589
perhaps China's attacks on US companies

1014
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,940
and their intellectual property that

1015
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,830
would be something more that is

1016
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,970
something that we see continuously I

1017
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:45,369
think this the Atlanta incident this was

1018
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:49,209
something where I I would say was more

1019
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:57,180
episodic which I I think we we just got

1020
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:57,180
yep yeah sure

1021
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,660
mmm

1022
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,850
yeah

1023
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,770
okay

1024
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,080
yeah so I mean I think that I I think

1025
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,450
you're exactly right that once there

1026
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,920
once there is a pattern and if we I mean

1027
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,569
part part if it does get to the

1028
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,210
attribution and see what source it's

1029
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,190
coming from so just the fact that we've

1030
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,780
had a few ransomware incidents that I

1031
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,410
don't think would necessarily be a

1032
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,820
pattern that would allow this continuous

1033
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,009
response so I mean a lot of it really

1034
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,320
does depend on the intelligence that

1035
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,300
we're gathering about where this is

1036
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,090
coming from and whether it is episodic

1037
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,010
whether it is a continuing pattern and

1038
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,590
whether it's ceased so I mean I think it

1039
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:03,180
really does require an evaluation of the

1040
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:05,400
circumstances so I think it's time for

1041
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,549
the third presentation one of the main

1042
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,500
postulates of Talon 2.0 20 manual 2.0 is

1043
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,120
that each state has territorial

1044
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,340
sovereignty and exercises jurisdiction

1045
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,080
over the cyber infrastructure in its

1046
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,090
territory

1047
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,490
so it's both in its interest and it's

1048
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,680
its right to prevent adversary

1049
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,830
activities in its territory and the

1050
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,569
advent of 5g networks will lead to an

1051
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,940
even higher risk of these adversary

1052
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:33,210
activities so Qadri is the lead author

1053
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,760
of a recent Eliseo a paper on 5g yes

1054
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:39,630
best suited to talk about the issues

1055
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,070
raised by this technology thank you very

1056
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,800
much too much for them for the

1057
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:46,140
introduction and very good afternoon

1058
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,000
from my site as well to all of you well

1059
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,509
actually when when Thomas approached me

1060
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,660
with with a proposal to discuss on the

1061
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:59,310
Steichen stage the how international law

1062
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:02,190
is operating in action in in dealing

1063
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,140
with a mundane realities of real life I

1064
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,960
I found the idea of rather intriguing

1065
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,210
but I must must also admit that whatever

1066
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:13,230
title be conjured up we are definitely

1067
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:17,100
not striving to conceptualize sort of

1068
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:19,890
new thought for supply security it's

1069
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:23,220
rather really what I would like to do is

1070
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:27,359
contextualize international law in

1071
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:34,600
action against the particular case which

1072
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:37,990
was which is the the looming or

1073
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:42,520
or awaited deployment of white jade

1074
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:50,040
networks and which sense not an incident

1075
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:53,410
not an existing or or happened operation

1076
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:56,730
but but a risk arising of a potential

1077
00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:01,029
reliance of a supplier in awareness of

1078
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:04,360
the context of that supplier coming from

1079
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:09,550
an autocratic system of an adversarial

1080
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:12,460
state so so I would first I have this

1081
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:15,580
little thing here what I would first do

1082
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:19,270
is give you an sort of an overview of

1083
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:21,490
that of that mundane reality so the 5g

1084
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,040
study that we published this year

1085
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:26,279
together with our esteemed moderator and

1086
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,680
another colleague of the CCD Seri and

1087
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:33,120
which was called Hawaii 5g and China is

1088
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,680
the secure as a security threat and then

1089
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:38,650
by means of introduction really rather

1090
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,839
than than an in-depth analysis which I

1091
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,530
think considered the the previous

1092
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,300
speaker provided a very good example of

1093
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,150
taking an actual case and putting it

1094
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:53,500
through the the various legal tests but

1095
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:57,910
I will merely refer to the international

1096
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:02,920
law of frameworks we analyzed and found

1097
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:06,339
applicable and then then discussed our

1098
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,400
sort of broader reflections on the on

1099
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:13,800
the role of and on the expectation of

1100
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:17,200
the on the legal expertise legal experts

1101
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:21,280
especially when it comes to the

1102
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:25,240
realities that are faced by the by the

1103
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,710
legal legal community are not just a

1104
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,870
legal community in small states and

1105
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:34,170
that's let's face it small states make

1106
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:38,580
up about 2/3 of both NATO allies and and

1107
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,580
EU Member States in our context

1108
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:50,470
so so what's the what's the West's issue

1109
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:53,140
with 5g and away exactly a we've heard

1110
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,140
that throughout the course of this the

1111
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,720
drafting process we heard the question

1112
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,940
odd nauseam really what is wiser away an

1113
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,890
issue if there is no a smoking gun

1114
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:09,160
and so and also by means of sort of

1115
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:11,290
scoping we did discuss really that or

1116
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,540
analyze the 5g issue alone we didn't

1117
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:16,660
venture ancient and and the current

1118
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:20,170
debates in regarding the u.s. executive

1119
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,640
order around who always brought a

1120
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,770
product range where we're not in our

1121
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:28,150
scope so I would not touch upon that but

1122
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:32,050
we looked at the Hawaii as 5g supplier

1123
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:36,490
from three angles so first the role of

1124
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:38,680
5g in our or expected or envisioned role

1125
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:41,169
of 5g in our increasingly digitally

1126
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:45,549
dependent societies especially looking

1127
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:49,390
into the future and and the role 5g is

1128
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:52,840
expected to have admitting that no one

1129
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:54,310
can quite imagine the what the ecosystem

1130
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,400
of new products and services and

1131
00:51:54,310 --> 00:52:00,359
processes will look like and lead to

1132
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,220
then secondly we looked at always

1133
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,440
current contested position in the market

1134
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:08,740
and the factors that have brought it

1135
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:15,600
there as well as its its track record of

1136
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:20,950
date to date of the engagement in in

1137
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:23,589
cyber espionage or or or economic

1138
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,660
espionage and then finally we looked at

1139
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:31,420
China's legal and political environment

1140
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:35,980
its economic pattern of economic cyber

1141
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:42,369
espionage and with acknowledging that

1142
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:44,890
economic capacity has for a for a while

1143
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:47,470
really being or for a long time being

1144
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:50,080
Chinese preferred means of or to

1145
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,500
achieving and exerting geopolitical

1146
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,500
influence

1147
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:03,820
so so why why 5g why the attention

1148
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:06,849
especially for the for the legal and

1149
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,099
policy community 5g is a sort of for

1150
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:11,170
many of us the 5g term is something

1151
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:13,480
floating in the air perceived as

1152
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:17,849
something that that will at some point

1153
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:20,079
bring us better data speeds but it's

1154
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:26,260
it's one thing is very clear it's not

1155
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:28,420
just better for 4G I wish we had time

1156
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:31,240
for the for the nice video we

1157
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:35,980
represented at the at the report launch

1158
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:38,200
but but there's plenty plenty of good

1159
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:43,420
material to illustrate the sort of the

1160
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,700
diversity and and the capacity of the

1161
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,440
potential five 5g solutions I do you

1162
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,598
recommend to to look them up if you're

1163
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:54,310
interested in getting a better glimpse

1164
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:57,880
of of the looming future we are we are

1165
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:59,349
talking about when we talk about what G

1166
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,089
we are we are talking about the

1167
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:06,130
qualitative jump so lower latency better

1168
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:08,170
meaning better connection times there

1169
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:11,589
possibility to simultaneously connected

1170
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:14,670
more devices and more versatile

1171
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:17,319
versatile devices products solutions

1172
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:20,710
from all domains of human life media

1173
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:24,880
medical transportation education

1174
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:27,849
government functions whatnot so it's not

1175
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,010
an exaggeration to consider 5g as their

1176
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:32,619
really that the digital nervous system

1177
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:37,540
of our increasingly digital societies

1178
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:39,099
and and from a cyber security point of

1179
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:44,310
view we can we can be pretty much

1180
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:47,530
assured that that they all or in the the

1181
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:50,230
ecosystem in a sense will not go undergo

1182
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:54,630
a fundamental change meaning that

1183
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:58,329
anything that can be abused or used can

1184
00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:01,589
can also be abused

1185
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:03,060
meaning that all those cool gadgets and

1186
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,779
processes and

1187
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,970
and services will be both targets and

1188
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:16,160
potentially also means a cyber attack

1189
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:19,500
cyber operations so due to such

1190
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,040
integrated role of 5g networks in the in

1191
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,840
the society as an enabler and for for

1192
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:29,370
societal and economic and governance

1193
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:30,810
functions it will be and communications

1194
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:33,509
infrastructure essential for the

1195
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:37,470
functioning of our contemporary

1196
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:39,960
societies and it will bear dependencies

1197
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:42,390
and dependence risks for for not just

1198
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,420
the communication sectors sector but all

1199
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:48,150
all other interconnected and an interval

1200
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:51,990
ient sectors including those

1201
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:57,390
cross-border so and of course once

1202
00:55:51,990 --> 00:56:01,500
installed and deployed or once you opt

1203
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:04,410
for a certain technology the decision to

1204
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:08,340
simply revert or switch to another

1205
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:11,339
provider and another type of solution

1206
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,320
may not be may not be something that is

1207
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:17,360
easily done the cost may be prohibitive

1208
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:19,800
it may require it will probably require

1209
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,140
changing architecture and and other

1210
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,080
complications like that so so the choice

1211
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:28,859
is really considering the the

1212
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:30,720
significance of of the new generation of

1213
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,140
communications networks forever for the

1214
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:37,169
society the it it can't really be viewed

1215
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:40,740
as a as a Mallee technocratic step for a

1216
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:43,290
decision the the the risk assessment and

1217
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,779
the risk of understanding has to be has

1218
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,180
to be done earlier before before the

1219
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,650
critical decisions are taken so Y

1220
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:55,830
hallway the company has over the recent

1221
00:56:52,650 --> 00:57:00,320
years grown into the the largest

1222
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:03,330
telecoms provider or telecoms

1223
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,130
equipment manufacturer globally it is

1224
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:08,790
currently the only company that can

1225
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:12,630
provide all the elements of a 5g network

1226
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:15,320
at at cost and scale meaning the closest

1227
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:18,890
competitors can can provide

1228
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,230
so segment sorghum can provide elements

1229
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:25,069
of 5g networks but not the entire range

1230
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:28,970
and and it has very clearly stated its

1231
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:32,750
ambition to acquire market dominance in

1232
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:38,180
in provision of 5g services and and

1233
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:43,120
equipment and and her way and other

1234
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:46,069
Chinese telecoms companies also have

1235
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:49,130
gained rather significant role it's also

1236
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:53,720
in 5g standards development so in when

1237
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:57,350
in for 2 and 3G communications networks

1238
00:57:53,720 --> 00:58:01,270
their role was was more marginal if you

1239
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:04,490
in that it is grown with with 4G and

1240
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:06,500
with no without 5g standards and

1241
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:10,069
intellectual property rights they they

1242
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:12,860
hold Chinese companies hold about one

1243
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:15,020
one tenth of all the all the critical or

1244
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:18,980
core standards and then Hawaii has their

1245
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:22,460
largest proportion of it and then so why

1246
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:23,420
the fuss the main claim as I as I

1247
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,760
mentioned in the beginning of the

1248
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,560
skeptics has been that today there have

1249
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,950
been no significant exploitable

1250
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:37,160
vulnerabilities in Hawaii in any of her

1251
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:38,930
waste products and that means that no we

1252
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,310
cannot really talk about an incident or

1253
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:47,029
we cannot talk about an on an operation

1254
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,980
that has been identified and it is

1255
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:52,310
important that we distinguish between an

1256
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:54,820
actual breach and evidence of an actual

1257
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:57,650
breach and the risk of a bridge shortly

1258
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,600
exploitation so we are not talking about

1259
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:01,520
responding and the option options to

1260
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,569
respond to an actual incident we are

1261
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,950
talking about risk assessment and

1262
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:10,820
feasible risk assessment measures to

1263
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:12,589
which the legal frameworks that they set

1264
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,620
their limits and to which the legal

1265
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:18,250
advice has to be so there has to be

1266
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:22,730
aware of and and has to has to recognize

1267
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:25,850
so what we do know that is that who

1268
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,950
always track record in terms of cyber

1269
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,450
and economic

1270
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:32,359
you know it's not exactly blameless

1271
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:35,779
there's quite a few or a few court cases

1272
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:38,690
in the u.s. there there's ongoing or or

1273
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,329
court convictions also in in earlier

1274
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:44,829
years there currently

1275
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:50,329
Canada Poland have detained hallways

1276
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:53,480
employees a leach for alleged cyber

1277
00:59:50,329 --> 01:00:02,570
espionage and and breaching sanctions

1278
00:59:53,480 --> 01:00:04,730
regime so so it's in a sense way we have

1279
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:07,670
seen that we have the scene we see the

1280
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,740
pattern of operation we know that

1281
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,109
capacity and the the ambition and that

1282
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:16,040
sort of even for the legal adviser has

1283
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:17,660
to work or lag somewhere in the in the

1284
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,000
back of their mind when they when they

1285
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:23,299
also considering this issue from from

1286
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,310
risk basis and then of course we have

1287
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,760
their recent in terms of product

1288
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:34,869
security we have the recent report of

1289
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:40,760
the UK cybersecurity evaluation center

1290
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:42,710
which stated that they they have found

1291
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,220
significant and technical deficiencies

1292
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:48,560
in some of our waste products and they

1293
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:56,000
or even the the sort of production chain

1294
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:58,190
and they cannot offer concrete or they

1295
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,790
can only provide limited limited

1296
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:04,970
assurance that the risks to UK national

1297
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:07,130
security from who is involvement in in

1298
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:10,959
UK's critical networks can be

1299
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,960
sufficiently mitigated in the long term

1300
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:19,040
and then we have the we have the second

1301
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,040
security environment we know that

1302
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,300
economy is China's preferred approach to

1303
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,509
exerting strategic influence globally we

1304
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,820
know that the country has pursued

1305
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:35,180
persistently a technological superiority

1306
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:38,240
or self-sufficiency agenda whether about

1307
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:42,919
the past decade investing heavily into

1308
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:46,790
its tech secretary it's R&D subsidizing

1309
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,760
that technology sector and the

1310
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:52,190
communications sector in or in

1311
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,099
particular within that and we know of

1312
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:58,220
existing market barriers to foreign

1313
01:01:55,099 --> 01:02:01,460
providers which give the local local

1314
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:03,290
economy and local suppliers clearly

1315
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:06,200
unbeatable economies of scale

1316
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:08,359
considering the scope of the Chinese

1317
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:12,230
market and then there is the legal and

1318
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:15,069
political environment there is the the

1319
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:19,300
Chinese national intelligence law of

1320
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:21,760
2016 which requires all companies to

1321
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,630
support and provide assistance to

1322
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:28,990
incorporate the national intelligence

1323
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:31,609
work and got the secrecy of any any such

1324
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:34,399
intelligence work that they are aware of

1325
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:35,810
and then the promise and the legal

1326
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,550
guarantee from the state that the state

1327
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:41,150
shall protect individuals and

1328
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:44,510
organizations that support and cooperate

1329
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:46,130
with and collaborate within or in

1330
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,040
national national intelligence work and

1331
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:51,250
the similar provision exists in in

1332
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:54,740
National counterintelligence law which

1333
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:57,619
requires all domestic companies and

1334
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:01,009
individuals and and entities to provide

1335
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:09,710
information and facilities and other

1336
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:11,000
assistance to the to the state in for

1337
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:18,280
for the purposes of counterintelligence

1338
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:24,600
and and mandates or prohibits those

1339
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:27,130
the entities of refusing cooperation so

1340
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,740
taken together the these acts don't

1341
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:32,980
really leave much assurance regarding

1342
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:34,600
judicial or public oversight to

1343
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:40,000
constrain the interaction introduction

1344
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:41,890
about the backdoors into into the 5g

1345
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,460
solutions shoot the state deemed is

1346
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:47,140
necessary for a for the broad notion of

1347
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,870
maintaining state security and of course

1348
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:53,049
given the that given the political

1349
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:55,470
contexts where such requests are

1350
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:59,320
normally complied with rather than

1351
01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:00,939
contested and I I've grown up in an

1352
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,740
autocratic regime so I know that the

1353
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,750
civil disobedience is not really

1354
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:07,839
something you come to play into heavily

1355
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:11,320
in a system like that so the companies

1356
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:16,500
are normally not inclined to or or to

1357
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,500
not comply with such requests

1358
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:25,749
so where does it leave us in terms of

1359
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:31,689
international law to pull the pyramid

1360
01:04:25,749 --> 01:04:34,589
together the primary risk of of using

1361
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:38,408
Chinese 5g technology comes from the

1362
01:04:34,589 --> 01:04:41,469
influence exerted of a Chinese companies

1363
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:45,189
by their government and military and the

1364
01:04:41,469 --> 01:04:47,799
the criticality that 5g is expected to

1365
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:51,189
have do they do the functioning of our

1366
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:56,049
of our sort of social society or

1367
01:04:51,189 --> 01:04:58,629
societal and economic system so we know

1368
01:04:56,049 --> 01:05:00,369
that the capacity is there to conduct

1369
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,779
cyber operations the conducive

1370
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:06,819
environment is there we know the track

1371
01:05:01,779 --> 01:05:12,789
record and but we still like The Smoking

1372
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:16,329
Gun so one could ask what the surance is

1373
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:19,089
the international law and treaty regimes

1374
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:24,669
offered to constrain China's potentially

1375
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:27,849
malicious of behavior and we the

1376
01:05:24,669 --> 01:05:30,459
previous speaker again outlined the

1377
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:33,729
examples and sort of the walkthroughs

1378
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:36,308
pretty pretty systematically and clearly

1379
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:38,649
for all of us so the honest answer is

1380
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:39,249
when it comes to dealing with risks not

1381
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:41,049
much

1382
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:43,089
we know that acts of espionage are

1383
01:05:41,049 --> 01:05:44,739
normally publishable punishable under

1384
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:47,049
domestic law we know that the

1385
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:48,819
international law public international

1386
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:51,759
law doesn't really address those issues

1387
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:56,579
much unless the particular operation or

1388
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:59,289
the particular activities breach or

1389
01:05:56,579 --> 01:06:03,999
certain thresholds of constitute

1390
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:07,179
malicious or prohibited a breach of

1391
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:11,288
international obligations per se oh all

1392
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:15,899
of those require a certain sort of

1393
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:20,259
coming over a certain certain threshold

1394
01:06:15,899 --> 01:06:22,449
require tangible effect and require

1395
01:06:20,259 --> 01:06:24,189
clear state involvement so to the stage

1396
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:28,000
where we are still talking only about a

1397
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:35,089
risk rather than an actual

1398
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:37,250
incident we we have a toolbox but we

1399
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:39,320
really need for sort of the risk to

1400
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:41,839
materialize before we can start drawing

1401
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:45,880
upon that that toolbox to respond and

1402
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:50,380
for most countries or if not all of them

1403
01:06:45,880 --> 01:07:01,070
this is not really where we want to go

1404
01:06:50,380 --> 01:07:03,440
so and I will hop over this but the I

1405
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:06,500
think given the slides will be available

1406
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,839
later sort of the outline of the

1407
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:15,500
division of the National responses it's

1408
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:17,839
there so so where does it where does it

1409
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:20,839
leave us as the legal community and the

1410
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:25,940
National legal advisors in terms of

1411
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:29,029
being able to offer credible legal tools

1412
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:31,940
and legal advice to our other

1413
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:35,000
governments especially where we are

1414
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,849
facing a situation where we where we are

1415
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,300
becoming increasingly aware of the risk

1416
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:42,680
but and we know that the risk mechanism

1417
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,050
must be supported by national law but

1418
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:48,890
what the international mechanisms don't

1419
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:50,119
really support as much somebody has

1420
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,670
wisely said that if they're looking for

1421
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:54,740
the smoking gun and if you're ready if

1422
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,150
you can actually see the smoking gun it

1423
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:06,649
means that we probably already been hit

1424
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:09,319
oh very very likely so so we sort of

1425
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:13,520
summarizing we really need especially as

1426
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:17,509
a coming from a small state again we

1427
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:19,160
cannot really afford this division of

1428
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:21,049
competence where our legal experts from

1429
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,630
the one hand are well trained in

1430
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:26,269
international law and our policy and our

1431
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:28,790
technical and a national cybersecurity

1432
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:32,690
strategy is driving us in a direction

1433
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:37,439
where we are aiming to invest more into

1434
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:40,198
resilience and and preventing and

1435
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:43,229
and improving our defenses so we the

1436
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:47,729
legal community has to offer strat

1437
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:50,939
strategy and policy makers with credible

1438
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:54,948
options and I've especially from sort of

1439
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:59,388
my my a bit of a blended role of a legal

1440
01:08:54,948 --> 01:09:02,370
researcher at the CCDC OE and having

1441
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:05,219
fairly recently for the Estonian

1442
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:07,290
National Cyber Security Agency we see

1443
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:09,589
that we are as the legal community we

1444
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:13,139
are often providing tools that are

1445
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:16,318
intellectually stimulating but that the

1446
01:09:13,139 --> 01:09:20,359
practitioners and and the national sort

1447
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:23,969
of cybersecurity strategy really cannot

1448
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:25,589
cannot draw upon and again the small

1449
01:09:23,969 --> 01:09:27,630
state reality is that you probably

1450
01:09:25,589 --> 01:09:30,809
cannot function in a setup where where

1451
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:33,420
you have the piece of expertise piece of

1452
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:37,350
detail specific expertise in in one

1453
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:40,040
house and in international law and then

1454
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:44,960
maybe on on international trade law or

1455
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:49,198
the network and the information security

1456
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:51,689
directive in another house and an

1457
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:53,908
intellectual property or also take this

1458
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:56,129
take the protection law in a fourth

1459
01:09:53,908 --> 01:10:00,690
house and and hoping that these will

1460
01:09:56,130 --> 01:10:05,880
this will in a sense combined provide

1461
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:08,629
meaningful and working answers to the to

1462
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,870
the national resilience building efforts

1463
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:14,159
so so I'm I would really advocate for

1464
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:16,730
rather than viewing this as a

1465
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,080
comprehensive issue meaning the sum of

1466
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:21,299
individual elements we really need to

1467
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,460
become better in terms of integrating

1468
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:28,010
the legal expertise but also integrating

1469
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:30,780
in in how lawyers are able to advise

1470
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:32,250
strategy strategic level of a nation and

1471
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,759
the policymakers as well as the

1472
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:37,469
technical community so the sort of the

1473
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,420
the integrated learning process where

1474
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:43,040
lawyers become better digitally literate

1475
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:45,960
and and the technical community

1476
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:49,620
understands the basics of the law is

1477
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:52,230
is something that that bears a more more

1478
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:54,179
practical significance for in our our

1479
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:57,360
work as then as the center of excellence

1480
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:59,250
as well so sorry for for keeping your

1481
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,440
attention for for so long and taking

1482
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:04,800
away for sort of snatching your chance

1483
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,809
to your time to ask questions but

1484
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,300
hopefully we'll have time to discuss in

1485
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:17,520
there in the following session thank so

1486
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:20,790
much so I will actually follow up on

1487
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,429
your main conclusion and us the main

1488
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:27,510
editor of the recent center's paper on

1489
01:11:23,429 --> 01:11:29,670
trends in international law are also

1490
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:35,010
best suited to answer my question about

1491
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:38,060
the future so do you see like a common

1492
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:40,050
approach or common policy crystallizing

1493
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:43,170
internationally among among various

1494
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:45,929
states or is it more of a situation of

1495
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:49,620
fragmentation when you for example look

1496
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:54,630
at the EU negotiations or EU new

1497
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:59,120
developments in this regard I would like

1498
01:11:54,630 --> 01:12:01,199
to know your opinion about about fossil

1499
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,440
developments also with regard to

1500
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:06,780
international law based on this I think

1501
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,919
I'm still stealing a Christian and

1502
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,620
twisting the angle of it

1503
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:14,460
what I what I think I see is a capacity

1504
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:19,440
gap we have we have the example of the

1505
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:25,830
US and and large European allies that

1506
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:28,980
are investing heavily in also upgrading

1507
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:31,769
and then pushing forward pulling forward

1508
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:35,759
a international or discussion by by

1509
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:37,980
state practice and then we have we have

1510
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,590
an the majority of the countries in the

1511
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,718
world well who who will never rate the

1512
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:45,239
price to that scale also in terms of

1513
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,100
expertise being very reliant on the on

1514
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:49,230
the bigger allies which is a strength of

1515
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:54,020
that NATO alliance on on the one hand

1516
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:56,699
but it also means that the realities and

1517
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:58,710
sort of the playground is defined by a

1518
01:12:56,699 --> 01:13:03,290
by larger actors and

1519
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:05,880
smaller states have have difficulty

1520
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:10,710
meaningfully and responsibly operating

1521
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:12,630
operating in that so I'm not sure it by

1522
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,540
far our answers your question but this

1523
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:18,090
is this is the sort of the concern that

1524
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:23,090
I've had watching this discussion the

1525
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:24,690
discussion roll out thank you so

1526
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:28,670
questions from the audience

1527
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:30,719
Oh gotcha thank you

1528
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,670
Thank You Kathy for your really

1529
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,100
thought-provoking a very interesting

1530
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:37,469
presentation and it's so my name is

1531
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,810
Kumar Chuck University of Exeter and

1532
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:41,880
it's really nice that we have both or

1533
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:44,489
two of the authors of the three authors

1534
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,590
so Thomas feel free to chip in as well

1535
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:49,349
for me one of the very interesting

1536
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:51,179
conclusions of your report was that

1537
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:53,610
Western states and I think I quote

1538
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:56,340
almost exactly that western states are

1539
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:59,339
in principle free to ban Chinese

1540
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:04,140
products including the products by

1541
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:05,699
Huawei and so I just wanted to see if

1542
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,230
you could tease out a little bit more

1543
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:10,469
the implications of this and the

1544
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:12,540
analysis of this conclusion from the

1545
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:14,250
perspective of international law I think

1546
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:16,409
in the report you say that this would be

1547
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,270
subject to the relevant international

1548
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:21,540
trade law exceptions and then you

1549
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:23,580
suggest that it's the essential security

1550
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,989
interest exemption that would apply but

1551
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,969
I would put it to you that that

1552
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:29,309
exception under international law is

1553
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:32,070
very very restrictive and you would be

1554
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:33,780
able to identify basically that this

1555
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:35,730
would relate to measures taken in

1556
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:38,429
situation of an international emergency

1557
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:41,190
and so I was just wondering how you were

1558
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:43,380
thinking about this particular issue if

1559
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:45,719
it would come to that that some states

1560
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:48,060
would decide to take up your conclusion

1561
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:49,620
on this particular legal matter how

1562
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,030
would they justify it under the

1563
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,170
applicable international trade law

1564
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:54,170
framework thank you

1565
01:14:55,710 --> 01:15:03,219
so they take it well you can you can

1566
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,960
possibly probably suspect that we didn't

1567
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:08,739
have an international trade lawyer also

1568
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,940
the limitations of small states in in in

1569
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:15,669
the drafting group of the report what we

1570
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:19,960
what we the conclusion we reached was

1571
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:22,330
that in broad terms the by means of

1572
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,600
exercising sovereignty states are also

1573
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:28,780
free to choose the essentially the

1574
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,060
critical how they lay out or whom they

1575
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:32,800
accept in the market is critical for for

1576
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,900
the purpose of critical components of

1577
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:39,070
their fundamental infrastructure and

1578
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:42,489
then subject to alter at lateral and

1579
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:47,530
bilateral trade agreements which of

1580
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:51,280
course sort of do put or to uphold the

1581
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:53,170
national security clause pretty in

1582
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,410
pretty straightforward terms the

1583
01:15:53,170 --> 01:16:01,110
particular provision of the cat that we

1584
01:15:56,410 --> 01:16:06,820
referred to it was according to our

1585
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:10,349
findings deliberately phrased in a broad

1586
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:15,610
and inclusive manner so were so only

1587
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:19,090
blatant examples of sort of misuse of

1588
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:20,710
that provision would would fall outside

1589
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:22,030
of its scope so everything that promote

1590
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:26,040
Lee looks like a national security

1591
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:29,050
interest can pretty plausibly be

1592
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,300
considered or sort of taken into into

1593
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:34,360
that exception but of course this is

1594
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,760
where we this is pretty much where our

1595
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,710
insight stopped because we we were

1596
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,410
really preaching the the surface win

1597
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:44,260
there in that discussion and then didn't

1598
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:48,210
explore much further especially as the

1599
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:50,410
sort of what I appreciate about the or

1600
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:53,780
appreciate about the European approach

1601
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:56,849
is that they there is more

1602
01:16:53,780 --> 01:17:01,920
the emerging consensus seems to give

1603
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:04,050
more room for false Odin conscious risk

1604
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:08,040
management allowing to take those

1605
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:10,860
different economic and social interests

1606
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:13,310
engine into account next to the security

1607
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,309
interests

1608
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:24,910
any more questions calling some and

1609
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:26,200
me to feel that I could call on some

1610
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:30,730
Midshipmen if you want

1611
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,730
[Laughter]

1612
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,460
drink yes

1613
01:17:41,929 --> 01:17:51,429
sure yeah of course yeah no it's not you

1614
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:56,270
once again so coming back to the Samsung

1615
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:57,830
example and that the link that has been

1616
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,989
proposed between your persistent

1617
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,940
engagement and and and Sam Sam so let's

1618
01:17:59,989 --> 01:18:05,530
let's do a hypothetical that's it's

1619
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:07,460
hypothesize that the US would have

1620
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:10,099
established which command and control

1621
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:13,280
server is responsible for spreading this

1622
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:15,890
Samsung malware would it be covered

1623
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,199
under persistent engagement if the US

1624
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:21,500
for the u.s. to go in and turn that

1625
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:24,230
server off if it was in red space let's

1626
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:26,810
say in Iran or gray space somewhere in

1627
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:29,989
Zimbabwe let's say and if he is what

1628
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,880
would be the legal justification on

1629
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:33,019
international law for for doing that

1630
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:39,500
thank you

1631
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:40,550
I mean I I think obviously would be very

1632
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,040
fact-specific

1633
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:45,050
and it would look at issues such as what

1634
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,400
other harms were being caused and so

1635
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:53,449
forth and is it continuing to be used

1636
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:55,190
because again the the want one of the

1637
01:18:53,449 --> 01:18:56,750
limitations is to have them cease the

1638
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,400
unlawful action so I think there are a

1639
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:01,909
lot of very specifics I think it could

1640
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,650
be as as a countermeasure but again I

1641
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:05,449
mean I think you're moving toward a

1642
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:09,080
justification for that but I think we

1643
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:11,949
would need a lot more fat than that yeah

1644
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,949
I would agree with
