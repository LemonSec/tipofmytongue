the Tallinn University of Technology and

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,700
a former legal researcher at the NATO

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,620
CCDC OE where she did research on

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,410
national cyber security strategies

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,640
international organizations

international criminal cooperation and

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,789
law so please take it away thank you so

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,760
much too much for the kind introduction

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:02,730
and good morning to everyone and welcome

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,408
to the most exciting panel of saikhan to

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,780
get there you know to get the spirit

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,310
right I'm very excited to be here

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,530
moderating this panel with the

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,540
distinguished speakers I've been

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,360
involved with saikhan for almost 10

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,759
years always affiliated to NATO city CoA

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,009
so this is my first year to be here on

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,130
stage without the affiliation a bit

32
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,409
nostalgic but also very exciting and I'm

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,479
very happy to be moderating exactly this

34
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,670
panel because I think the topic of

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,770
sovereignity and cyber operations is one

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,409
of the most compelling issues and not

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,560
only for lawyers but also for strategy

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,200
and policy people alike and we have

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,090
three very good speakers on stage we

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,079
will follow so that we start with

41
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,600
Professor Mike Schmidt then go on to

42
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,529
Perry sander dr. Barry sander and then

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,460
we will finish up with dr. Jim shimmy

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,040
suave robust key and we start with with

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,960
Mike and so I think he really doesn't

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,270
need any introduction but for those of

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,919
you who don't know him then he's like

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,000
the supernova of the galaxy or

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,420
international lawyers or something like

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,150
this

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:17,109
I hope supernova does him justice

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,440
and he is working for the University of

53
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,200
Exeter and the US Naval War College but

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,090
most of you perhaps know him as the

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,510
managing director or the general

56
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,720
director for the Tallinn manuals and he

57
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,970
will share with us the classic approach

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,030
to sovereignity and we will get to this

59
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,370
the less classic interpretations during

60
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,260
his presentation and also later later

61
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,750
during the question so thank you Mike

62
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,030
for being here once again and please

63
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,890
the stage is ours so it's certainly

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,109
great to be back here you know you've

65
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,760
been coming too long I flew in from

66
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:54,190
Israel last night I've been on the road

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,500
for five weeks and they gave me my card

68
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,409
and I just checked her card says guard

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,519
time and probably has says a university

70
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,349
and they're cadets from West Point

71
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,129
probably says United States Military

72
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,250
Academy they gave me a card that says

73
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,069
1956

74
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,890
my birthday I think I've been coming too

75
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,260
long at any rate so we're going to talk

76
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,649
about sovereignty in cyberspace this is

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,679
the number one topic in the field right

78
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,750
now in terms of state action I've just

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,250
been down with the OAS and then I went

80
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,950
from there to the ASEAN States

81
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,379
Association of Southeast Asia and this

82
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,018
is the topic that everyone is struggling

83
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,239
with and I'll be I'll explain why in

84
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,299
just a moment what I'd like to do is

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,829
start by spike by referencing what every

86
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,739
international lawyer who writes an

87
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:43,750
article on this issue talks about every

88
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,910
single article on this issue contains

89
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,349
this statement it is from the island of

90
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,019
Palmas and it's very clear

91
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,518
it explains sovereignty sovereignty is

92
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,069
the right of a state to do on its

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,129
territory what it wishes to do to the

94
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,470
exclusion of other states to the

95
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:03,879
exclusion of other states and that's the

96
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:06,879
critical issue now States do not seem to

97
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,548
have have felt that this does not apply

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,530
in cyberspace it was the general

99
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,169
consensus of all the states I've talked

100
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,539
to since I've been working in this field

101
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,940
that in cyberspace

102
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:22,330
there is sovereignty and indeed this is

103
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,930
what the UN gge said in their 2013

104
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,580
report and in their very important 2015

105
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,310
we

106
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,190
so over and over again we see States

107
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,770
concurring that sovereignty applies in

108
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,650
cyberspace so what I'll do in the

109
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,229
beginning is talk about how sovereignty

110
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,900
applies in cyberspace and then I'll

111
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,280
spend a little time talking about the

112
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,000
debate and giving you my personal

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,400
position on the issue

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,730
first of all sovereignty is a rule of

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,489
law that applies only to States now it

116
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,160
may apply to actions of non-state actors

117
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,770
like terrorists or activists when those

118
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,860
actions are attributable to States as a

119
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,289
matter of law that typically occurs when

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,110
those non-state actors those groups are

121
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,380
acting under the instructions direction

122
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,930
or control of a state there is one state

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,540
which has taken this even further and

124
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,790
argues that even if you cannot attribute

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,790
the actions of the non-state actor a

126
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,370
terrorist group in this case to a state

127
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,510
nevertheless cyber operations conducted

128
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,030
by that non-state group may in some

129
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,909
circumstances violate sovereignty that's

130
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,640
pretty clear in terms of sovereignty

131
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,160
there are two ways you may violate the

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,039
rule of sovereignty the first is pretty

133
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,890
simple sovereignty is about territory we

134
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:50,790
are on sovereign Estonian territory it

135
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:53,610
is crystal clear that Estonia controls

136
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:57,300
access to this territory that its

137
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,460
borders are inviolable however in the

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,970
cyber context the question we must ask

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,549
ourself is yeah but what about a remote

140
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,760
cyber operation a cyber operation from

141
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,419
outside Estonia that comes in to Estonia

142
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,690
and has effects that manifests in

143
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:18,180
Estonia in the tall and Manuel group we

144
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,060
said that there is no doubt whatsoever

145
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,700
not a scintilla of doubt that if a

146
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,000
remote cyber operation causes physical

147
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,820
effects or injury in this country that's

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,830
a violation of this country sovereignty

149
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,740
so long as those actions are

150
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,219
attributable to a state we went a step

151
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,360
further and said even when you don't

152
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,840
have physic

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,300
called damage if you have functional

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,310
damage then that's a violation of

155
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,120
sovereignty too in other words the cyber

156
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,699
infrastructure it quits working now if

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,189
it quits working then there's broad

158
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,979
consensus that is that is in fact a

159
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,990
violation of the rule of sovereignty the

160
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,789
question which is unanswered which we

161
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,210
could not answer which I don't know the

162
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,710
answer to is what about situations in

163
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,409
which there's interference with

164
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,989
functionality but it's not permanent

165
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,360
it's not broken because I don't care

166
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,210
whether you hit my laptop with a hammer

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,129
or with malware if it doesn't work it's

168
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,739
a paperweight the effects are the same

169
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,680
but what about a situation where it

170
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,229
simply slows down or a situation where

171
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,969
it doesn't do what it's intended to do I

172
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:36,180
type M it hits L what about these

173
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:38,490
situations unclear unclear in

174
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,919
international law and also unclear and

175
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,620
international law is a situation in

176
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,378
which there is no impact on

177
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,180
functionality but nevertheless the

178
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,879
effects are harmful and an example would

179
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,400
be the deletion of data is this a

180
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,650
violation of sovereignty well we're

181
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,109
waiting for States to opine on this

182
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,020
issue in our view this is where the

183
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,740
place should be for States we did agree

184
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,659
that espionage is not itself a violation

185
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,569
of sovereignty but the way in which you

186
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:12,500
conduct it may in some cases be a

187
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:16,710
violation so to give you a few examples

188
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,199
close access operation stick a something

189
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,089
in the USB port clearly that would be a

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
violation because it requires someone to

191
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,050
do it on the territory of your state

192
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
violation of sovereignty causing

193
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,240
permanent damage by causing a system to

194
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,550
overheat sovereignty violation rendering

195
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,320
the disk inoperable because they are

196
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,078
encrypted if it's permanent

197
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,229
sovereignty violation if it's temporary

198
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:42,149
I don't know the answer to the question

199
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,640
remotely being inside the system causing

200
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:47,130
it to slow down I don't know I'm waiting

201
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,560
for states to opine on this issue

202
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,290
putting malware in a system I don't know

203
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,199
we're waiting for States to opine on

204
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,269
exactly

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,760
where that line of breach of sovereignty

206
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,829
occurs well what about what about

207
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,200
operating inside the system

208
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:04,300
well the mere fact you're inside another

209
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,160
state system I'm not so sure that's a

210
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,959
violation of sovereignty and it

211
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,329
certainly is not a violation if all

212
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,579
you're doing is probing for open ports

213
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,920
looking for vulnerabilities and so forth

214
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:17,888
so that's the first way you may violate

215
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,500
sovereignty has to do with territory the

216
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:23,649
second way you violate sovereignty has

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,589
to do with what governments do remember

218
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,040
the exclusive functions of a state so if

219
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,250
one state interferes with the inherently

220
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,689
governmental functions a legal term

221
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,600
inherently governmental functions of

222
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,940
another state or who SERPs those

223
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,100
functions then it has violated the first

224
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,529
state sovereignty what do we mean by

225
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,380
inherently governmental functions those

226
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:52,899
things that states and only states do

227
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:55,779
like hold elections like collect taxes

228
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,600
so to take two examples when is it

229
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,240
interference if I conduct the DDoS

230
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,089
operation even if there is no damage

231
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,730
whatsoever but it interferes with the

232
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,519
collection of the taxes violation of

233
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,019
sovereignty who serpant other states

234
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,019
functions inherently governmental

235
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:17,709
functions I conduct a law enforcement

236
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:19,959
operation to bring down a botnet

237
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,810
structure infrastructure in another

238
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,199
state without that state's consent I

239
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,119
have performed law enforcement on the

240
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,880
territory of another state which enjoyed

241
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,610
the exclusive right to perform that

242
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,880
function I will tell you I've been

243
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,920
around doing this for quite some time

244
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,800
most of us never doubted this at all and

245
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,199
in fact in 1999 the US Department of

246
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,760
Defense released a very important

247
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,649
assessment on international law in

248
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,939
cyberspace where the Department of

249
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,910
Defense took the position that

250
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,980
sovereignty applies in cyberspace that

251
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,990
if you cause effects on another state's

252
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,199
territory it implicates the rule of

253
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:04,209
sovereignty so at this point everything

254
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:06,490
is hunky-dory until May of 2018 in May

255
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,279
of 2018 something very high import

256
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,800
happens the then Attorney General of the

257
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,540
United Kingdom Jeremy Wright comes out

258
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,819
with a statement at Chatham House

259
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,219
talking about the UK position on

260
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,080
international law and it's an important

261
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,360
position I mean it's an important

262
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,180
statement because he serially goes

263
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,310
through lots of issues like attribution

264
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,209
and state responsibility and use of

265
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,760
force and self-defense and time after

266
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:36,339
time he's he's hitting right in the

267
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,399
middle of consistent and concurrent

268
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,440
state practice so I applaud the

269
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,910
statement because it's a great statement

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,010
it shows the courage of a state in

271
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,990
setting forth its legal position and

272
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,770
most states have not done so today

273
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,020
however there is one paragraph in there

274
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,449
that sparks a debate in the

275
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,029
international community and it has to do

276
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,459
with sovereignty and what jeremy wright

277
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,040
tells us is that for the united kingdom

278
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:06,010
sovereignty is not a rule that may be

279
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,020
violated it's a broad principle of

280
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,029
international law from which other rules

281
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,339
like the rule prohibiting the use of

282
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,320
force or the rule prohibiting and

283
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,600
intervention in the internal affairs of

284
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,230
another state it's the source of those

285
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,920
rules but it's not a rule in itself if

286
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,899
the United Kingdom conducts a cyber

287
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,510
operation into another country you may

288
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:32,410
never say it has violated the

289
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:35,740
sovereignty of that nation well that was

290
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,500
a shock to the international law system

291
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,079
we began a dialogue that continues to

292
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,770
this day so what I'd like to do in the

293
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,229
remaining time is test the premise was

294
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,500
Jeremy Wright was the United King

295
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,920
in arguing that there's no such thing as

296
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,579
a rule of sovereignty well it would

297
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,459
appear in my view that they were wrong

298
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:03,069
very very wrong if you look at past

299
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,219
judicial treatment and past state

300
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,779
practice in this area for example and

301
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,029
I'll go through these quickly we've

302
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,850
leaves v-hull who many of you know and I

303
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,160
have written a long article 32 pages

304
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,230
long in the Texas Law Review where we

305
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,300
have page after page after page after

306
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,070
page of examples of states take

307
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,650
to position that sovereignty may be

308
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,600
violated so here are some of them

309
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,810
perhaps most important for this

310
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,130
discussion is the 1926 Lotus case which

311
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,189
was before the permanent Court of

312
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,400
international justice the predecessor to

313
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,520
the International Court of Justice there

314
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,740
in a case involving Turkey and France

315
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,140
the court said listen there is a rule of

316
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,090
sovereignty you may not exercise your

317
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,310
power in another States territory rule

318
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,840
of sovereignty and if there is any

319
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,599
situation that permits such an intrusion

320
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,270
there will be an express rule of

321
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,470
international law providing that case

322
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:05,120
providing that fact in 1949 we now have

323
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,570
the International Court of Justice and

324
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,570
in its very first case its very first

325
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,790
case sovereignty is the key and it finds

326
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,640
that the United Kingdom violated the

327
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,699
sovereignty of albania by minesweeping

328
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,590
in albanian waters so we have the

329
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,900
permanent Court of Justice laying down

330
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,330
the role and we start seeing the court

331
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,420
the World Court applying this in case

332
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:32,630
after case it applies it again in 1974

333
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,849
in a famous case called nuclear tests it

334
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,610
had to do with Australia complaining

335
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,640
about French nuclear tests and the fact

336
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,640
that radiation or radioactive material

337
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,250
would float into Australian territory

338
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,350
the court dismissed the case on other

339
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,750
grounds it's not important why but the

340
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,020
court found that sovereignty applied in

341
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,800
this case if one state causes effects in

342
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,829
another state the rule of sovereignty is

343
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,990
implicated 1986 perhaps the most famous

344
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,750
case before the International Court of

345
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,430
Justice Nicaragua and the United States

346
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,070
the United States was doing some rather

347
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,589
strange stuff in Nicaragua mining

348
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,220
harbours arming training guerrillas

349
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,470
financing guerrillas they they even

350
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,050
produced a manual on how to assassinate

351
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,790
someone of course Nicaragua complained

352
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,040
more than a little took it to the

353
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,290
International Court of Justice and the

354
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,980
court held that the u.s. action was a

355
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,829
violation of sovereignty and this is

356
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,579
very important because the brits argue

357
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,910
that there's the

358
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,888
principled sovereignty from which

359
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,769
intervention emerges and from which the

360
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:46,309
use of force emerges but in this case

361
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:48,889
the ICJ says they are three separate

362
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:51,850
violations of international law there is

363
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,529
a distinct and separate rule of

364
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,379
international law and then mountains of

365
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,839
state practice the Israelis in the 1960

366
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,910
are in 1960 seized Raley's roll into

367
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,439
argentina and grab a Nazi war criminal

368
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:12,079
Eichmann bring him back to try him in

369
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:13,998
Israel the UN Security Council remember

370
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,128
which includes the United States and

371
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:18,110
Russia and China the United States

372
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,509
Security Council condemns the action as

373
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,600
a violation of sovereignty indeed when

374
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:25,189
the case arises in the district court of

375
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,040
Jerusalem the district court of

376
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:31,579
Jerusalem also finds this to have been a

377
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,639
violation of sovereignty then in 1978 a

378
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,638
Soviet satellite breaks up cosmos 954

379
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,249
breaks up reenters the atmosphere over

380
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,799
Canada Canada complains you've just

381
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:46,759
violated my sovereignty you've just

382
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,029
caused effects on my territory in Canada

383
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,569
one and there was an agreement on on

384
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:56,149
reparations and so forth 2001 a US and

385
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:58,910
Chinese aircraft hit each other over

386
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,249
international waters the US aircraft has

387
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,069
to penetrate Chinese airspace to land

388
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:06,919
China says you violated our sovereignty

389
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:09,918
the United States does not protest the

390
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,559
United States says yes but we had a

391
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,260
legal we had a legal right to do so

392
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,379
because there is a special rule that is

393
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,269
called the rule of distress remember

394
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,720
when I was talking about the first case

395
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:26,179
before the PC IJ the Lotus case general

396
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,330
rule of sovereignty but here we have a

397
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,159
special exception we conduct drone

398
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,110
operations the Americans conduct drone

399
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:35,450
operations in Pakistan Pakistan

400
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,879
complains so do other states on the

401
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,980
basis of violation of sovereignty the

402
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,409
United States does not say we want we

403
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,450
did not violate your sovereignty the

404
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,990
United States says there is a special

405
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,760
rule that's the rule of self-defense

406
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,870
we don't contest the violation of

407
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,730
sovereignty Russia invades at Ukraine

408
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,899
and Russia conducts activities in

409
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,429
Georgia the West condemns it has what a

410
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,210
violation of sovereignty in addition to

411
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:08,809
a use of force and other violations in

412
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,670
2006 Iran captures US sailors that were

413
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:13,700
in a riverine craft that had made its

414
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,350
way got lost made its way into Iranian

415
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,450
waters the United's

416
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,459
they claim you violated our sovereignty

417
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,620
we had the right to grab those sailors

418
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,960
answer from the United States you're

419
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,149
right we apologize and thank you for

420
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,670
giving those sailors back State

421
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,830
Department legal adviser Harold Koh says

422
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,690
sovereignty applies in cyberspace in a

423
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,809
very important speech at US Cyber

424
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,820
Command 2012 in which he sets forth the

425
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,399
u.s. position on international law in

426
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,559
cyberspace a few years later his

427
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,530
successor Brian Deegan does exactly the

428
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,480
same at a speech at Berkeley says the

429
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,170
same thing sovereignty applies in

430
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,780
cyberspace

431
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,120
you see sovereignty in treaties the

432
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,850
treaty on on transnational organized

433
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,770
crime contains an express rule that says

434
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,350
that one state may not conduct law

435
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,929
enforcement operations in another state

436
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,939
why because it would violate the

437
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,820
sovereignty of that state sovereignty is

438
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,160
mentioned in core Corp treaties like the

439
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,320
Organization of American States Charter

440
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,050
and the United Nations General Assembly

441
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,330
has over and and Security Council over

442
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,830
and over and over and over again said

443
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,080
that there is a rule of sovereignty

444
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,939
Hanna said it is violated in certain

445
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,260
cases it would appear crystal clear that

446
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,020
the United Kingdom is wrong on this

447
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,179
point I want to emphasize I applaud the

448
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,429
United Kingdom for coming out and

449
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:38,120
setting forth its position and what I

450
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:41,179
believe is correct in every other aspect

451
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,629
but here they are wrong and their error

452
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,730
comes with a cost it comes with a cost

453
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,559
because it makes them difficult makes it

454
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,220
difficult for states adopting this

455
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,020
position to name and shame now I work

456
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,970
with international relations people a

457
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,179
lot and they say our name and in shaming

458
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,820
that it's not hey every time a state

459
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:04,070
conducts an unlawful activity

460
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,230
whether in cyberspace or not they

461
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,240
justify that activity on the basis of

462
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,720
international law international law did

463
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,690
not matter they would not do so and so

464
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,240
you this creates a buying for states

465
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,440
taking this position very important in

466
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,860
October 2018

467
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,990
GCHQ issues a press release condemning

468
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,800
the Russians for lots of violations of

469
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,150
international law in cyberspace for

470
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,159
exfiltrating data for damaging cyber

471
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,190
infrastructure for gaining unauthorized

472
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:38,360
access unlawful and lawful a lawful

473
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:42,020
unlawful but where's the beef if you

474
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,689
take sovereignty off the table exactly

475
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,690
what did the Russians violate because

476
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,730
it's very difficult to get to the level

477
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,680
of a violation of the principle of

478
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,290
non-intervention and it's really

479
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,090
difficult in cyberspace to say one state

480
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,990
used force against another

481
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:02,389
if sovereignty is not a rule there is no

482
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:06,110
basis for the British condemnation of

483
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,430
most of the Russian activities you've

484
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,229
heard in this conference from the

485
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,330
president of this nation by the way

486
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,760
about countermeasures countermeasures

487
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,409
are activities that would normally be

488
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,450
unlawful but for the fact they're

489
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:21,590
designed to get the other side to knock

490
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:24,860
off it's unlawful activities well if

491
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,800
that's the case if sovereignty is not a

492
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,199
violation of international law then the

493
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,409
victim state will not have the right to

494
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,810
take countermeasures the advocates of

495
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,080
this position say hey don't worry

496
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:41,659
because sovereignty is not violated by

497
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,720
most IP is never violated by cyber

498
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,210
activities that means we can respond in

499
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,520
cyberspace without violating

500
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,730
international law ourselves but they

501
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,950
forgotten an important point

502
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:57,730
countermeasures need not be in kind what

503
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,370
if your state that lacks offensive cyber

504
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,040
capability and you want to respond to

505
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,159
this violation to impose pain on the

506
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,540
other side to make them stop I I'm not

507
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,610
sure what the offense of cyber

508
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:14,840
capabilities of this country are I'm

509
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,649
sure they are not hugely robust Russia

510
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,740
conducts

511
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:21,440
cyber operations against Estonia what

512
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,110
will Estonia want to do maybe a

513
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,809
countermeasure in cyberspace but maybe

514
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,179
close the waterline off the coast to

515
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,250
innocent passage by Russian vessels

516
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,950
you may now not pass through our

517
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,900
territorial waters even though you had a

518
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,470
right to do under the law of the sea

519
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,270
maybe Estonia will close the airspace

520
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,100
Russian civil aircraft better on

521
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,550
unscheduled service have a right just to

522
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,139
fly into Estonia Chicago convention but

523
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,320
it would be entirely appropriate for

524
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,620
Estonia to say sorry you're violating

525
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,040
our sovereignty and so we're closing our

526
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,559
airspace until you stop now those

527
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,000
measures have been taken off the table

528
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,678
and then there's the rule of due

529
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,679
diligence which says the state has an

530
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,860
obligation not to allow its territory to

531
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:12,050
be used for activities that are adverse

532
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,669
to the interest of another state with

533
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:18,010
regard to its rights under international

534
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:21,050
law so now again I'll pick on Russia

535
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:23,030
Russians unaffiliated with the state or

536
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:26,240
we can't get attribution conduct

537
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,460
operations against Estonia if their

538
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,980
sovereignty then Estonia may be able to

539
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,010
say hey Russia you're in breach of your

540
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,600
due diligence obligation make them stop

541
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,330
because you have a legal obligation to

542
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,939
do so and if you do not we will take

543
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,389
countermeasures like no more ships in

544
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,910
our waters lying off our coast but if

545
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,820
there's no sovereignty if there's no

546
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,920
sovereignty then you cannot complain

547
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,590
that the Russians are violating their

548
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,110
obligation because the obligation of due

549
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,909
diligence only applies when there's a

550
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:03,709
legal rule that is being violated and

551
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:07,580
finally I would say that taking this

552
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,890
position is problematic because it

553
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,220
hobbles credibility it hobbles

554
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,780
deterrence and it hobbles escalation the

555
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:20,990
West has accused correctly so by the way

556
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,270
Russia and China of cherry-picking in

557
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,860
international law this rule we like we

558
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,330
like this sovereignty thing because it

559
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,340
gives us lots of control over what

560
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,299
happens on our territory well but

561
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,309
self-defence

562
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,559
we don't want to mention that in a gge

563
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,600
report international humanitarian law

564
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,119
not so fast with international

565
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,299
humanitarian law correctly accused of

566
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:44,330
cherry-picking but if we start doing the

567
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,999
same we lose our credibility and we will

568
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,168
undercut the rule of law in the

569
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:51,460
international community

570
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:56,119
moreover deterrence is about imposing

571
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:59,690
costs I can impose cost if you take a

572
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:02,539
particular action but as I've explained

573
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,960
this sovereignty is not a rule approach

574
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:08,899
takes lots and lots and lots of

575
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,419
potential cost I could impose on a bad

576
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:13,850
act or a bad state off the table

577
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:16,759
deterrence is weakened and the risk of

578
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,559
escalation goes up because now intervene

579
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,980
international law does not intervene

580
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,330
early on to say knock it off

581
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,820
international all intervenes when the

582
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,970
cyber operations are very very very

583
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,759
severe intervention is a hard standard

584
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,909
to meet and what this means is this rule

585
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,980
allows lots and lots of a hostile cyber

586
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:39,529
operations going back and forth between

587
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,539
States without those operations being

588
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:43,879
unlawful with the people who take this

589
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:47,330
position have forgotten is that

590
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:50,539
international law is robust it does not

591
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,609
leave States defenseless in the face of

592
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:55,279
hostile cyber operations there are lots

593
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:57,799
of things you can do you do not need to

594
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,950
claim there is no sovereignty so you can

595
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:03,019
take robust responses you may engage in

596
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,749
rhetoric you may engage in

597
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:08,359
countermeasures you may engage based

598
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:10,759
upon the plea of necessity and should

599
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,859
the cyber operation against you rise to

600
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:14,690
the level of an armed attack you may

601
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,090
engage in self-defense

602
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,889
to those who would claim they need a

603
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,408
rule of no sovereignty to provide a

604
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:24,080
robust defense of their cyberspace I

605
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:27,320
would say give me the situation where

606
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,389
international law does indeed keep you

607
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,230
defenseless and I would I would suggest

608
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:36,168
there very very few of those situations

609
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,669
so in conclusion Bravo to the Brits for

610
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,429
having the courage to be one of the

611
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,480
first states to set forth their policy

612
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,400
and

613
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,400
fourth their policy in a way that has

614
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,299
pinpoint accuracy except for this one

615
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,120
point and this is a very very dangerous

616
00:26:50,299 --> 00:27:02,750
trend we are seeing and with that I will

617
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:04,399
stop and turn to my next panelist and

618
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,780
thank you very much Mike for this

619
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,030
compelling and passionate presentation

620
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,700
and especially I think the key takeaway

621
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,980
for non-lawyers for policy people and

622
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,620
strategy people should be that without

623
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,720
having serenity as a rule this really

624
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,000
takes away the ability for states to

625
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,700
respond on international law using for

626
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,549
example countermeasures or gives away

627
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,190
the possibility to apply the principle

628
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:30,679
of due diligence to a large extent so

629
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,910
thank you Mike for this let's take a

630
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,970
couple of questions from the audience

631
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,549
but before we do so let me ask the first

632
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,820
question myself on the previous stage we

633
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:43,910
have talked a lot about cyber operations

634
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,860
that may cause friction among allies and

635
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,850
there was especially a good presentation

636
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,639
by max weeds

637
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:54,260
where he described the activities or the

638
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,590
alleged activities of the US Cyber

639
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:01,040
Command and the scenario that he rolled

640
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,610
out was that what if the Cyber Command

641
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,100
of State Day

642
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:10,520
targets the networks of states B which

643
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:13,189
is its ally because in the networks of

644
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,620
state B there is a certain part of the

645
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,070
network that is under the control of an

646
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,699
adversary State C and that state C is

647
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,260
using that part of the network for

648
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,480
malicious activities for launching

649
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,510
malicious malicious attacks against

650
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,850
state a the World Cyber Command is and

651
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,360
let's assume that those activities are

652
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:39,110
for example deleting content changing

653
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,049
passwords and the like so I know you

654
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,149
briefly mentioned this type of a

655
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,679
scenario in your presentation but how

656
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,690
would you comment on this would you say

657
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,970
that in this case this cyber command is

658
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,770
breaching the sovereignty of its ally

659
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,290
and in this scenario we assume that

660
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,530
there is no direct consent for such

661
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,908
activity from

662
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,620
well that mean that's a complicated

663
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:02,870
scenario I would need a lot more facts

664
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,370
to give you a definitive answer but in

665
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,610
the broadest sense the answer appears

666
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,620
fairly simple it's an ally so you go to

667
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,860
the ally and you ask for consent to

668
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,870
bring down those to bring down the

669
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,418
malicious activity in the event the

670
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,100
state does not grant its consent that

671
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,289
state is probably in breach of its due

672
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,820
diligence obligation because of it

673
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,770
because it's in breach of its due

674
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,230
diligence obligation is breaching an

675
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:30,789
obligation to you which allows you to

676
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:33,380
take countermeasures and so you may then

677
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:35,980
whether it's a breach of sovereignty or

678
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,419
not you may then go into those systems

679
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,030
thereby violating the sovereignty of the

680
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:43,309
state that you're acting into your ally

681
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,408
state B and bring down those systems

682
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,690
yourself has a form of countermeasure

683
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,909
not against the bad actors not against

684
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,039
state C but has a form of countermeasure

685
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:54,409
against they B for its failure to comply

686
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:56,870
with its due diligence obligation so I

687
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:59,390
would see not a lot of these issues if

688
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,908
this is the case when state B does not

689
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,820
give the consent but what if the state B

690
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:07,190
is not to ask for it if it's a

691
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,620
unilateral activity okay well state B

692
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:12,049
should be asked okay that's that's easy

693
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,850
and since it's your ally you should be

694
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:18,650
nice okay okay that's good so it kind of

695
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:21,830
works well with what Mad Max was saying

696
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,679
in in his speech that without asking for

697
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,840
such consent or without exchange of

698
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,940
communication about these operations it

699
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,158
can really cause frictions amongst the

700
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,710
relationships of the allies now I would

701
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,059
say so the president I wasn't here but

702
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,260
I've read this I read the speech this

703
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,120
morning the president made a very

704
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,379
important point with regard to

705
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
countermeasures collective

706
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,760
countermeasures one of the things and

707
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,289
and and I support her but one of the

708
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,990
things that countermeasures is that

709
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,760
there's a requirement of notice and so

710
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,799
if you're going to take a countermeasure

711
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,440
if I want to make you stop something I

712
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,080
have to say listen if you don't stop I'm

713
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,299
going to make you stop in the u.k

714
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,530
statement the UK said that there's no

715
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:06,200
obligation to do that that's a position

716
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,970
cut and that's despite the fact that the

717
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,289
general rule is that I gotta say hey

718
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,000
knock it off and if you don't knock it

719
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:14,190
off I'm gonna make I'm gonna do this bad

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,230
thing to you to cause you to what the

721
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,909
Brits said with regard to that was the

722
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,070
rule of notice doesn't make much sense

723
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:22,320
the requirement of notice doesn't make

724
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,389
much sense in cyberspace because if I'm

725
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,730
placing you on notice well then you're

726
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,679
gonna take measures that will defeat my

727
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,809
countermeasure in advance that's a

728
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,600
position we took in the tall Immanuel

729
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:35,190
and and and that's why it's so very

730
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,469
important that states come out and say

731
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,720
what their what their actions are what

732
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,820
their position on international law is

733
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,260
so this is sort of a variant on counter

734
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,600
measures that should not be missed at

735
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,610
the conference okay great all right do I

736
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,230
see a sea of hands for questions that

737
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,510
start first with here and the second

738
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,309
question the gentleman over there thank

739
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,140
you sir I have a question regarding the

740
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:56,610
temporary functional damage that you

741
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,309
mentioned in the beginning of your

742
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,559
presentation could it be compared to a

743
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,710
violation of airspace which is also

744
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,740
temporary and why not could we use the

745
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,450
same time or not and let's take the

746
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,010
second question I was just right after

747
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:21,539
and then I can answer both of them a

748
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:22,530
gentleman here professor Schmidt thank

749
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,820
you for a presentation

750
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:29,879
I was I was mesmerized by your last

751
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,490
sentence really because I was under the

752
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,150
impression that the UK position was a

753
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:39,030
singular one and your last sentence

754
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:42,570
mentioned a trend could you elaborate on

755
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:45,928
that so let me take the first question

756
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,549
first once you have a violation of

757
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:49,230
airspace everyone agrees that the

758
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,700
sovereignty violation has already

759
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,280
occurred that the damage has already

760
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,370
occurred the question with regard to the

761
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,230
temporary your argument makes sense okay

762
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,928
it's just that the states have not come

763
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,730
to that conclusion yet and so I just

764
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,990
spoke on this in Israel when we were

765
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,850
doing the Tala manual we were

766
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,679
extraordinarily conservative because we

767
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,649
did not want to get out ahead of States

768
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,860
I would suspect that some states will

769
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:16,260
say that if you have a temporary

770
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,840
disruption depending on the severity of

771
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,149
that disruption the consequences the

772
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,770
effect that that would also qualify as a

773
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:25,050
violation of sovereignty

774
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,340
and they would and I think your argument

775
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,649
about the temporary violation of

776
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,179
airspace because of a jet pops in and

777
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,190
pops out it's still a violation of

778
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:35,280
airspace would be an argument that they

779
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,960
would look to we just felt uncomfortable

780
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,450
going that far because of the unique

781
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,190
nature of cyberspace with regard to the

782
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,810
second question you know there is a

783
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,430
trend so I travel around and talk to

784
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,379
States a lot I'm involved in a project

785
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,540
with the Dutch and Australian and

786
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,810
Singapore in the United States to train

787
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,690
government officials the trend started

788
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,010
with the Americans when Colonel Gary

789
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,090
Court is a very dear friend of mine a

790
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:02,330
real smart guy published a paper a blog

791
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,919
actually and then subsequently a paper

792
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,560
arguing that there is no such thing as a

793
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,870
violation of the rule of sovereignty he

794
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,080
was joined by Bob Taylor who was a

795
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,960
recently retired very senior person in

796
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,960
the Department of Defense and then the

797
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,720
then general counsel of the US

798
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Department of Defense produced a paper

799
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:27,120
which took exactly the same position

800
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,720
that paper was distributed to the

801
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,880
combatant commands it went viral

802
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,949
it was unclassified it went viral and

803
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,649
was subsequently classified so I can't

804
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:40,049
talk about the specifics but we at least

805
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:43,889
see the trend in the Department of

806
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,679
Defense tracking exactly what the Brits

807
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:51,080
did in the May 2018 statement when I

808
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,490
travel around states are really really

809
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,429
conflicted on this and in great part

810
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:59,250
it's because many states rely upon the

811
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:01,980
the United Kingdom for a lot the United

812
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,480
Kingdom is a very powerful country and

813
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,450
then with regard to the United States

814
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,910
many countries are really wondering what

815
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,279
the u.s. is going to do the u.s. has not

816
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,580
taken a position on the issue but states

817
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,070
are jumping to the conclusion that our

818
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,860
position is consistent with the British

819
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:23,190
position because the DoD came out and

820
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:25,170
made these various statements so I guess

821
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,000
I over misspoke myself

822
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,800
there is certainly a trend in the United

823
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,840
States there is an express statement in

824
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,450
the UK and as I talked to officials from

825
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,190
Colombia to Thailand they're scratching

826
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,390
their heads wondering what they should

827
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,519
be doing

828
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,660
hey thank you Mike and let's turn to now

829
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:45,118
our next speaker dr. Barry Sanders from

830
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:49,529
doing his postdoc at fundus al-qaduli

831
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,799
Americas in Brazil and dr. sander is

832
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:55,109
doing his research mostly on global

833
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:57,660
cybersecurity norms human rights and

834
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:59,400
technology and international criminal

835
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,558
law and the presentation will be on a

836
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,960
very interesting topic that also Mike

837
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:08,059
touched upon the silence of States and

838
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,059
giving their legal assessments thank you

839
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:14,160
okay good morning everyone

840
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:15,989
thank you Anna Maria and let me begin by

841
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,319
saying what a privilege it is to be ATS

842
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:21,269
icon this is my first saikhan frankly

843
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,089
it's my first time in Estonia at all

844
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:26,640
I've had a fantastic time the debates

845
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:28,349
have been extremely high-level I'd like

846
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,799
to thank the organizers for inviting me

847
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:34,200
and a particular shout out to Tomas Minh

848
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:37,200
Eric who in my hour of need not only

849
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,589
found me speaker cards but also found me

850
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,098
nice CCDC OE branded speaker cards which

851
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:45,890
I was very excited about the title of my

852
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,210
talk today is the sound of silence

853
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:52,440
international law and the governance of

854
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:56,039
peacetime cyber operations and my point

855
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,099
of departure really is an observation

856
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:02,299
and the observation is that recent years

857
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:06,059
have witnessed rising anxieties

858
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:08,640
concerning the silence of states with

859
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,339
respect to how international law applies

860
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,808
in a cyber domain and over the past few

861
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:16,319
days for those of you who attended the

862
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:18,839
other law panels I think these anxieties

863
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,859
or frustrations have been somewhat

864
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:25,069
apparent and in particular it's been

865
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,630
anxieties over silence concerning

866
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:28,890
peacetime sight the applicability of

867
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,140
international to peacetime cyber

868
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,549
operations by which I mean those which

869
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,308
are below the threshold of use of force

870
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:39,089
and occur outside the context of an

871
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:40,460
armed conflict now the silence of states

872
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:43,529
according to the conventional narrative

873
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,739
has manifested itself in at least four

874
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:49,860
different forms so first there are a

875
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:51,690
lack of cyber specific

876
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,820
multilateral treaties and there seems to

877
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,380
be a reluctance on the part of states or

878
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,910
lack of interest to enter into new ones

879
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,160
this also seems to be a reluctance on

880
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,430
the part of states to come out and

881
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,140
clarify their position concerning how

882
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,870
cust existing customary international

883
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,150
law applies in the cyber domain with of

884
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:17,330
course notable exceptions one of which

885
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:19,590
formed the topic of mic speech thirdly

886
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:22,770
some scholars have pointed to the fact

887
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:26,600
that the fact that states have begun to

888
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:29,460
talk about non-binding voluntary norms

889
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,759
of cybersecurity side in cyberspace

890
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,340
responsible behavior in cyberspace that

891
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,650
shift itself represents a shift away

892
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,210
from the vocabulary of international law

893
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,420
and that's obviously a contested

894
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:48,150
statement but there are people who

895
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,830
suggest that and finally the silence of

896
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,440
states is also apparent in the

897
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,090
propensity of certain states to name the

898
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,760
involvement of other states in hostile

899
00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:00,720
cyber operations but then studiously

900
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,270
avoid shaming them with recourse to the

901
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,000
vocabulary of international law again

902
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,130
there are some exceptions to that so

903
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,710
that's the conventional narrative now I

904
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:13,860
don't argue in my paper that this is

905
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,770
necessarily inaccurate but I do argue

906
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,020
that it is somewhat incomplete it's not

907
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,050
the whole story and what I argue is for

908
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,540
greater specificity when we look at the

909
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,190
silence of states concerning the

910
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:30,080
applicability of international law how

911
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,080
international replies to cyberspace and

912
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,710
my point of departure for that is to

913
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,650
first of all distinguish different types

914
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:40,170
of peacetime cyber operations so first

915
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,690
you have peacetime cyberattacks these

916
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:46,380
are acts of state or non-state actors

917
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:48,870
attributable to state which use cyber

918
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,400
capabilities to alter disrupt degrade or

919
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:53,009
destroy computer systems or the

920
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,470
information resident in them essentially

921
00:39:53,010 --> 00:40:00,750
these are destructive cyber operations

922
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:03,149
then you have peacetime cyber espionage

923
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,340
operations these are

924
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,180
it's of State or non-state actors

925
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,420
attributable to a state which

926
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,779
clandestinely

927
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:16,260
or under false pretences use cyber

928
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,440
capabilities to copy information from

929
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,000
closed as opposed to open sources so

930
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,100
essentially we're talking about

931
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,840
information gathering operations and

932
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:31,140
finally we have peacetime cyber

933
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,290
information operations and these are

934
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,120
acts of state or non-state actors

935
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,279
attributable to a state which

936
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,710
clandestinely or under false pretences

937
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,590
use cyber capabilities to deploy

938
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:47,940
information to influence political

939
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:52,680
sentiment in another state now obviously

940
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:55,680
in reality any cyber operation in the

941
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,720
real world may have various aspects of

942
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,060
each of these but for the purposes of

943
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,799
legal analysis it is useful to

944
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,509
distinguish them and that's why I've

945
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,400
defined these types of cyber operation

946
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,990
by defining them according to their

947
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,540
underlying acts so what I do in the

948
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,729
paper is I take each of these different

949
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,580
types of cyber operations and then I

950
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,730
look at the purported silence of States

951
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,560
in relation to those cyber operations

952
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,610
and I try to really show that state

953
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,080
silence is not uniform but varies

954
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:31,350
according to at least one of three

955
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,810
questions so first what are the targets

956
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,700
of the state silence our state silence

957
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,440
about international law in general or

958
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,939
only in relation to particular rules of

959
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:45,090
international law on particular aspects

960
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:47,610
what is the scope of state silence are

961
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:50,930
all state silent on a particular issue

962
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:54,180
or only particular groupings of states

963
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,100
and finally what are the rationales what

964
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,350
are the potential I have to hypothesize

965
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,819
here because there's not too much in the

966
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,460
public domain but what are the possible

967
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,440
rationales behind state silences in

968
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,850
different contexts what are the possible

969
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,800
technical political and legal reasons

970
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:13,980
behind state silence and I argue that by

971
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,930
doing this deconstruction of state

972
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,869
silence it reveals an important

973
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,529
dimension of

974
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:23,529
politics of international law and also

975
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:26,289
enables a more nuanced evaluation of the

976
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:30,460
appropriateness of silence in different

977
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:35,339
contexts okay so that's the basic aim of

978
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:38,859
the paper so let's begin with peacetime

979
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:40,900
cyberattacks now if you review the

980
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:42,490
peacetime cyberattacks that I have made

981
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,990
the public record and I'm sure there are

982
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:48,700
many that haven't but those that have

983
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,788
then we can distinguish a number of

984
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,230
different situations

985
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:54,640
first there are situations and this can

986
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,099
change over time of course but you have

987
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,118
situations where states have been silent

988
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:05,470
about whether a cyber incident resulted

989
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,529
from an accident or a cyber attack and

990
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,029
here I give the example of Stuxnet

991
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:12,880
because it was not immediately clear to

992
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:15,279
Iran whether the problems that it had

993
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,910
with its nuclear facilities were the

994
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:20,650
result of an external attack or simply

995
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,779
failures of its internal operating teams

996
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,660
that was of course the point but

997
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:29,499
nonetheless resulted in silence on that

998
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:32,470
issue for some time secondly we have

999
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:34,799
situations where it's clear there's been

1000
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:38,919
an attack that reaches the public domain

1001
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:42,309
but States fail to attribute that attack

1002
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,009
to another state and also declined to

1003
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:48,819
declare whether any response measures

1004
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:51,849
have been taken and here I would give

1005
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:53,829
the example of the Shamoon malware which

1006
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,440
was deployed against Saudi Arabian and

1007
00:43:53,829 --> 00:44:00,190
Qatari private and public sector targets

1008
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,720
between 2012 and 2017 which today have

1009
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,960
not been attributed officially a

1010
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,538
publicly to another state and no non

1011
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,950
covert any way known on covert response

1012
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:17,019
measures have been taken third situation

1013
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:19,720
is where a state will identify cyber

1014
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:22,029
attack attribute that attack to another

1015
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,629
state may even take some response

1016
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:27,880
measures but will decline to define that

1017
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,230
attack as a violation of international

1018
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,570
law

1019
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:36,980
here we have the example of the Sony

1020
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:40,670
hack so this involved the deployment of

1021
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:43,160
destructive malware which caused tens of

1022
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:46,790
millions of dollars of damage to Sony's

1023
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:49,129
computer infrastructure the US was

1024
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:52,430
willing to attribute that attack to

1025
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:55,340
North Korea but Secretary of State Kerry

1026
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,430
was only willing to define the attack as

1027
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:01,340
a flagrant disregard of international

1028
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:03,710
norms and President Obama used the

1029
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,070
famous phrase that the attack was an act

1030
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:11,390
of cyber vandalism a term with no clear

1031
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:14,570
legal connotation and finally you have

1032
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,850
situations where a state identifies a

1033
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:19,940
cyberattack attributes it to another

1034
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,350
state takes response measures declares

1035
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,869
that there has been a violation of

1036
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:26,509
international law but then does not tell

1037
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:28,730
us which rules of international law has

1038
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:30,950
been violated and here we have the

1039
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,369
example which Michael Schmidt mentioned

1040
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:36,200
in his presentation of the UK exposing

1041
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,030
together with its allies exposing

1042
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,029
operations of Russian military

1043
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:44,030
intelligence some of which included

1044
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:46,190
destructive cyber attacks and the UK was

1045
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:49,730
only willing to declare this it was

1046
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,859
willing to attribute it to Russia but it

1047
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,450
declared that the pattern of behavior

1048
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:55,759
was a flagrant violation of

1049
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,549
international law without going the step

1050
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,810
further as specifying which rules had

1051
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:04,609
been violated okay so what's going on

1052
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,910
here what are the possible rationales

1053
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:11,029
behind these different types these

1054
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:13,970
different targets of state silence well

1055
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,890
we can divide them into two so if we

1056
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:20,140
look at the failure to publicly identify

1057
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,140
a tribute or respond to a cyber attack

1058
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,770
one factor may simply be evidential the

1059
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:31,580
state may lack the evidence to either

1060
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:33,680
identify that an attackers Kurd or it

1061
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:37,580
may lack evidence to attribute that

1062
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,390
attack whether it's attributing it to a

1063
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:43,430
computer a person or ultimately the

1064
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,029
state each of those steps it may lack

1065
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,020
evidence

1066
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:54,650
each stage the second set of reasons are

1067
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:57,140
political a state may fear that

1068
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:00,290
attributing an attack to another state

1069
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:03,529
may escalate the situation it may

1070
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:06,670
disrupt ongoing diplomatic efforts in in

1071
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:10,780
other issue areas completely unrelated

1072
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:14,600
it may even be able to use the threat of

1073
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:16,460
attribution publicly in private that of

1074
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,049
the state may use that spread privately

1075
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,770
in order to gain some strategic

1076
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:24,080
advantage or it may simply conclude that

1077
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:27,170
it has inadequate response measures and

1078
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,210
therefore publicizing publicly

1079
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:33,470
attributing the attack is is essentially

1080
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:36,050
self-defeating now when it comes to

1081
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:38,480
failing to publicly explain whether a

1082
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,710
violation has taken place of

1083
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,450
international law and in particular

1084
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,340
which rules have been violated

1085
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:48,710
we might be able to point to various

1086
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:50,990
factors of play first the state rightly

1087
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,970
or wrongly may believe that

1088
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:56,479
international law is simply inadequate

1089
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:59,470
it's not worth it it's not worth

1090
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,150
claiming there's a violation for example

1091
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,370
the state may believe that the limits

1092
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:05,750
that are placed on counter measures such

1093
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:08,450
as the notice and proportionality

1094
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:12,440
requirements mean that they're just not

1095
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:13,899
worth it's just not worth referring to

1096
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,490
international law in this context

1097
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,500
resourcing can be taken in any case

1098
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:23,200
without declaring a violation of

1099
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:26,150
international law secondly there may be

1100
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,720
disagreements either within a particular

1101
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:31,910
state or between states on what the law

1102
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,209
is on a particular in response to a

1103
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:38,029
particular situation particularly when

1104
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:40,280
states are formulating a collective

1105
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,230
response this may lead to silence on

1106
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:49,340
which particular rule has been violated

1107
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:52,580
and relatedly states may be torn between

1108
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,350
a restrictive desire sorry an offensive

1109
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,950
desire for permissive rules in

1110
00:48:54,350 --> 00:49:01,130
cyberspace and a defensive desire for us

1111
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:04,669
liberals in cyberspace which may leave

1112
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,349
them in the UK's case for example to

1113
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,960
simply state that there's been a

1114
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:10,820
violation of international law but not

1115
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,720
go further in state what that violation

1116
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:18,170
is so those are some of the rationales

1117
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,770
and that's our first issue area cyber at

1118
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:24,859
peacetime cyberattacks turning to cyber

1119
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:27,589
espionage now traditionally espionage

1120
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:30,078
the approach that states have taken has

1121
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:34,759
been to criminalize espionage at the

1122
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,520
domestic level and be silent as to the

1123
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:41,480
legality of espionage operations under

1124
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,180
international law but with the advent of

1125
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,820
cyberspace the espionage landscape has

1126
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:49,310
been transformed to some extent it's now

1127
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:54,230
easier to remotely access enormous

1128
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:56,599
volume of information and non-state

1129
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,190
actors are now implicated in cyber

1130
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,310
espionage operations to an unprecedented

1131
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:03,260
degree particularly with state with

1132
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:05,920
respect to state surveillance programs

1133
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,900
and the bulk collection of personal data

1134
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,140
in this environment under increasing

1135
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:16,460
pressure from civil society groups and

1136
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,920
companies states have begun to be more

1137
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:22,280
vocal about the legality of cyber

1138
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,609
espionage but not all states and not all

1139
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,060
rules so here we can draw a distinction

1140
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:31,009
and I draw in the work of Ashley Deeks

1141
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:33,109
in making this argument we can draw a

1142
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:37,190
distinction between rules that protect

1143
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:39,290
the rights of states such as state

1144
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,910
sovereignty and rules that protect the

1145
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,579
rights of individuals such as human

1146
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:46,098
rights law so when it comes to rules

1147
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:48,950
protecting the rights of states states

1148
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:51,910
continue to adopt a policy of silence in

1149
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:55,520
relation to cyber espionage operations

1150
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:58,520
for example in response to the Snowden

1151
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,650
disclosures in 2013 only a small

1152
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,040
minority came out and declared that the

1153
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,150
activities of the NSA and its allies

1154
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,310
constituted a violation of state

1155
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:11,450
sovereignty Brazil being one of those

1156
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:13,339
minority by contrast there has been much

1157
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:16,040
more nor

1158
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:19,250
on the international arena concerning

1159
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:22,099
the compatibility of cyber espionage

1160
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,270
operations with rules that protect the

1161
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:25,280
rights of individuals such as

1162
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,309
international human rights law and we

1163
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,319
see this not only in statements made

1164
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:32,240
after the Snowden disclosures there's

1165
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,859
also been a number of UN General

1166
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,299
Assembly resolutions and Human Rights

1167
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:38,900
Council resolutions on the right to

1168
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:41,720
privacy in the digital age and perhaps

1169
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,609
most importantly there's also been a

1170
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,649
number of cases brought for

1171
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:50,328
International Human Rights bodies and

1172
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:52,819
regional Human Rights courts where the

1173
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:56,030
court has actually examined these types

1174
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:58,730
of activities so for example the recent

1175
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,630
case of Big Brother Watch and the UK at

1176
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,589
the European Court of Human Rights

1177
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:06,140
offers an example of that so what's

1178
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:09,470
going on here why the silence in

1179
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:13,879
relation to state focus rules compared

1180
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:15,859
to individual focus rules well one for

1181
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,540
one thing there is more external

1182
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:19,400
pressure to comply with human rights law

1183
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,549
there's more pressure from civil society

1184
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,440
groups there are courts involved there's

1185
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:27,230
just more going on in relation to human

1186
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,990
rights law certainly it's easier to

1187
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:32,990
ignore the state focus rules it's quite

1188
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,790
unpalatable for a state to openly avow

1189
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:36,709
that it's not complying with human

1190
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:40,190
rights law and it's even in its

1191
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:42,619
surveillance operations and finally in

1192
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,049
perhaps most importantly I think states

1193
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,240
have realized that they can quite

1194
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:48,650
happily comply with international human

1195
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,140
rights law and still have quite an

1196
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:54,020
extensive that's been our surveillance

1197
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,029
program whereas were they to claim that

1198
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,339
espionage programs violated for example

1199
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,799
state sovereignty that would constitute

1200
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:05,240
a major inhibition on their operation

1201
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:07,400
two major restriction okay so that's our

1202
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,689
second category cyber espionage

1203
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:13,730
operations okay we tend to the final one

1204
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,099
which is cyber information operations

1205
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,059
now with the rise of social media

1206
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:19,040
information operations have obviously

1207
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:21,230
become increasingly prevalent we all

1208
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,410
know of the Russian disinformation and

1209
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,180
trolling campaign in the 26 2016 US

1210
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,700
presidential election

1211
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,770
now the international record since the

1212
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,649
International regulation of cyber

1213
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:37,160
information operations necessarily

1214
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:40,240
embroiled States in issues of defining

1215
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,250
the boundaries of freedom of expression

1216
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,680
given the contentiousness of that area

1217
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:47,329
it's unsurprising that there is division

1218
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,419
of approach on how states have

1219
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:53,869
approached that question so here we have

1220
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,880
one cluster of states including China

1221
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:58,309
Russia and other members of the Shanghai

1222
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,500
Cooperation Organization who have been

1223
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:02,599
highly vocal regarding the International

1224
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,099
regulation of information operations

1225
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:08,930
under the banner of information security

1226
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:10,730
for example in the draft international

1227
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,649
code of conduct for information security

1228
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:17,420
submitted to the UN General Assembly in

1229
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:18,589
2011 that provided for curbing the

1230
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,869
dissemination of information that

1231
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:23,240
undermines other country's political

1232
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:26,980
economic and social stability as well as

1233
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:31,700
their spiritual and cultural environment

1234
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:34,789
by contrast a separate set of states

1235
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:38,379
have been much more reticent to discuss

1236
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:40,579
the international legal regulation of

1237
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,230
information operations at the

1238
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:46,819
multilateral level and I include here

1239
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:49,160
the US and the EU generally they prefer

1240
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:50,058
to focus on narrower technical security

1241
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:54,618
threats under the banner of

1242
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:57,609
cybersecurity why well I think one of

1243
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:59,599
the reasons at least is fear that

1244
00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:03,200
entering into a kind of international

1245
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:05,869
legal dialogue would only serve to help

1246
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,669
legitimate the intrusive censorship

1247
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:11,359
practices of more digitally

1248
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:13,010
authoritarian governments and I would

1249
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,828
argue that's one reason why when

1250
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,319
President Obama was responding to the

1251
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:21,020
Russian information operation on the

1252
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,058
u.s. presidential election he referred

1253
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,240
to it as in violation of established

1254
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:27,289
international norms of behavior

1255
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:33,169
studiously avoiding the language of

1256
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:35,930
international law so that is our third

1257
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:39,320
area cyber information operations and

1258
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:44,359
I'll now move to conclude

1259
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:46,690
so the basic point of my paper is was to

1260
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,970
illuminate that silences are not uniform

1261
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:53,060
but their underlying purpose targets and

1262
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:57,259
scope varies according to the security

1263
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:59,210
threat that we're dealing with and that

1264
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:03,020
this is an important way to view how

1265
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,490
international law works in practice so

1266
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,410
I'm going to skip through that just to

1267
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,029
give you the implications of my analysis

1268
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:11,390
because I think that's important with my

1269
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:14,470
final few seconds there are three

1270
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:16,430
implications to my paper first it

1271
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:18,080
illuminates an important dimension of

1272
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:20,720
the politics of international law when

1273
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,610
states are silent on the international

1274
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,029
domain that does not necessarily mean

1275
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:27,560
it's because there is no law or they're

1276
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:30,110
not sure what the law is as I've tried

1277
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,730
to emphasize it could be strategic it

1278
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:33,530
could be for political reasons it could

1279
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,870
be for evidential reasons there are a

1280
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,830
whole host of reasons that motivate

1281
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:42,170
States silences in different contexts

1282
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:45,770
relatedly and this is an important point

1283
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:49,490
state silence is not necessarily a bad

1284
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:51,410
thing okay I think as international

1285
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:53,120
lawyers we sometimes want States to come

1286
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:55,160
out in every context and clarify the law

1287
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,870
but there may be things going on behind

1288
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,210
the scenes and there may be legitimate

1289
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:01,279
reasons in terms of technical capacity

1290
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:04,280
which mean that states which motivate

1291
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,630
the state silences so when we in examine

1292
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,520
state silence is going forward I think

1293
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,700
we need to have a broader picture of the

1294
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,170
different factors that are at play and

1295
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,120
the final implication is that I think

1296
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,690
this research project sets the

1297
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:20,480
foundations for a couple of extra

1298
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:23,980
research avenues for the future and here

1299
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:28,700
I refer to I'll put one forward which is

1300
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:31,610
how can we what inferences can we draw

1301
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,830
from state silences in terms of

1302
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:36,590
understanding the meaning of

1303
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:40,100
international law in what contexts does

1304
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:42,200
the silence of a state inform the

1305
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,480
content of international law and I'll

1306
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:50,120
leave it there thank you very much

1307
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:52,770
[Applause]

1308
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,380
thank you very much Barry sander for

1309
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,880
this overview of state silences and the

1310
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,890
reasons behind it if you're interested

1311
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,010
in more detail please have a look at the

1312
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:04,920
Proceedings of saikhan and we have time

1313
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:09,840
for one quick question before yes place

1314
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:12,030
here on the corner so I want to pick up

1315
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,070
on your last question which was how much

1316
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:17,490
Hyuna for the state silence and in

1317
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:20,400
particular what can you infer from the

1318
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:21,990
fact that basically nations haven't

1319
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,000
complained about the destructive about

1320
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,509
cyber attacks as violations of

1321
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,680
international law and are we creating

1322
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,990
regardless of the reason of why they're

1323
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,700
silent are we creating a legal regime

1324
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:34,169
which is essentially international legal

1325
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:38,069
regime which is essentially safe for a

1326
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:41,970
cyberattack to do thank you for that

1327
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:43,020
question that's fantastic question so I

1328
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,310
didn't have time to put it in a

1329
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,580
presentation I'm really glad you asked

1330
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:49,950
that question but what I would refer to

1331
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:52,350
and I think it's a useful document is

1332
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,540
the international law Commission has

1333
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,890
released its draft conclusions on the

1334
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:59,250
identification of customary

1335
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:03,470
international law and in draft

1336
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:06,570
conclusion ten paragraph three it states

1337
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:09,359
failure to react over time to a practice

1338
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:12,960
may serve as evidence of acceptance as

1339
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,720
law opinio juris provided that states

1340
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:19,160
were in a position to react and the

1341
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:21,779
circumstances called for some reaction

1342
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:25,140
now breaking that down in the commentary

1343
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,490
it then states that whether a state was

1344
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,529
in a position to react relies on

1345
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,330
knowledge and knowledge can be assumed

1346
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,810
from circumstances knowledge of the

1347
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,810
practice
