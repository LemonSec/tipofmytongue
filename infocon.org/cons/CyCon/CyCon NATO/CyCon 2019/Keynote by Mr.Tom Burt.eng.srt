1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,210
well thank you very much for the

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,100
opportunity to speak with you for a few

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,059
minutes today and what I was hoping to

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,460
do today is to update this group on the

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,169
work that Microsoft has done in the year

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,849
since my colleague John Frank had an

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,009
opportunity to address you a year ago as

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,779
well as to talk about some of our

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,270
thoughts about what we need to do to be

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,509
successful in this space going forward I

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,090
don't need to convince this group of the

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,680
real empowerment that technology brings

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,519
to citizens and communities around the

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,930
world whether we're talking about

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,579
communication creativity productivity

16
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,309
there's just such a wide range of ways

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,680
in which the technology can advance the

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,328
welfare of our citizens and that with

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,700
the advent of cloud computing the

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,090
opportunity for that is really limitless

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,340
but we see and we fear that the dark

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,039
side of technology can impose

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,140
limitations on the ability of the world

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,020
to really benefit from the opportunities

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,090
of Technology again there's no one in

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,579
this audience who isn't aware of both of

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,159
these key considerations nation-state

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,680
attacks and cyber crime for profit and

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,220
how they both are continued to grow

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,229
and to be very impactful on citizens and

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,000
communities around the world and what

32
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,009
we've seen in the trend especially in

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,100
the last year is that the lines between

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,680
these two have continued to blur as

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,360
we've seen increasingly that there are

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,009
whether you think of them as mercenary

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,900
organizations state control

38
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,310
organizations sometimes it's hard

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,159
especially for those of us in the

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,590
private sector to really know but we see

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,780
the same activity groups engaging in

42
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,210
espionage activity in nation

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,360
state-sponsored attacks but also in

44
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,740
efforts to simply steal money and

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,990
working in that way and we see that

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,140
increasingly among all of the rogue

47
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,890
nations that are engaged in activity

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,659
that we think is is reprehensible and

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,390
just for a moment to talk about

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
nation-state attacks and the evolution

51
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,009
of those attacks there's a couple of key

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,979
lessons here you know starting with the

53
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,160
early attacks like the the DDoS attack

54
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,440
on Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,599
attack which actually showed that a

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,620
nation-state could reach across the

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,048
border you

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,099
using cyber and no kinetic effort at all

59
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,900
can influence an exam extend its power

60
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,709
and authority across the geographic

61
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,900
border to actually disabled nuclear

62
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,390
centrifuges and these lessons have been

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,579
learned by the nation states that engage

64
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,909
in these attacks and you see over time

65
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:37,860
how this is evolved from those kinds of

66
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,280
targeted destructions to massive data

67
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,709
exfiltration to the supply chain attacks

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,959
that we see today becoming much more

69
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,420
sophisticated including things like the

70
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,760
not pecchì attack where the adversaries

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,670
recognize that by infiltrating the

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,040
update system of a popular software

73
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,140
package they could quickly gain trust

74
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,420
and get their malware distributed

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,190
broadly throughout an entire country and

76
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,399
then of course through all of the

77
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,510
commercial enterprises that had

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
activities in that country causing

79
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,709
billions of dollars in economic damage

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,260
we see attacks on critical

81
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,510
infrastructure and how that continues to

82
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,910
evolve and is a significant concern for

83
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,638
governments around the world and then as

84
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,380
we get more current evolutions you've

85
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,819
seen things like the evolution of

86
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,530
espionage and attacks for a service with

87
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,629
for-profit companies operating quite

88
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,480
openly and supplying these kinds of

89
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,858
weapons and exploits to governments that

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,010
don't have the resources to do it

91
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,260
themselves and in we now are clearly on

92
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,048
the edge of seeing machine learning and

93
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,448
and AI technologies being brought to

94
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,120
bear not just on the defense side but on

95
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:51,569
the side of the attackers and what they

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,000
can do to improve the the scope

97
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,910
effectiveness and power of their attacks

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,980
and what's significant about this and

99
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,910
what you see in just slightly over a

100
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,730
decade in terms of the evolution of how

101
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,590
nations are using cyber to engage in

102
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,959
these attacks and I'm not just talking

103
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,549
about the kinds of espionage that there

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,870
are traditional activities of the

105
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,370
government that we have to anticipate

106
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,019
will continue to be traditional

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,649
activities of government but really

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,358
attacks that harm citizens and

109
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,950
enterprises in times of peace that's

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,539
something that's really unique and I've

111
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,969
heard many speakers talk about how

112
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,950
that's operating under the threshold of

113
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,630
armed conflict but two recent

114
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,330
developments are of interest here one is

115
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,790
just this month when a cyber attack

116
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,950
against Israel resulted in a kinetic

117
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,420
response with Israel bombing the

118
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,990
location from which they had identified

119
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,170
that that cyber attack by Hamas had

120
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,550
emanated that is a concern I know for

121
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,890
governments around the world

122
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,140
when will cyber attacks and the

123
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,070
influence of cyber attacks result in

124
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:58,979
kinetic responses and it's just to see

125
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,140
that happening of course in reality

126
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,580
which raises the visibility of that

127
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:08,280
concern for us all so what I'd like to

128
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,349
spend my time today talking about is

129
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,690
what is Microsoft doing what have we

130
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,700
done in the past year in our efforts to

131
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,980
address these issues to raise visibility

132
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,780
to encourage dialogue and to actually

133
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:24,450
encourage action to to to try to bring a

134
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,609
greater sense of security to cyberspace

135
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,770
so one of the things we've done is we've

136
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,800
taken action to disrupt nation-state

137
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,080
actors we've actually done this three

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,780
times with legal process and once with a

139
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,210
purely technological effort in which we

140
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,080
have now targeted nation-state actors

141
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:46,229
operating from North Korea from China

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,250
most recently from Iran and probably our

143
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:52,680
most intensive effort has been to to

144
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,919
wrestle with a nation-state actor from

145
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,220
Russia one that we call strontium it's

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,990
also known as apt 28 or fancy bear but

147
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,790
this is the group that was responsible

148
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,840
for a lot of the efforts to influence

149
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:09,660
the u.s. presidential election in 2016

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,359
the the Mueller investigation resulted

151
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,800
in a very specific and very interesting

152
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,650
indictment against the individuals

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,050
responsible for some of this activity

154
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,880
but Microsoft have engaged in a legal

155
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,729
battle with strontium now for a couple

156
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,030
of years starting in 2016 when we saw

157
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,070
strontium registering fake domains using

158
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,719
our trademarks and trade names and the

159
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,330
trade names of other technology

160
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,950
companies as the basis for conducting

161
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,479
the infrastructure for a lot of their

162
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,520
attacks

163
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,889
and so we went to court treated this

164
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,620
nation state actor like a botnet we're

165
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,050
my team are my digital Crimes Unit at

166
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,050
Microsoft is really the world leader in

167
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,360
disrupting and taking down for-profit

168
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,400
cybercrime botnets and we took the same

169
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,189
legal approach went to court and got

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,669
orders transferring to our sinkhole this

171
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:05,370
long list of domains that strontium was

172
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,438
using to conduct its operations and we

173
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,210
also constantly watch their operations

174
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,189
that is called out here we saw it

175
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,370
announced earlier this year the

176
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,020
targeting by strontium of organizations

177
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,810
that seem to be associated with the

178
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,930
democratic processes in six different EU

179
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,249
countries and we notified those targets

180
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,560
so they were aware and could take steps

181
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:27,930
to protect themselves but the activity

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,389
of strontium is not focused just on the

183
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,110
US but it's focused on processes around

184
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,479
the world and so what we have managed to

185
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,099
do with in 12 different times going to

186
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,050
court is we've taken down to eighty four

187
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,938
domains used by strontium and we

188
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,889
actually have one we just got another

189
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,289
order we're about to execute on to take

190
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,110
down several more domains by strontium

191
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,449
we don't pretend that this activity is

192
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,680
going to stop what strontium is doing

193
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,449
there to well-resourced

194
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,870
they're too much of an important part of

195
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,330
the strategy of Russia to engage in this

196
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,120
kind of activity but what it does is it

197
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,029
does add some friction we have seen that

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,789
strontium is much less frequently using

199
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,310
Microsoft domains as part of its domain

200
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,110
structure for its infrastructure which

201
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,139
means that much less frequently our

202
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,669
customers are deceived by strontium into

203
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,229
thinking that the communication they're

204
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,448
having with those domains is really

205
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,068
communication with us or some of the

206
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,560
other technology companies that have

207
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,449
given us permission to police this

208
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,560
activity by this organization on their

209
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:34,050
behalf so so we have had that impact

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,779
we've also as a result gotten quite a

211
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,958
bit of data about the organization

212
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,029
that's that strontium has effectively

213
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,250
compromised and we've been able to

214
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,079
advise those organizations the fact that

215
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,459
they have been infected by strontium so

216
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,739
they could take action to clean their

217
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,140
environment but much more needs to be

218
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,920
done this is just our effort to say what

219
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,189
can we do

220
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,599
with the relatively limited resources

221
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:00,358
that we have to bring to bear to this

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,790
effort to try to do some disruption and

223
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:05,429
to let these actors know that we are

224
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,019
interested in stopping their activity

225
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:09,540
when they're targeting citizens and

226
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,480
enterprises in times of peace in

227
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,679
addition to that activity of course as I

228
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,559
think you all know we've been very

229
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,559
active on the public policy side on

230
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,939
trying to work to develop the norms and

231
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,169
the principles that governments will

232
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:26,790
live by in cyberspace and there's some

233
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,499
reason for progress there's been

234
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,358
progress in the past year and reason for

235
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,609
hope in addition to all of these

236
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:34,739
different as part of all of these

237
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:36,389
different efforts that have been engaged

238
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:37,980
in the past year and that are going to

239
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,559
be going forward with the the two

240
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,480
different UN processes in later this

241
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,329
year in in coming years we were

242
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,549
particularly gratified to have the

243
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,699
opportunity to assist the French

244
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:52,559
government in its effort to develop the

245
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,019
Paris call for trust insecurity in

246
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,969
cyberspace when we heard that the French

247
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,910
government was making this effort we

248
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,889
joined with them to advocate for

249
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,809
governments for for civil society and

250
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,209
for technology companies around the

251
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:08,579
world to come together and endorse these

252
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:13,549
principles as a step of pulling together

253
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:15,988
a truly multi-stakeholder voice

254
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:19,110
supporting these key principles of

255
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:21,149
cybersecurity and it's interesting we

256
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,399
did some work to chart out the nine

257
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,069
principles of the Paris call because

258
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,259
each one of them is derived from a

259
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,929
previous governmental statement of some

260
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,360
kind about principles or norms of

261
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,889
cybersecurity and it's interesting to

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,869
see how some of those have been repeated

263
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,149
in different ways over the years some

264
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:41,369
were relatively new but we found all

265
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:44,069
nine of these principles to be key

266
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:46,199
aspects of what we need to do to

267
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:50,219
preserve the security protect the

268
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:52,949
security of the cyber world much more

269
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,559
needs to be done and we are hopeful that

270
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,449
we will find the opportunity to join

271
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,419
together with other interested parties

272
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:02,248
in this in a set of communities that

273
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,439
will take each of these principles and

274
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:06,810
say what can we do with each of these

275
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:08,640
principles what needs to be done to

276
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,160
to move them forward into international

277
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,500
law what needs to be done so that we can

278
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,020
actually have deterrence for those who

279
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,270
seek to violate these principles there's

280
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,670
much that needs to be done to make more

281
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,100
of the Paris call and not let it just

282
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,189
stop with this endorsement but the

283
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,800
endorsement itself is very important 65

284
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,720
countries have been signed the the Paris

285
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,599
call principals but over five hundred

286
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,880
and fifty different entities between

287
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,520
civil society the technology industry

288
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,580
and governments have signed the paris

289
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,860
call the largest multi-stakeholder

290
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,710
statement of cybersecurity principles

291
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,590
ever we need to take that momentum and

292
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,360
use it to develop more in terms of what

293
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,100
we can do to take those principles and

294
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,830
make them real and make them effective

295
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,150
and not just a statement and so we're

296
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,800
committed to working with other

297
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,689
interested parties in developing these

298
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,790
communities to continue the discussion

299
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,490
and move forward because as you could

300
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,469
see from that evolution of cyberattacks

301
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,530
the one thing that we know for sure is

302
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,990
our adversaries are not spending times

303
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,329
at spending their time at important

304
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,800
conferences like this saikhan conference

305
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,970
they're not spending their time

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,000
wordsmithing

307
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,220
the precise words to be used in stating

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,500
a norm they're not spending their time

309
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,290
thinking about how do we transfer those

310
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,480
those those norms into effective

311
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,310
international law and how do we then

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,340
move from international law to actual

313
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,619
deterrence they are simply taking action

314
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,830
and they're evolving quickly and they're

315
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,720
moving quickly and so as a community we

316
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,810
need to increase the pace of our

317
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,210
activity increase our resolve to combat

318
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,979
those adversaries by moving in the

319
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,380
appropriate ways in the ways that we are

320
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,270
with thoughtful discussion but we need

321
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,540
to move forward more quickly into

322
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,850
deterrence and that's why we support the

323
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,250
United States defend forward effort that

324
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,490
it's engaged in with as we understand it

325
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,100
many allies because we think that we do

326
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,150
need to find a way to create deterrence

327
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,250
so that the nation states who today

328
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,480
operate with really no consequence

329
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,920
whatsoever begin to recognize that

330
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,810
misbehavior in cyberspace isn't

331
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,199
free isn't free and there's not freedom

332
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,550
of action but with all of this work that

333
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,070
we've done and the work we've done to

334
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,889
support the Paris call the work that we

335
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,630
do at Microsoft to work with governments

336
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,550
around the world on how we can

337
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,920
strengthen cybersecurity we also

338
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,430
recognize that the first responsibility

339
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,790
lies with industry the cyber that this

340
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,829
as a domain of conflict cyberspace is

341
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,139
unique and we heard this from a couple

342
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,569
of the keynotes yesterday because it is

343
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,120
the creation of private industry it is

344
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,490
maintained by private industry and it's

345
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,560
evolved by private industry and that

346
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,230
means we also have the responsibility to

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,869
ensure to the best of our ability the

348
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,970
security of cyberspace and so one of the

349
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,339
things that we thought we should do and

350
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,660
you heard about this last year was try

351
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,660
to bring together the technology

352
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,670
community to endorse core principles of

353
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,130
cyber security because somewhat

354
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,709
surprisingly you did not see the

355
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,800
industry itself coming together to agree

356
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:25,859
on core principles so we established the

357
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,079
cybersecurity tech Accord and the tech

358
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,120
Accord we just asked technology

359
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,339
companies to stand up for four key

360
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,810
principles first that we would do what

361
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,060
we could with our engineering and our

362
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,420
process to protect our users and

363
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,869
customers everywhere secondly that we

364
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,819
would not support in any way government

365
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,339
efforts to develop weapons or launch

366
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,610
weapons that target innocent civilians

367
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,050
and enterprises in times of peace third

368
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,760
that we would work with our customers

369
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,459
and governments around the world to

370
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,040
increased cybersecurity resiliency and

371
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,959
finally that we would work together for

372
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,469
how we could respond to cyber attacks

373
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,750
more quickly and more effectively and we

374
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,180
started with just over 30 signatories to

375
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,040
that to the tech Accord on when was

376
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,050
launched a year ago and i think i think

377
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,410
john frank mentioned this at his speech

378
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,829
but today we have over a hundred and six

379
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,480
companies from around the world from 21

380
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:24,300
countries that have endorsed the tech

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,339
accord and i'm pleased to say given the

382
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,319
leadership of estonia in the

383
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,819
cybersecurity space that one of the

384
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,310
signatories is guard time

385
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:33,270
one of the companies spaced here in

386
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,239
estonia

387
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,550
but not only do we have a hundred and

388
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,580
six signatories and the number continues

389
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,199
to grow as the technology industry

390
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,870
recognizes the importance of these four

391
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,640
key principles but I'm very gratified to

392
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,170
see that that organization has moved

393
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,959
beyond something that Microsoft

394
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,089
originally inspired to an organization

395
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,449
that is acting very much on its own

396
00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:00,240
behalf to address key issues of

397
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,580
cybersecurity policy and to endorse

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,920
those that we as a community a tech

399
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,200
community a global tech community think

400
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,260
should be adopted and expanded globally

401
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,450
and we also are working on what we can

402
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,399
do as a technology industry so for

403
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,410
example right now there's an effort

404
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,649
within the tech Accord to make sure that

405
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:23,250
we all have endorsed our processes for

406
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:25,950
coordinated vulnerability disclosure so

407
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,110
these companies increasingly as I meet

408
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,730
with governments in North America South

409
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,040
America Europe and Asia

410
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,529
I find that governments increasingly are

411
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,170
pleased to see that we have now a voice

412
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,570
for the technology community on cyber

413
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,180
security that they can turn to to ask

414
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,040
and query what does not just a single

415
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,109
technology company but the global

416
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,079
technology industry think about these

417
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,120
cybersecurity principles there's one

418
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,250
other thing that I want to address in

419
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,829
the time I've got remaining which is the

420
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,899
defending democracy program this is a

421
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:00,870
program that my team launched a year ago

422
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,209
and that I am really excited about it

423
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,160
was inspired of course by the activity

424
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,990
we saw of our adversaries attacking

425
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,050
democratic principles and not just in

426
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,179
the US but in the in France right after

427
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,829
the 2016 election we saw activity in

428
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,199
many other countries around the world

429
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,349
we've seen efforts to actually disrupt

430
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,150
the democratic process and it's not I

431
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,969
think it's less important to our

432
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,610
adversaries that they actually favor a

433
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,880
candidate or another candidate it's more

434
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:32,760
a part of their strategy to simply erode

435
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,370
the confidence of the citizens in the

436
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,670
democratic process itself and to create

437
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:41,489
conflict on key issues in the countries

438
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,380
where democracy prevails and we've seen

439
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,630
them be incredibly effective with their

440
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,870
disinformation campaigns and their other

441
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,000
efforts to influence

442
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,870
the vote and we've learned more and more

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,130
over the last few years about how close

444
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,770
the Russian adversaries in particular

445
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,270
came to actually impacting the vote in

446
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,270
the United States and their efforts to

447
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,010
hack the voting systems of the US so we

448
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,590
created the defending democracy program

449
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,530
focused on these three core pillars what

450
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,990
can we do what can Microsoft do uniquely

451
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,910
and bring to the community to the two

452
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,580
democracies of the world to support

453
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:18,190
election integrity the security of the

454
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,850
campaign's themselves and to combat

455
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,100
disinformation and we started with this

456
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,409
thing we called account guard I'm a

457
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,959
count guard was an effort to increase

458
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,990
the security of the campaign's where we

459
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,990
told any political campaign but also a

460
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,300
wide variety of associated organizations

461
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,640
that if they were office 365 customers

462
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,740
so that we had visibility into efforts

463
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,750
to attack them if they signed up for

464
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,390
account guard we would notify them of

465
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,370
any threatened attack by a nation-state

466
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,740
actor or any compromise by a

467
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,330
nation-state actor and in addition to

468
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,730
that we would conduct cybersecurity

469
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,678
seminars we would help the campaign's

470
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,600
understand how to operate in a secure

471
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,040
way and we would help them in the event

472
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,870
that they were compromised

473
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,510
as to how to solve their problem and

474
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,600
continue on securely we started in the

475
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,360
United States we then came to an of

476
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,639
countries in Europe we went to Australia

477
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,409
India and we recently expanded to

478
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,110
another number of other countries in

479
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:20,260
Europe we now cover 26 countries we've

480
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,178
had 36,000 separate campaign accounts

481
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,460
that have signed up for this account

482
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,280
guard and we've made many notifications

483
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,230
of nation-state attacks on those

484
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,210
organizations that has been a big

485
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,190
success for us but it isn't nearly

486
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,750
enough and we learned through this

487
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,340
process and if there's one thing that

488
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,679
I've been in my career at Microsoft

489
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,870
that's really enthused me about the

490
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,270
company is our willingness to learn too

491
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,580
as we try something and we get feedback

492
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,770
and we learn more than we we change we

493
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,750
evolve what we're doing to try to make

494
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,850
it more effective and we did that in

495
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,460
this case because we learned that as

496
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,379
good as a count guard was we were

497
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,020
constrained by the fact that office 365

498
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,550
was too expensive for campaigns which

499
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,860
often operate on very thin

500
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,350
budgets and it was too hard to deploy

501
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,949
securely so we have now announced

502
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:11,080
Microsoft 365 for campaigns and this is

503
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,410
an offering of our commercial Microsoft

504
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,679
EMM 365 service which has all our most

505
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:20,170
advanced security services included but

506
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,600
we are offering it to the same group of

507
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,360
organizations associated with campaigns

508
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,280
and democracies at our nonprofit price

509
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,280
which is a very very significant

510
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,500
discount and it's coming pre-configured

511
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,790
with Wizards that enable even

512
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:40,660
unsophisticated IT staff for campaigns

513
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:43,480
to easily deploy M 365 in a highly

514
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,460
secure way for the campaign process and

515
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,740
so that's our next step to trying to

516
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,560
help protect the campaign process itself

517
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,630
and we will be that's being launched now

518
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,429
this summer initially in the United

519
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,160
States but again we expect to make it

520
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:00,850
available in many other democracies

521
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,410
around the world and while I'm excited

522
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,379
by that because I think it will help us

523
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,020
help protect campaigns we've spent the

524
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,330
last year working on a project that we

525
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,980
just announced to really protect the

526
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,710
vote itself a program that we call

527
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,680
election guard and election guard is an

528
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,450
open source free software development

529
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,000
kit that we're gonna make available as a

530
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,040
project on github for everyone to help

531
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,910
us evolve it to improve it to make it

532
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,879
more effective

533
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,620
but what election guard is is a software

534
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,420
development kit that enables the

535
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:41,560
application of sophisticated technology

536
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:43,900
to provide a verifiable encrypted vote

537
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,060
so that the voter goes to the polling

538
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,220
place and votes and their vote is

539
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,919
encrypted and that encryption is

540
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,440
maintained the vote gets counted the

541
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,380
voter gets a receipt that they can then

542
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,200
use to go online and check and see that

543
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,600
their vote was properly counted and was

544
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,480
not tampered with but more importantly

545
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,540
than that the SDK enables voting

546
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,490
officials voting watchdogs journalists

547
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,550
or other interested parties to build

548
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,380
their own verifier app based on the sdk

549
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,360
so that they can look to

550
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,790
see that the vote was properly counted

551
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,409
and not tampered with now the

552
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,909
combination of encryption and the other

553
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,460
security features were building into the

554
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,160
SDK should make it very hard for an

555
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,080
adversary to hack the system but we know

556
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,180
that very hard and absolute are two

557
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,820
different things we don't pretend that

558
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,920
it's not hackable but what we are a

559
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,020
certain of is that if there's an effort

560
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,900
to tamper with the vote or the vote

561
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,700
count using election guard that effort

562
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,830
will be visible and known to the

563
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,540
election officials and in the way that

564
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,310
we are proposing it there would be paper

565
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,870
ballot backup that could be used you

566
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,330
could do the risk limiting audit which

567
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,489
is supported by this SDK or just

568
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,220
actually count paper ballots to ensure

569
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,380
the integrity of the vote we're going to

570
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,750
be making this available as I said as an

571
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,720
open source free effort this summer and

572
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,030
this summer we will also be creating and

573
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,150
providing for public inspection a

574
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,610
demonstration prototype of the kind of

575
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,710
very simple voting machine that can be

576
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,620
created from off-the-shelf inexpensive

577
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,240
components to enable this to occur so

578
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,060
that it's less expensive for voting

579
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,640
officials it's much much more secure and

580
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,590
it's also more accessible because we can

581
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,260
use this with accessibility components

582
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,120
so that so that people who are

583
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,490
challenged by using paper ballots today

584
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,520
will have the ability to vote and then

585
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:39,040
confirm the accuracy of their vote you

586
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,560
know I'm sorry just very quickly a video

587
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,230
on this topic suggested that a majority

588
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,480
of the country did not have confidence

589
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,010
that in fact votes would be counted and

590
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,340
counted accurately voter participation

591
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,230
is about confidence in the vote and to

592
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,510
be able to cast your vote and know that

593
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,280
was being counted properly the election

594
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,870
guard technology starts with our

595
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,180
software development

596
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,070
the voters vote remains encrypted

597
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,890
throughout the process in addition to

598
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,419
printing your ballot it prints a ballot

599
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,510
tracker that has on it a cryptographic

600
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,970
code any interested party can take our

601
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:16,060
open-source technology and look at the

602
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,190
vote as a whole and verify that it was

603
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,980
properly accounted there's so much

604
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,600
passion around these issues and watching

605
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,310
that come together to actually improve

606
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,429
our security it's extraordinary

607
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,159
[Music]

608
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,930
so I'm out of time but with all of this

609
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,090
work that we've done and that all of you

610
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,210
in this room have done looking to the

611
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,860
future we Microsoft remain committed to

612
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,470
our efforts to advance the cause of

613
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,620
cybersecurity defining the right Public

614
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,070
Policy the right rules of law to apply

615
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,159
the right ways of having a consensus

616
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,840
across the cybersecurity community as to

617
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,620
what rules of government should apply

618
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,199
and how we can deter the rogue nations

619
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,090
that insist on violating those rules we

620
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,940
will continue to apply our technology

621
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:08,500
and our advocacy to these goals and I

622
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,550
really appreciate all the effort by the

623
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,050
organization here to maintain this

624
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,000
conference which is one of the best

625
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,280
conferences to bring together so many

626
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,410
different voices around the world to

627
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,090
share our information that this the

628
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,920
panels yesterday we're great I look

629
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,169
forward to the ones today and I thank

630
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:29,059
you for your time

631
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:29,059
[Applause]
