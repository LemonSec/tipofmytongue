1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,609
Madam President Admirals generals ladies

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,340
and gentlemen and a special warm welcome

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,139
to the young people from all over the

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,370
world you are bringing special flavour

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,840
in this conference it's an honor to be

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,380
invited to speak to you today the

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,410
circumstances are very special for me

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:29,250
first I'm speaking here in Tallinn not

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,159
far away from Russia Estonia is the

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,590
virtual frontline of the cyber conflict

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:40,919
that just has started we all just begin

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,050
to understand its current and potential

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,039
future implications for everybody and

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:52,199
everything in our modern world and

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,340
secondly I'm talking about a topic of

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,190
which all of you here probably know and

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,899
understand way better than I could do

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,840
ever let me start my short presentation

19
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:11,479
was an example that shows impressively

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,750
that the digital revolution has its own

21
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:21,180
unstoppable pace the iPhone was

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,930
introduced in 2007 today only 12 years

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,829
later they are roughly eight point four

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:33,150
billion phones on the market which are

25
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,869
connected to the Internet this is just a

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,590
reminder on how fast our world gets

27
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,600
connected from the signal citizen to a

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:49,710
whole nations and to global industry and

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:53,329
organizations in a reality where cloud

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:58,229
computing and big data are the key words

31
00:01:53,329 --> 00:02:02,908
state institutions industry as well as

32
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:08,580
the whole society are dependent on free

33
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:12,690
and safe access to the cyberspace in our

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,480
modern world energy supply health care

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,890
systems

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,379
water and food distribution and the

37
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,230
whole administrative organization of

38
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:26,679
local and state government are

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:30,549
unthinkable without the ability to use

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,720
the cyberspace and of course ladies and

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,209
gentlemen I'm aware I don't have to

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,010
stress that point in the beautiful

43
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:44,260
capital of Estonia you are one of the

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,349
leading countries in the world in

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:52,030
digitalization of public services and

46
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:55,170
administration the speed of change

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:00,340
caused by this technological innovation

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:04,359
doesn't stop anywhere neither in the

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:09,269
security area nor does it stop with us

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,760
in NATO it offers us nearly unlimited

51
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:16,209
possibilities but also to malicious

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,989
actors who want to use those innovative

53
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:23,859
developments to harm our societies and

54
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:26,889
the Alliance in and through this

55
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:30,549
cyberspace and ladies and gentlemen

56
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:34,470
perhaps we are currently gradually

57
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:38,579
losing the war of cyberspace

58
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:43,799
self-imposed constraints on investments

59
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:47,220
limitations of law and policy consensus

60
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,239
reactiveness symmetry and

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,730
proportionality in response among others

62
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,829
leaves us far behind our adversary's

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:03,488
behavior in the cyberspace we have been

64
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:07,660
focusing most of our efforts on CIS

65
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:12,239
security and cyber defence of our

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:14,889
networks and systems in the meantime our

67
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,079
adversaries have been using the

68
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:23,830
cyberspace in a novel dimension they

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,540
have been using it as a tool and in

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,990
occasions

71
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,280
as a weapon below the threshold of

72
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:37,120
conflict we have to recognize conflicts

73
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,969
of the real world are transferred into

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:45,250
the cyberspace in Europe

75
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:48,010
this is visible every day cyber attacks

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,550
are constant and they don't only serve

77
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:55,240
the purpose of fishing for and gather

78
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:58,420
information especially here in the

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,340
Baltics big efforts are made by Russia

80
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,380
to influence and manipulate public

81
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:11,080
institutions and opinions through the

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:14,920
use of cyberspace even our NATO enhanced

83
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,609
forward present forces a target of false

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,650
information by trolls and BOTS there is

85
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:27,610
a constant fight in the net by now it's

86
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:32,700
reality that geostrategic intentions are

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:36,040
directly supported by cyber operations

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:41,280
our adversary's have tried this many

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:43,120
times denying service for whole nations

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,500
disrupting their critical

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:52,000
infrastructures exfiltration of data

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:56,530
about our civil servants planting mayor

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,050
vera ram in our networks disseminating

94
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:03,010
false information and creating social

unrest mingling international election

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:11,110
processes it is easy to see that our

97
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,849
adversaries are creating a bundle of

98
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:20,650
cyber-enabled tools to be used in future

99
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:24,070
hybrid warfare such future will see CIS

100
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:29,169
security eventually becoming a commodity

101
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:33,460
a complex one but just regular daily

102
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:37,660
business future warfare will seldom

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,370
bring us isolated standalone cyber

104
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,250
attack

105
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,250
cyber will be employed to create social

107

108
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,200
soldiers and their families deny our

109
00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:02,000
daily operations and create chaos and

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:06,110
terror additionally with relatively low

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,680
barriers to entry malicious actors can

112
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,350
attain the skills and resources required

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:20,390
to persistently engaged in disruptive

114
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,840
cyberspace activities and they do they

115
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,150
are ability to remotely manipulate

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:29,869
and/or disrupt activities through

117
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:34,210
cyberspace increases their opportunities

118
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:39,650
to rapidly generate generate effects by

119
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:43,840
complicating attribution if we only

120
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:47,479
prepare to secure our communication and

121
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,560
information systems we will fail

122
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,740
addressing the global hybrid and

123
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,670
comprehensive challenge already in the

124
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,880
Wales summit in 2014 the heads of states

125
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:05,500
and government agreed that cyber defense

126
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:10,969
is part of NATO's core task of

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:14,270
collective defence in 2016 at Warsaw

128
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:17,590
summit they pledged to enhance the cyber

129
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:21,320
defence of their national networks and

130
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:25,039
infrastructures they also recognized

131
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:30,280
cyberspace as a domain for military

132
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:34,849
operations alongside air land and sea

133
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,650
however cyberspace differs from all the

134
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:43,880
other domains as constantly evolving

135
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:46,880
man-made construct unlike other domains

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,930
NATO as an international organization

137
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,410
owns operates and protects

138
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:59,209
it's own portion of cyberspace the

139
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:02,540
so-called NATO enterprise by doing that

140
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:06,650
and recognizing cyberspace as a domain

141
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:10,849
of military operations we will be able

142
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:14,470
to improve NATO's ability to conduct

143
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,030
operations across all domains and

144
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:23,720
maintain our freedom of action and

145
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:27,020
decision in all circumstances NATO has

146
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,770
already taken steps to operationalize

147
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,949
this domain starting with identifying

148
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,199
the NATO cyber system gaps which are

149
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,220
being addressed in the NATO command

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,960
structure functional adaptation process

151
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,440
we have established a cyberspace

152
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:49,040
operation center and to enhance command

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,420
and control of our operations in and

154
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,000
through cyberspace allied command

155
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,880
transformation as the NATO warfare

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,110
development command does not only

157
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,689
develop capabilities for NATO indeed we

158
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,250
are very active in our cyberspace

159
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,060
operations activities we develop

160
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:18,760
transformative ideas of tomorrow's cyber

161
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:23,989
warfare invest in cutting-edge CIS and

162
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:30,010
CIS security infrastructure and validate

163
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:34,220
them in all sorts of realistic exercises

164
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:36,380
in addition to that we coordinate their

165
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,560
employment and ensure they are

166
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:44,120
interoperability with NATO member states

167
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:49,150
as well as partners to boost their

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,950
defensive and offensive capabilities

169
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,680
allied command transformation is heavily

170
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:59,300
involved in education and training

171
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:04,729
activities across the board and creates

172
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:08,060
awareness the resilience conference 2000

173
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:13,430
19 that was just conducted in April in

174
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:17,119
Norfolk is in good example this is how

175
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,620
we at allied command transformation try

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,350
to support in various areas such as

177
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,949
securing populations and cities in the

178
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,829
digital world developing protection for

179
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:33,790
critical infrastructure and develop a

180
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:39,319
broad range of Incident Response

181
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:43,849
capabilities but cyber is a recently

182
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:47,120
created demand for operations in NATO we

183
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:51,769
of course still neck the doctrine and

184
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,380
experience of centuries or decades as in

185
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:58,970
the traditional air married time and

186
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:02,949
land domains cyber warfare development

187
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:06,949
is essential urgent and requires a

188
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:11,569
significant level of effort which needs

189
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:13,939
to be prioritized over the last three

190
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:18,040
years we have focused on providing NATO

191
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:21,279
with cyber specific organizations

192
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,290
infrastructure and capabilities

193
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,889
associated doctrine and rules of

194
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:32,329
engagement to enable initial cyber

195
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:35,029
defence now the basic capabilities are

196
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,699
in operation Allied command

197
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:41,170
transformation needs to continue to

198
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:44,829
focus on cyber warfare horizon scanning

199
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:48,529
concept development innovation and quick

200
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,638
capability development to provide our

201
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,480
warfighters

202
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:58,880
with the capabilities they need to face

203
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,089
our adversary's on the same level this

204
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,680
is why we are developed make a

205
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:08,440
cyberspace strategic foresight in

206
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,120
evidence to determine our future needs

207
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,300
furthermore we develop forward-looking

208
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,270
concepts in the area of situational

209
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:22,490
awareness automated cyber injects

210
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,230
or insider threat detection capabilities

211
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:28,470
allied command transformation is working

212
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,740
along our sister organizations and many

213
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:36,690
other stakeholders to develop future

214
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:41,310
concepts for cyberspace both technical

215
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:44,520
and operational a good example is the

216
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:48,810
collaboration with the industry they are

217
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,600
key partners for us the industry does

218
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:56,040
not only provide us with technical

219
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,649
support and consultancy services but

220
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,730
also support us in applying lessons

221
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:07,100
learned and reusing knowledge from

222
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,100
nations and adopting new technologies

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,050
industry is present in nearly all of our

224
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:18,770
efforts in cyber activity and we would

225
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,770
like to increase this reliable

226
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,709
collaboration it is imperative to

227
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:28,589
include the use of modern technology

228
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:31,739
like big data analysis machine learning

229
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:35,070
modeling and simulation or other tools

230
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,490
to get a comprehensive picture of a

231
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:42,779
cyber attack and react tailored to the

232
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:46,380
threat this endeavor is far away from

233
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:51,209
being over because the ultimate goal

234
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:54,899
must be that we are able to operate from

235
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:57,779
Lau to a high intensity in the cyber to

236
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:02,250
men as we are able to operate in the

237
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:04,589
three other domains in fact I have to

238
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,250
admit that despite of our

239
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:12,329
accomplishments so far we still have a

240
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:15,180
long way ahead of us as we still will

241
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,140
have to work on cyber doctrine cyber

242
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,870
education and training exercises and

243
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,810
evaluation as well as at the political

244
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,290
level and especially with the legal

245
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,439
frameworks

246
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,399
we can already report some success

247
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:36,009
stories as now all NATO allies have

248
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:40,089
established silo policy frameworks and

249
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:43,329
some time of organization to coordinate

250
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:47,229
cyber defense and cyber security at the

251
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:50,108
national levels all of the allies have

252
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:54,189
even incident response capabilities by

253
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:56,410
now NATO is not alone with its efforts

254
00:15:54,189 --> 00:16:00,129
to have policy structures and mechanisms

255
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:05,679
in place to survive in the cyber space

256
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:08,499
to men the European reunion for example

257
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,419
established various various projects

258
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:13,509
within the framework of permanent

259
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:17,220
structured cooperation to counter and

260
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:20,379
react to attacks in the cyber sector

261
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,889
therefore I strongly support and in the

262
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:27,720
hands NATO EU cooperation in this field

263
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:33,339
as well for the benefit of both

264
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:37,359
organizations because NATO is the member

265
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:42,699
nations a resilient EU nation is at the

266
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:47,410
same time a resilient NATO member we at

267
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:50,459
NATO are dependent on your support we

268
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,529
need coherency with the efforts that

269
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:57,219
nations and external stakeholders are

270
00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:01,839
doing as replication and overlap are

271
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,149
luxuries we cannot afford we need the

272
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,350
best ideas from academia and their

273
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:10,809
ability to quickly develop concepts and

274
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:14,740
demonstrators due to their fresh out of

275
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:17,138
the box thinking we need a common soul

276
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,459
civil military understanding of cyber

277
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:26,789
and its implication on every aspect of

278
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:30,159
our life finally we need the ability and

279
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:33,519
well doing for industry to take our

280
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:36,960
concepts forward and industrialize them

281
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,130
into capabilities for our war fighters

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,650
all of it

283
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,770
without losing the perspective on the

284
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:48,460
Alliance collective needs in

285
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,980
interoperability and Federation if you

286
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,270
prepare for the next war your

287
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:58,330
preparations are always based on the

288
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,330
experiences of the last one but we have

289
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,980
to cut the ties to this rule because

290
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,659
there has not been any war and conflict

291
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:11,860
conducted with the means that we are

292
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,950
facing today the closer look to on

293
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,399
estonia's forward thinking way on how

294
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,980
they introduced and managed the digital

295
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,300
civil administration of the whole

296
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:27,750
country is outstanding the ability to

297
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,510
ensure safe networks and provides

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:34,420
state-of-the-art data projection is an

299
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:38,260
impressive indicator for the way ahead

300
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:42,100
of us because the future that has

301
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,250
already begun this future is challenging

302
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,429
and there will be always a resistance

303
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:54,130
and prejudice towards innovative

304
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:56,890
thinking and solutions but we don't have

305
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:01,819
a choice

306
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,819
