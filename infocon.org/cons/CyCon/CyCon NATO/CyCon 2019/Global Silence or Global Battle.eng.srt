1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
thank you to CCDC OE with entrusting me

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,459
there's a really great panel so this is

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,139
the after lunch conversation the after

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,790
lunch conversation and before the

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,518
cocktail hour conversations are the most

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,439
challenging so to keep you all focus

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,270
today there's gonna be a little quiz at

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,609
the end to make sure you win all paying

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,830
attention that is just a joke but let's

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,240
start with a little poll so how many of

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,639
you in the room believe that we this

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,679
global silence this constant engagement

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,260
we're seeing is going to continue like

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
it is now this forever war that some of

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,760
our are talking about who thinks it's

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,160
going to stay like this who things we

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,849
are leading towards escalation and that

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,019
we're going to see more state-on-state

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,760
non-state actors two state actors

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,289
attacks and that it's things situations

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,589
will just get worse right I will see if

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,930
you will you will have the same opinion

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,449
at the end of the panel so we have we

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,339
have a three speakers today and and that

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,789
as much as I mentioned that the title is

26
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,500
global silence or global battle so we've

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,330
been asked or the speakers have been

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,659
asked to talk a little bit about who are

29
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,310
the new entrants in this space or what

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,720
are some of the new tactics and

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,680
techniques of the old and known actors

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,229
but we're also going to talk a little

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,259
bit about what the diffusion of power is

34
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,939
doing to the concept of the Terran so we

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,530
have three speakers we'll do things a

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,360
little differently than the other panels

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,430
we've seen each of the speaker will

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,320
present separately for about 20 minutes

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,210
because they had their presenting on

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,119
different regions and different

41
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,149
countries and then we will go to to a

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,600
Q&A so our first speaker today is the

43
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,640
first lieutenant miss Kong who is the

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,949
Korean who works at the Korean Air Force

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,810
but she's also active at the Department

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,920
of information security at Korean

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,200
University so she will share with us the

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,850
analysis she and her colleagues have

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,369
done on North Korean operations and

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,728
strategies I think given how little we

51
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,770
know about North Korean the way they

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,200
organize their cyber forces their

53
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,069
strategies she'll shed some light on the

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,219
recent operation

55
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,719
and what they what they can mean for for

56
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:29,370
the alliance so with that the floor is

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:32,099
yours thank you okay so hello I would

58
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,319
like to thank NATO and cCTC OE for

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,810
inviting me to saikhan and I'm truly

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,939
honored to be here today and before I

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,310
start my presentation I would like to

62
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,459
inform that all the views thoughts and

63
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,069
opinions made in my presentation do not

64
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,950
represent the official position of

65
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:53,488
Republic of Korea nor the ROK Ministry

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:58,138
of National Defense and okay so let's

67
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,730
begin so this is the table of contents

68
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,280
and I would like to start the brief

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,340
introduction of North Korea's interest

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:10,829
in cyber capabilities so the interest of

71
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,590
North Korea's cyber interest in the

72
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,290
cyber warfare have predated from the

73
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,329
beginning of the Kim jong-un's regime

74
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,010
who is the current leader of North Korea

75
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:27,329
right now Kim jong-il the formal Korean

76
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,120
North Korean leader he have he have

77
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:33,209
perceived the advantage of having

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,199
networked military by monitoring the

79
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,760
Gulf or the Kosovo war and the Iraq war

80
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:43,680
he have strengthened his

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,629
built the sorry $2 he has strengthened

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,540
the importance of building the cyber

83
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:51,000
capabilities by stress stretching out

84
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,840
that in the electronic warfare reference

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,269
guide in 2005 saying that a modern war

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,260
is decided by one's conduct of

87
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,409
electronic warfare

88
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:05,370
thus cyber units are my detached force

89
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:07,620
and detached backup power based on his

90
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,280
father's work Kim jong-un the current

91
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,949
leader of North Korea also stressed on

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,988
building the cyber capabilities in North

93
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:21,180
Korea his major what his major in his

94
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,429
major is computer science and the

95
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,460
military so he knows the importance as

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,110
well and he have stated when he visited

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,568
the cyber units

98
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,000
reconnaissance general Bureau which is

99
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:36,569
the key cyber unit in North Korea in

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,780
2000 in February 2013 he have stated

101
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,090
that with intensive information and

102
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,150
communication technology and the brave

103
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,729
RGB with its cyber warriors we can

104
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,859
penetrate and sanctions any sanctions

105
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:54,120
for the construction of a strong and

106
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,810
prosperous nation likewise despite of

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,759
the of North Korea's weak environment

108
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,789
North Korea the upper leadership of

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
North Korea have put continuous interest

110
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,800
and effort to build these cyber

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,919
capabilities in that sense they have

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,740
sent 50 to 60 elite soldiers and nearly

113
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,090
to abroad to study computer science and

114
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,270
then when they come back to North Korea

115
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:23,758
they work as the cyberattack attackers

116
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:28,680
in cyber units and then so therefore

117
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:32,750
their estimated 6000 and 800 estimated

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,750
cyber soldiers in North Korea currently

119
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,370
therefore cyber warfare is an optimal

120
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,699
choice for North Korea due to the

121
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,159
following costs and effects cyber

122
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,930
warfare ensures continuous effects

123
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,930
during wartime and peacetime

124
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,319
in covert and LOC low cost cyber

125
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,180
operations achieve various missions from

126
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,370
the upper leadership of North Korea and

127
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,370
moreover they have really limited

128
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,099
Internet dependency because of the

129
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,560
because of the Kim's Kim's thought that

130
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:09,180
open information would harm his regime

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,129
so North Korea has nothing to like it's

132
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:17,129
hard to get into their systems so this

133
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,710
picture is the military unit of a

134
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:22,500
military command structure in North

135
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,758
Korea and I would like to say that the

136
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,550
shaded units are direct or possibly

137
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,650
relevant to cyber operations so on the

138
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,589
above Kim jong-un is over there the

139
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,870
current leader of North Korea and he

140
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,630
serves as the chairman of state affairs

141
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,610
Commission and supreme commander of

142
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,889
Korean People's Army

143
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,810
and also chairman of Central Military

144
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,379
Commission of Workers Party of Korea

145
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,300
which means he has the he is he

146
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,430
maintains the overall control and

147
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,949
comments of North Korean military

148
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,870
I would like to throughout this picture

149
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:04,110
I would like to mention that the cyber

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,419
units that there are relevant to cyber

151
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,729
operations are divided into two groups

152
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,639
the first is General Staff Department

153
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:14,699
and then the second is recognizance

154
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,509
general Beru General Staff Department is

155
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,990
under the Korean People's Army and they

156
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:24,960
conduct cyber operations within their

157
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,569
conventional military capabilities while

158
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,049
a recognizance General Peru acquires

159
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:32,699
tests and reports directly to the upper

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,310
leadership of the state affairs

161
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,889
commission which means the leader Kim

162
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,949
and then it means that the direct

163
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,259
relation and direct reporting system

164
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:51,629
shows the strategic importance of

165
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:53,940
recognizance General Peru so let's move

166
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:58,699
on to the cyber operations attributed to

167
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,990
North Korea in in our paper we have

168
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,349
categorized the cyber operations

169
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,089
attributed to North Korea into three

170
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,669
objectives first this information

171
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,529
espionage secondly cyber terrorism and

172
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:15,479
then financial warfare finest are the

173
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,759
categories may not be exclusive so may

174
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,628
be an operation can fall into more than

175
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,009
two categories financial warfare

176
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:25,770
differentiates the state-sponsored

177
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:28,800
actors of North Korea to those of other

178
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,930
nations things because generally

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,399
state-sponsored actors focus on the

180
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,510
first two objectives the espionage the

181
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,750
information as peonage and cyber

182
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,208
terrorism and criminal groups focus on

183
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,420
gaining the financial gains however

184
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:49,140
North Korean cyber forces conduct

185
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,990
operations of financial warfare due to

186
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,199
the international sanctions I will go on

187
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,180
later so I'll due to the time limit

188
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,910
station I will not go over all the

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,609
operations discussed in my paper but I

190
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,189
will just briefly go on the operations

191
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:09,900
that have significant meaning for

192
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,600
today's talk for information espionage

193
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,600
operation I would like to talk about the

194
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,300
campaign game suki campaign game suki is

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,300
the most representative information

196
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,459
espionage activity that is attributed to

197
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,560
north korea the reason why I put

198
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,010
campaign instead of operation as a

199
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,589
campaign stands for the stains for a

200
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,710
series of military operations to achieve

201
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:37,290
a goal in this case North Korea is

202
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,960
targeting South Korean government South

203
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,349
Korean government agencies military or

204
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,990
defense industrial base to get to

205
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,970
collect intelligence of national defense

206
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:55,230
Foreign Affairs and other secret

207
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,220
information the funny are this

208
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,130
statistics

209
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,910
it shows the newly discovered malware

210
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,810
code every month by the attackers who

211
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,390
have first created the malware Kim Suki

212
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,140
the interesting point is that the

213
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,990
espionage activities go it's still

214
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,060
ongoing and it's going up and up so the

215
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,140
activity is more active right now and

216
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:25,560
the more important thing is that the

217
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:28,890
number of the number of newly discovered

218
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,300
malware increases substantially before

219
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:35,880
and after the key political events so in

220
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,010
here you can see that after the

221
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,610
breakdown of the second u.s. and North

222
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,810
Korean hano estimate the number of

223
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:48,120
discovered malware have been the highest

224
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:51,209
I would like to go over to the cyber

225
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,520
terrorism operations it's about the

226
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,580
operation blockbuster many of you have

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,319
been known about this operation almost

228
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:03,780
on november 24th 2014

229
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,240
almost half of personal computers and

230
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,829
servers have been wiped out by a cyber

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,980
attack caused by

232
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:19,720
on Tiger coat guardians of peace not the

233
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:22,540
galaxy's yes and then so the US

234
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,300
officials have announced that it it was

235
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,689
retribute the operation was retribute it

236
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,760
by the upcoming Sony movie called the

237
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,510
interview which has the plot of

238
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:38,560
assassinating the leader came at that

239
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:41,920
time President Obama has warned that the

240
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,069
United States will launch a proportional

241
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,910
response to the attack of some attack

242
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,630
against Sony just a few days later in

243
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,630
North Korea

244
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,650
all the internal have been went to

245
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,420
completely dark

246
00:11:53,650 --> 00:12:00,939
I mean offline whether the United States

247
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,229
have conducted that oh and then the

248
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:08,140
internet um block sorry internet went

249
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,040
dark and it is assumed that there was a

250
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,560
DDoS attack that has caused the blackout

251
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,180
it is not clear that whether the United

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,989
States have conducted ddos attack

253
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,719
against North Korea but the Sony hack

254
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,900
the operation blockbuster still shows an

255
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,700
important sign that a state-sponsored

256
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:33,610
actor can still attack a private firm

257
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,130
which is sunny in this case and I would

258
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,120
like to move on to the our last category

259
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,210
the financial warfare international

260
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,260
sanctions have been put pushed to Kim's

261
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,660
regime to conduct operations at cyber

262
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,840
operations to generate their income for

263
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,130
their their regime operation and wanna

264
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,920
cry Bangladesh is central haste and

265
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:04,480
cryptocurrencies theft or exemplify the

266
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,620
operations of financial warfare on May

267
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,630
12 2007 teen wanna cry ransomware have

268
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:15,400
infected more than three hundred

269
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,250
thousand machines and then the

270
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,890
widespread the widespread of one wanna

271
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:25,810
cry show demonstrates the fact that

272
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:28,069
one wore mobile malware is very

273
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,829
spreading and then it has the power to

274
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:35,710
spread out by replicating itself to

275
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:39,290
over-consume compromised the systems

276
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:44,180
Bangladesh central bank aced happened in

277
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:46,730
February 2016 and it show North Korean

278
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:53,270
the state-sponsored actor of North Korea

279
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:57,520
have abused Swift Network 250 Network

280
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,560
they have stoled with the stolen Swift

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,850
credentials they made several fradulent

282
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:08,979
transactions and one has succeeded which

283
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:11,750
made to the 81 million u.s. dollars

284
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:17,290
transaction from Bangladesh central bank

285
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:20,540
to whatever to the to the regime yes and

286
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:24,140
according to the recent UN panel of

287
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:27,790
experts report that was in March 2019

288
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,720
and it says that North Korea has amassed

289
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:37,870
600 around 670 million u.s. dollars in

290
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,870
foreign and cryptocurrencies since 2016

291
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:46,430
so after going on to the on cyber

292
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:50,869
operations I would like to ask Ben what

293
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:53,709
will be the next or current the military

294
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:57,200
strategy for North Korean cyber forces I

295
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:00,110
believe that they will develop their

296
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,960
cyber operations in more strategic forms

297
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:07,420
by choosing their targets with more

298
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:10,220
consideration and more creativeness

299
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,589
moreover they would like to mix their

300
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,590
tactics techniques and procedures it

301
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:19,540
appears in short with other countries to

302
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,820
make their attribution more difficult I

303
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,089
will just briefly explain about the

304
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,900
TTP's tactics techniques and procedures

305
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:32,990
mean the behavior or a modus operandi of

306
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,750
cyber adversaries TTP's helped to

307
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,360
highlight the Prudential information

308
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,139
in cyber operations and define attack

309
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,569
Ursus attributes such as attack vectors

310
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:47,500
scenarios and identities this is why

311
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:50,389
every like security cyber security

312
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,829
analysis tried to find the TTP's when

313
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:57,399
they discover new malware so how do they

314
00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:00,500
make study t-piece with other countries

315
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,259
North Korea is mixing TTP's with other

316
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,509
countries by sending their cyber forces

317
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:08,480
to the countries and there are two

318
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,500
methods that they can deal with this the

319
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,360
first involves conducting operational

320
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,120
operations based on preset coordination

321
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,500
through diplomatic military and

322
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,569
political channels for example China

323
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,240
there are have been many continuous

324
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:29,389
reports the North Korea have been

325
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,970
sending their troops to China and under

326
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,639
the shadow of China are conducting the

327
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:38,660
operations that there are North Korea

328
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,879
can avoid make the attribution more

329
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,329
difficult and moreover when they are

330
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,980
attributed they can avoid the diplomatic

331
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:52,939
issues since the because of the

332
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:56,329
jurisdiction problems in fact the

333
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:59,589
Chinese embassy in Washington DC have

334
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:02,959
been refused to answer the questions of

335
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:06,319
whether China is supporting the North

336
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,339
Korean cyber operations I would like to

337
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:13,490
also add another example to this this

338
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:16,609
method that Iran also has the connection

339
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:21,230
with North Korea they had the technology

340
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:28,099
sharing thread v3t since 2012 and it was

341
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:32,690
focused on the cyber spear Iran based on

342
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:36,080
the treaty they had a sharing share the

343
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:40,490
treaty technology sharing corporations

344
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,689
on cyber experiences on cyber warfare

345
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:47,510
and also their TTP's several security

346
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,929
analysis have said that the operation

347
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,440
Shamoon which

348
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:56,490
said to be iran-backed case they have

349
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:01,639
found the similar cyber a similar TT

350
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:04,019
piece and also the same commercially

351
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:06,990
sorry commercially um

352
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,769
driver files that have been used in

353
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,049
operation blockbuster of North Korea

354
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:15,289
the second method involves dispatching

355
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,700
cyber forces and conducting operations

356
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:20,970
without the target countries

357
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,629
acknowledgment according to the recorded

358
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,970
future in 2018 ten nations were

359
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:29,610
identified in which North Koreans

360
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,610
maintains an actual physical presence

361
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:38,939
and virtual prisons the Tang countries

362
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:44,248
include Bangladesh Thailand Malaysia New

363
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:46,080
Zealand Mozambique Kenya and India and

364
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,909
China and so on you can look at the

365
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,740
report if you want to know the rest of

366
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:55,350
the countries and then yes further

further details about the preset

369
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:03,210
coordination between North Korea and

370
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,149
other countries are discussed in my

371
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:09,149

talk a little bit about what is the

387
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,830
threat landscape in asia-pacific and

388
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,990
what the Japanese government and the

389
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,360
private sector are doing about it so

390

with that the floor is yours thank you

391
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,449
so hello so thank you for your time and

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,110
I'm really appreciative that in the NATO

393
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:14,260
CCDC OE and Estonian teams are giving us

394
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,439
a great opportunity and also hospitality

395
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:23,050
and thank you Vincent to organize this

396
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:26,290
and so today I'd like to share the

397
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:29,080
threats and risks happening in the

398
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:33,250
asia-pacific region but I also want to

399
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,899
be optimistic and I all want to talk

400
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:41,020
about the opportunities for

401
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:44,470
collaboration in asia-pacific so I'd

402
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,260
like to expand the scope of cyber risks

403
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,240
and the cyber attacks beyond North Korea

404
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,440
so Jiyeon just gave us a wonderful

405
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,809
presentation about espionage our

406
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,760
financially motivated crimes and

407
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:02,678
destruction such as wanna cry and we see

408
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,809
so many problems in the asia-pacific

409
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:10,980
region unfortunately but because I'm

410
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:13,750
from industry I also want to talk about

411
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,940
the risks happening critical

412
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,910
infrastructure sectors because I'm from

413
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,520
the telecom company and also know how

414
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:24,370
big companies and also government and

415
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:30,220
academia can help the small and

416
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:31,729
medium-sized enterprises so for example

417
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,659
hacktivism

418
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,110
so India Pakistan have been having the

419
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:42,950
geopolitical tension over Kashmir over

420
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:47,649
last decades and unfortunately this

421
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:52,659
tension also exists in cyberspace and

422
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:55,219
which started to happen around 2000 and

423
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:59,360
hacktivism and website defacement

424
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:03,860
occurred over Kashmir but this

425
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,129
hacktivism researched around 2000 when a

426
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:11,570
coordinated bombing and shooting what

427
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:14,799
happened in Mumbai and every year on the

428
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,980
anniversary of Mumbai terror attacks

429
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:23,179
defacement activities happen from Indian

430
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,909
hackers against Pakistani websites and

431
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:29,720
this is not only about website

432
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:33,639
defacement or hacktivism they started to

433
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,970
take advantage of new tools social media

434
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:42,049
so the Kashmir attention went up again

435
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:45,559
in February 2000 19 when the suicide

436
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:48,379
bombing by car happened in the into

437
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:53,840
India controlled part of Kashmir and the

438
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:57,429
social media feeds started to emerge to

439
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:01,129
claim that also this capture of Indian

440
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:05,389
fighter pilot is a fake or this is to

441
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:08,720
something right out and this kind of

442
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:13,340
disinformation campaign doesn't exist

443
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:17,059
only in Pakistan or India so I talked

444
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:21,279
about two cases of Chinese

445
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:26,928
disinformation campaign against Taiwan

446
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:32,299
so a huge typhoon called a JB hit Japan

447
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,940
last year and it especially hit hard the

448
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,370
western part of Japan and also a

449
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:41,929
diarrhea I'm not sure how many of you

450
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:45,739
have been to my country and so after

451
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:50,570
that the serious flooding and a pan

452
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:54,320
smashed into the corridor of the Kansai

453
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,629
Airport which is located in the western

454
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,720
part of Japan

455
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:03,289
five thousand passengers and airport

456
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,539
workers got stranded in the airport and

457
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:11,750
can you imagine five thousand people

458
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:14,360
start had to spend the night in there on

459
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:19,640
a foreign country and five thousand

460
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:25,279
people included 750 Chinese passengers

461
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:28,370
and also 500 Taiwanese tourists and then

462
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,679
the first component of this information

463
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,918
campaign started to emerge so what

464
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:37,159
happened so social media started to say

465
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:41,419
that oh the Chinese embassy in Japan

466
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:43,760
sent 15 buses to pick up the stranded

467
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:47,120
Chinese passengers from the airport to

468
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,129
the city area and then the second

469
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,979
component of the campaign started to

470
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,570
emerge the unica Oh so the Chinese

471
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,640
passengers on those five 15 buses

472
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,389
started to date Taiwanese to get on

473
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,559
board

474
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:09,740
only if Taiwanese declare their actually

475
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:15,379
Chinese however both of them proved fake

476
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:19,309
and inaccurate days after however it was

477
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:22,190
too late why because it's social media

478
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:25,850
people tweet about it on people D post

479
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:29,149
over and over again and it was picked by

480
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:32,090
not only the social media but also the

481
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:35,149
Chinese state-owned media outlets and

482
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:39,110
also unfortunately Taiwanese media

483
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:42,260
outlets and can you imagine a huge

484
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,928
amount of criticism emerged against

485
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,789
Taiwanese government and also a

486
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,799
Taiwanese version of the embassy in

487
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:54,020
Japan and called economic and cultural

488
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:56,510
office they criticized also the Chinese

489
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,399
government is helping their citizens so

490
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,190
how can Taiwanese government is not

491
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,739
doing that

492
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:07,100
even though that the it was based upon a

493
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:09,510
fake crane and then tragedy happened

494
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,740
taiwanese diplomat who was the

495
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,020
director-general

496
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,840
the osaka branch of the economic and

497
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:20,670
cultural office committed suicide

498
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,669
and he left the note saying that he is

499
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:26,850
he has been really troubled by the huge

500
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:31,650
criticism and coming to the Taiwanese

501
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:35,100
government and his office and this year

502
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,080
three are two months ago that the

503
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,080
organization called our reporters

504
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,710
without borders published report about

505
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,419
chinese disinformation campaign and

506
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,960
during the press conference they

507
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:54,240
referred to this tragedy and also the

508
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:57,930
suicide and chinese disinformation

509
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,320
campaign didn't stop there so the

510
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:04,650
taiwanese had a series of municipal

511
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:08,340
campaigns and elections last november

512
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:12,720
and then the fourth taiwanese foreign

513
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:15,030
minister joseph raised his concern he

514
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,880
said that well this information and

515
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,389
election interference have been

516
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,870
happening from the chinese over the

517
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:29,640
years and years but it started to take a

518
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:33,449
new form using the social media and sure

519
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:38,880
enough they use the social media and

520
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:45,150
also that online britain post to send

521
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:50,820
out this information so can you see this

522
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,970
followed so it's a bit small but so ten

523
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,929
you see that notice also he is a DPP

524
00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:03,290
candidate before running for this city's

525
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:06,420
mayor and so this photo is actually fake

526
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:09,629
photoshopped but he's he looks like a

527
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,070
wearing an earpiece so the social media

528
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:15,340
and the online readings

529
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:18,250
fees study the Kramer's oh he's actually

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:22,929
wearing an earpiece to get a real-time

531
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:26,380
fist to answer his tough questions over

532
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:30,640
political promises are held by the

533
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:33,520
Taiwanese TV programs but it was all

534
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,220
fake but it was tweeted and be posted

535
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:47,350
over and over again so it kind of eroded

536
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:50,020
his confidence and of course each and

537
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:56,530
this election led to the huge loss to

538
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:58,990
DPP and huge victory to the KMT and the

539
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,840
huge concern over this information

540
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:05,320
campaign the not one that happened in

541
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,260
Taiwan but also in the United States so

542
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,990
six US senators for three from Democrats

543
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:16,540
and three from Republicans sent open

544
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:18,520
letter to FBI director DNI director our

545
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,100
Secretary of State upon bail on

546
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,610
Secretary of Treasury of Nugent to say

547
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,990
that oh so we should actually

548
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:29,229
investigate and help the Taiwanese

549
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,900
friends are the not to address the

550
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,480
concerns or over allegation that the

551
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,400
Chinese Communist Party in the field

552
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:44,290
that the Taiwanese elections because

553
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:47,380
they are partner and North Korea is also

554
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:49,240
another our concern in the asia-pacific

555
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,210
region and beyond

556
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,400
so as Dion mentioned they are working on

557
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:01,510
financially motivated crimes and also

558
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:06,910
not only that our distractions to this

559
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:09,370
business continuity so it's not only to

560
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:14,980
the concerns to the government but also

561
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:18,120
the business because wanna cry created a

562
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,770
so many problems and we just continued

563
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,919
continuity so industry started to

564
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,740
rethink that especially because nowadays

565
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,410
we have to

566
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,710
on global supply chains and global

567
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,290
partners outside the national borders so

568
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,120
they have to rethink unleash shape the

569
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:40,010
cybersecurity strategy and the

570
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,580
deterrence and resiliency and speaking

571
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:45,679
of critical infrastructure protection

572
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,580
the environment we are sitting in are

573
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,000
getting tougher and tougher so we see so

574
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:56,350
many cyber attacks we also see more

575
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,980
regulations and trade change to trade

576
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,409
tensions but despite of that critical

577
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,380
infrastructure companies are responsible

578
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,410
to provide 24/7 our services to

579
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,320
customers because it's a foundation of

580
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,840
social welfare economic growth and

581
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,689
national security

582
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,669
so that is why cyber security physical

583
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,960
security sectors specific and also

584
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,510
cross-sectoral and public-private

585
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,050
partnerships are getting more important

586
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:35,450
to continue to provide good services to

587
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:36,950
customers but cyberattacks and not only

588
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,830
the headaches to the critical

589
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:42,440
infrastructure companies so it can be

590
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:45,710
system failures because they happen

591
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:50,290
unfortunately and also natural disasters

592
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:54,800
like typhoons as I mentioned and also

593
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:57,559
flooding or earthquakes and sometimes it

594
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,370
is easy to distinguish all this cause

595
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:03,470
and this calls coming from cyber tech or

596
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,250
the system failure right away and

597
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:11,210
sometimes not so in our case at NTT

598
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:15,440
cooperation we use network operations

599
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,230
center in TT cert cyber security team

600
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,440
and disaster management team to work

601
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:25,400
together to eliminate any potential

602
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,580
element of course one by one and to do

603
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,010
that we also have to have a good

604
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:34,340
consistent communication risk management

605
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:37,040
and also joint exercises not within NTT

606
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,279
but also with other companies and

607
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,460
government

608
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,789
why because critical infrastructure have

609
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,159
interdependency to each other

610
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:51,270
telecommunication depends on electricity

611
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,299
or energy and we also have to rely on

612
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:57,129
transportation so that is why the

613
00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:00,429
Japanese government has been doing a

614
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:03,340
fantastic job to have an annual joint

615
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,649
exercise not only between the central

616
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,129
government but also with different

617
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:13,229
critical sexual sectors every year and

618
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:21,399
the last one happened in Tokyo last

619
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:25,720
December so this photo is from from the

620
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:29,590
last December's exercise and we actually

621
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,710
had 3000 participants from the

622
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,289
government and also from every sector of

623
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:39,130
the 14 critical infrastructure sectors

624
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:43,169
and they tested multifaceted cyber

625
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:46,149
stress so cyber attacks - electric grid

626
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:49,090
transportation and they also added a new

627
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:56,799
element are this information expansion

628
00:33:49,090 --> 00:34:00,039
by social media and but we also have to

629
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,408
include small and medium-sized companies

630
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:06,000
into our cyber security or risk

631
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:08,619
management discussions because their

632
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,089
fundamental part of our supply chains

633
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:15,700
and economic growth on national security

634
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:19,000
however because they are so small they

635
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:23,290
don't enough resources manpower or

636
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,580
budget so that is why the bad guys

637
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:31,750
exactly know what they should be after

638
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,168
so 60% and 43% of cyber attacks target

639
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,399
small and medium sized companies and

640
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:42,940
unfortunately 60% of small companies

641
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:46,388
attacked go out of business within six

642
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,460
months so we should do something about

643
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,410
it

644
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,380
and this is a duty problematic

645
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:59,089
especially in the asia-pacific region

646
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:01,250
because 90% of the companies exist in in

647
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:10,070
the region are small or medium sized

648
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:11,600
companies so but what exactly what kind

649
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,960
of problem actually the small and

650
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,970
medium-sized companies have so this is

651
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,570
statistics taken from western part of

652
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:23,600
Japan called Osaka so according to their

653
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:26,570
survey two years ago the small and

654
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,650
medium-sized companies have only five

655
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:34,820
thousand US dollars to use annually for

656
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:37,940
cyber security and five thousand US

657
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:41,510
dollars are not that much to spend on

658
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:45,470
cyber security so good news is the most

659
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:48,740
of them have antivirus software but not

660
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:52,930
know more than that and most of them

661
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:56,299
don't have passed even passwords or even

662
00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:01,000
encryption so not so much data security

663
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:07,220
covered for small medium-sized companies

664
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:10,030
so what should we do with it so that

665
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:13,430
most Japanese are big companies and

666
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,430
Japanese government started to take more

667
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,379
efforts and our actions to take for

668
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,629
small and medium-sized companies and

669
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:25,160
also for the protection of a critical

670
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:28,760
infrastructure why because now we have a

671
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:32,390
clear deadline on the cria go to the

672
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,600
more successful in cyber security so six

673
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,330
years ago the Tokyo was selected to host

674
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,410
the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic

675
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:44,930
Games and this is a huge sports event

676
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,180
and everybody gets excited about but

677
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,970
it's more than sports because it can be

678
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,279
also political it can be also diplomacy

679
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,799
and it also about national security and

680
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,370
it showcases and technology level

681
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,780
including cyber security so it dearly

682
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,930
prompted not only the Japanese

683
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,020
but Japanese industry and Japanese

684
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:10,970
academia to work together across and in

685
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,820
the organizational silos to create more

686
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:18,240
information sharing on cyber threats so

687
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,400
gene said that North Korea and Iran are

688
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,720
working together to share their

689
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,420
knowledge and if bad guys can do that

690
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,720
good people should do that to be better

691
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:33,870
because we need collective knowledge to

692
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,740
the better in terms of cybersecurity and

693
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:42,839
the Japanese major companies created a

694
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:48,569
forum code across sector forum to create

695
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:51,240
a great ecosystem to educate hire train

696
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:54,300
and retain cybersecurity professionals

697
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,259
in cooperation with Japanese government

698
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:01,470
and Japanese academia because we need

699
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:04,770
more good cybersecurity people in this

700
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:07,640
field and it's not only for Olympic

701
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:10,320
Games but only also to live a positive

702
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:14,930
cybersecurity legacy for the next

703
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:18,780
generations we have more cyber exercises

704
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:22,020
joint exercises or internal exercises

705
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,180
and another to be more successful and to

706
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:27,990
be better at cybersecurity and the

707
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,480
Japanese government is also helping the

708
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:35,850
small and medium-sized companies and

709
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,520
also IOT to to be more resilient and

710
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:43,620
until increase or deterrence in the

711
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:47,070
cyber space so if we have a create

712
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:52,009
vision on Korea go and clear dead wrong

713
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:57,090
we can be more successful and you have a

714
00:38:52,010 --> 00:39:00,480
good case in Europe too because some

715
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:03,690
Olympic Games is coming up in Paris in

716
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,810
five years and also in the United States

717
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:11,310
and Los Angeles is hosting the Summer

718
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:13,950
Olympic Games in 2012 and actually the

719
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:16,308
the Los Angeles started to fall

720
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,450
cyber threat intelligence framework

721
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:22,319
including the small and medium-sized

722
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,480
companies and before this session I was

723
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:27,058
having a small chat with Clara and she

724
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,520
told me that and how organisation is and

725
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:32,790
making a toolkit for small and

726
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,160
medium-sized companies cyber security so

727
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,250
I think that is that this saikhan

728
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,670
conference is a great platform because

729
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,920
we are all from like-minded countries we

730
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,319
are from different sector different

731
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,510
company different government different

732
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:51,660
universities or think tank but we have

733
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:54,359
the shared goal to have a better

734
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,200
cybersecurity not only for their own

735
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:01,049
organization but also for our team the

736
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,980
global teams to be better so ideally

737
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:07,829
appreciate NATO CCDC OE and Vincent to

738
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:14,849
give me this opportunity thank you thank

739
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:18,210
you and also thank you for the great

740
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:21,420
plug for the global cyber alliance so

741
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:24,380
last but not least is kaki know who is

742
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,430
the senior director at fireEye

743
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,440
cocoon has a long career in the private

744
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,839
sector but he's done and probably equal

745
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,609
if not more work thinking about the

746
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,440
international law deterrence and

747
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,690
everything in between so he'll talk a

748
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,339
little bit about the diffusion of power

749
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,750
and how we can deal with the Terrans

750
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:44,630
with this diffuse power so with that

751
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,130
thank you Thank You Clara

752
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:52,710
good afternoon hey it's a pleasure to be

753
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,750
here it's both an honor and pleasure to

754
00:40:52,710 --> 00:41:01,890
be here especially I'm the only man in

755
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:04,410
the panel so today I'm gonna be talking

756
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,069
about the row of legitimacy in

757
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:11,220
deterrence framework right so ten years

758
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:14,089
ago I took some time off from my

759
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,589
full-time job and I went to do

760
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:18,779
counterterrorism research and one of the

761
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:21,839
things that I wanted to do was to look

762
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,750
at you know violence profile basically I

763
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,049
wanted to know what drives terrorist

764
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,490
groups right and one of the key group

765
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,040
that I looked at was this group called

766
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,529
al-shabaab al-shabaab if you are not

767
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,080
familiar with them they're based out of

768
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:41,030
East Africa so countries like Ethiopia

769
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,970
Somalia in Kenya and they are closely

770
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,590
affiliated with al-qaeda and you

771
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,319
probably have heard of you know

772
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:51,710
al-shabaab with this terrorist incident

773
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,900
is basically massacre and in the mall a

774
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:58,880
shopping mall called Westgate back in

775
00:41:53,900 --> 00:42:01,610
2013 71 people died in that incident and

776
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,700
more than 200 people were injured and

777
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:07,610
many of whom were critically injured so

778
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,879
I was actually in Nairobi a week plus

779
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,940
after the incident and I met what you

780
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,890
know people who over the past one week

781
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:18,170
who had to attend six seven eight

782
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,900
funerals because you know they had a

783
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,450
friend their neighbor their family who

784
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,760
died in that particular incident so the

785
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:29,210
amount of grief the amount of sadness

786
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,360
the amount of pain totally shocked me it

787
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,720
shocked me to the core and you know when

788
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,880
it comes to violence profile you know

789
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,740
it's very hard to ideally you want to

790
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,810
interview terrorists you want to get out

791
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,910
Shabaab in the room with you and say you

792
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,460
know what drives you right and that's

793
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:48,170
presumably is gonna be difficult even if

794
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,910
I were to be able to do that I probably

795
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,430
won't be here standing and talking to

796
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,200
you about that so what's the alternative

797
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,330
the alternative is really about you know

798
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,580
look at what they put out there right so

799
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:01,549
they put out a lot of Twitter messages

800
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,590
so what I did was basically I took all

801
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:06,290
these Twitter messages thousands of

802
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,870
messages and I meticulously look into

803
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,550
all these messages and I basically find

804
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,040
that you can actually group these

805
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:16,250
messages most of them into three buckets

806
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,190
three main drivers the first driver here

807
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:21,530
is called legitimacy that is to say you

808
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,930
know where do they derive legitimacy

809
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,910
from so if you look into these tweeted

810
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:29,029
messages they basically look at and say

811
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,660
well they derived legitimacy from God or

812
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:35,990
Allah okay because Allah is with us okay

813
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,200
the second driver there is needs and

814
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,368
these really talk to live needs that

815
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,739
provision

816
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:46,029
and oppression and the way they

817
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:48,650
articulate this is that they talk about

818
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:51,829
indiscriminate killing by the Kenyan

819
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:54,650
Defense Forces they talk about women and

820
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:57,349
children suffering and yes they also

821
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:00,589
talk about Western colonization the

822
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:03,289
continuation of Western colonization the

823
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:05,779
last driver that I found was this thing

824
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:08,420
called confidence right where do they

825
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:10,069
derive confidence from and you know

826
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,859
there are two parts to that the first

827
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:15,079
part is really about you know

828
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:18,319
operational success that is they have

829
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:21,170
the capability to inflict death and

830
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,869
injury do government forces okay and

831
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,150
that gives them a lot of confidence the

832
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:28,999
second part of that is really about you

833
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,210
know dehumanization of Kenyan defense

834
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:35,029
forces you know you know you see a lot

835
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:39,349
taunting going on right there right so

836
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:42,799
these three variables legitimacy need

837
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:45,109
and confidence they actually you know

838
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:46,609
pretty well research and I've included a

839
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:48,589
couple of sources that you see on the

840
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:50,569
bottom right-hand side here but what I

841
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:53,869
wanna do is talk a little bit about the

842
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:55,579
interrelationship right the bad news is

843
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:58,039
that if you look at this picture here

844
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:01,099
the bad news for us is that you know

845
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:03,140
they are mutually reinforcing okay a

846
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,809
nice to say that you know if I am

847
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,660
successful in killing government forces

848
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:11,239
and you know that gives me not only a

849
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:13,578
lot of confidence but essentially what

850
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,460
that tells me also is that well God is

851
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:18,559
on my side right and if God is on my

852
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,890
side then what should i do I should

853
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,529
continue to fight oppression and with

854
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:27,009
that I need more capabilities I need

855
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:30,229
more weapons so you can see that is

856
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:32,660
reinforcing mutually reinforcing the

857
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:35,149
good news is also that is also mutually

858
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,799
reinforcing and that is to say that you

859
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:40,160
know if you hit one of these three

860
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:43,099
variables you essentially could disrupt

861
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,069
them right so give you example so if I

862
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:49,549
have let's say full legitimacy God is on

863
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:52,339
my side I have you know the need the

864
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:54,570
required need that I need to address but

865
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:56,610
if you hit me on my

866
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,610
feeders that you if you take out my

867
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:01,230
capability I'm not gonna be better hit

868
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,150
you back right so you know you can

869
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,970
disrupt me or you can think about it

870
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:09,480
like that's - I have lots of confidence

871
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:12,750
I also have lots of needs but somehow

872
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,580
you undermine my thinking and you still

873
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,430
you tell me and I believe you now they

874
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,650
say well Allah is no more in my side

875
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:23,850
okay so the legitimacy is actually gone

876
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,010
and I would also not attack you right so

877
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:30,870
this is the good thing about this stuff

878
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:33,270
here right and so and so so what's

879
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:37,170
important to note what's important to

880
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,880
note is that these three drivers are

881
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,880
gonna be very key when we think about

882
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,040
you know cyber right so the lessons from

883
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,210
counterterrorism is such that you know

884
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,610
if you focus on attacking the actors on

885
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:53,790
the confidence part taking out their

886
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,620
capability what do you get you get quick

887
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,509
result you're absolutely gonna get quick

888
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,450
result but the problem with that is that

889
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:02,640
the result may not be very effective in

890
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,250
the long run and this is the lesson that

891
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,680
I bring with me to the cyber domain in

892
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:11,610
that I think there is going to be a

893
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,190
limit to what cyber offensive capability

894
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,740
can do for you it's very simple you hit

895
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,960
someone you hit someone hit a group they

896
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,180
can reconstitute they can regroup and

897
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,920
reconstitute if you're talking about

898
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,839
North Korea you probably don't have a

899
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,360
whole lot of target that you can look at

900
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:30,210
that's well okay the other thing is that

901
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,980
you know you may also feel escalation if

902
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,830
you are in an advanced country you're

903
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,450
very dependent on i.t and you have a lot

904
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,640
of attack surface here that you know

905
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,890
people can come back at you as you

906
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,230
attack them right so that's the

907
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,299
challenge right there now if you look at

908
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:49,950
the other two variables they're okay

909
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:53,940
legitimacy and mean they are slow at

910
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,020
work they may even be you know walking

911
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,250
indirectly

912
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:02,640
but potentially potentially they can be

913
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:04,350
more effective in the long run so in

914
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,529
this presentation I'm just gonna be

915
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,460
focusing on legitimacy right so one

916
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,210
source of legit

917
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:15,119
ceefor earth is yes international law

918
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:18,480
okay now with reference to the

919
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,460
deterrence framework I would argue that

920
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,460
you know you need at least two

921
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,180
preconditions before deterrence can work

922
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,450
properly

923
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,080
the first one is attribution that you

924
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:32,819
got to know who did what to you and why

925
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,940
that's the first thing second thing is

926
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:38,190
recognition of sovereignty that you have

927
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,050
to have recognition of sovereignty now

928
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,530
you don't have to take my word for this

929
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:46,680
okay especially now when sovereignty is

930
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:48,990
such a contentious topic all you have to

931
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,509
do is look at what's happening in the

932
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,729
South China Sea if I take you back to

933
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,230
the history of South China Sea right

934
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,330
after Second World War

935
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,400
none of these coastal states in the in

936
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:01,589
that you can see here none of them

937
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,349
actually make sovereignty claim over

938
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:08,299
these pieces of rocks and islands in the

939
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:10,380
South China Sea why why is that the case

940
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,980
because they will consider useless

941
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:16,890
worthless okay and it doesn't make sense

942
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,050
to commit national resources to defend

943
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:22,140
something that is considered worthless

944
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:25,859
or useless but things started to change

945
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:29,069
in the late 1960s the United Nation led

946
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:32,670
a survey of the South China Sea and what

947
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:36,030
did they find or reserve awesome all

948
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:39,900
reserve now I got oil in 1970 the

949
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:42,480
technology also developed in that you

950
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,730
know people can now drill for oil below

951
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,770
ocean depth level that's the second

952
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:51,660
thing I get now that's all I can get it

953
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:54,150
in 1973 the law also changed UN clause

954
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:56,580
came into effect in a nation Convention

955
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,160
and law of the sea which basically allow

956
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:02,940
or based in those states or coastal

957
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,670
states to form economic zones exclusive

958
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,640
economic zone so these three factors

959
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,650
this oil there's a way to get it there's

960
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,089
a law that allows me to build economic

961
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:17,190
zone basically made all the states here

962
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:20,880
make sovereignty claim over South China

963
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:22,350
Sea by far by far the most dominant

964
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,520
player right here

965
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:28,500
yes China okay and China basically if

966
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,630
you can see here called the nine dash

967
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,280
line this green line that you see here

968
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,350
China's basically stood making

969
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,290
sovereignty claim to say the entire

970
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,940
South China Sea belongs to us okay

971
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,650
in fact what China has been doing is

972
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,200
basically you know they're conquering

973
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,930
Islands they're building military and

974
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:51,689
also civilian infrastructure right there

975
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:53,160
right so today this is law or sea lines

976
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,000
of communication called the South China

977
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,080
Sea is of immense value it carries 30

978
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,900
percent of the world

979
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:05,009
crude oil three trillion dollars of

980
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,390
trade goes by every year okay lots of

981
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:08,970
fishes there you like scuba diving

982
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,029
there's 2,000 fishes there I'm trying to

983
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:14,220
get you to go to these places here okay

984
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:17,400
so food security is important and not to

985
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,890
mention lots of oil so ladies and

986
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,900
gentlemen this combination of immense

987
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:25,740
value immense value of the South China

988
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:28,530
Sea plus lack of sovereignty recognition

989
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:31,859
basically contribute to this domain

990
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:36,540
being one of the highly contested domain

991
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:38,610
in the world today cyber is exactly like

992
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:44,040
this the reason why I say that is

993
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:46,410
because sovereignty is not clear is or

994
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:50,009
it is either not clear or deliberately

995
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,440
made unclear at the same time it has a

996
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:55,470
lot of value because we put so much

997
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,930
stuff in the cyber domain right lack of

998
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:01,169
you know lack of sovereignty plus high

999
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:05,040
value again that's why cyber is such a

1000
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:09,630
highly contested domain okay you guys

1001
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:12,690
believe me no yes okay awesome okay

1002
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:15,300
now if you'll believe me if you are with

1003
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:17,850
me on this one then the next question is

1004
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,350
well if this is so simple just settle

1005
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:21,029
the sovereignty question and we have

1006
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:23,970
lots of value we have some stability

1007
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:26,940
right Jay was talking about stability

1008
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,379
why don't we just have sovereignty in

1009
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,680
place why don't we settle the question

1010
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,540
now listen to a lot of arguments and one

1011
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,640
very common argument is this thing

1012
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,550
called freedom of action

1013
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:41,129
the states right the states won that

1014
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:44,010
freedom action to do something they do

1015
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:46,860
not want to be you know burdened by some

1016
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:52,500
some laws to be in place right so

1017
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:54,870
consider this last year may 2018 the UK

1018
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,810
Attorney General basically you know made

1019
00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:00,960
a speech it at the Chatham House and he

1020
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:03,900
basically said that you know sovereignty

1021
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,400
is not a rule there's no such rule

1022
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:12,630
called sovereignty in international law

1023
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:15,420
now if if sovereignty is not a rule if

1024
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:17,880
sovereignty is not a rule then the UK

1025
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,040
can do things to other countries and

1026
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,420
there won't be any violation right if

1027
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,390
there's no rule there's no violation

1028
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,850
that's easy so I understand that freedom

1029
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:29,009
of action right in the name of national

1030
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,049
security all right so if you look at

1031
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,000
where they are going with this is that

1032
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,690
you know going back to that circle that

1033
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,880
you see there

1034
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:38,910
what are they prioritizing the

1035
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,370
prioritizing about what hitting the

1036
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:44,640
capability of the adversary taking their

1037
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:48,150
confidence level but I would argue well

1038
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,660
that is true they are doing so at the

1039
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:54,060
expense of what legitimacy right because

1040
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,029
in such in international law there's

1041
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,040
such a thing called sovereign equality

1042
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:02,550
is as you can do stuff to other people

1043
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:06,360
so can other people do stuff back to you

1044
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:09,540
right now interesting enough five months

1045
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:12,570
after he made the speech the UK NCSE

1046
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,160
national cybersecurity Center basically

1047
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:17,190
put out an article right here that says

1048
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,620
well records campaign of cyber attacks

1049
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,450
by Russian military intelligence so you

1050
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:25,170
read that article it basically outline

1051
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:26,970
all the cases that you know the UK said

1052
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,250
this is attributed to the Russian

1053
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:31,529
military intelligence and I especially

1054
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,420
want to draw attention to the writing on

1055
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:37,470
the right hand side there that says the

1056
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:40,140
GRU did all this and this is this attack

1057
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,759
has been conducted you know in violation

1058
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:45,120
of international law

1059
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,180
so so I looked at this and I say okay

1060
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,618
let's look at all the cases there and if

1061
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,348
a violation of in

1062
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:55,470
national law the question then becomes

1063
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:58,140
which rule which drew are we talking

1064
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,759
about here and I'm guessing and of

1065
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,710
course it's not being outlined in this

1066
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:05,069
particular article I'm guessing it's a

1067
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,930
sovereignty rule but hold on you're

1068
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:11,160
Attorney General just say the rule does

1069
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:13,950
not exist if you're Attorney General say

1070
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,569
it rule does not exist how do you say

1071
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,640
the Russians are violating international

1072
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:18,210
law parcel Russia has say you must be

1073
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,660
joking

1074
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:25,140
you say there was no rule and how can I

1075
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,149
now be violating the sovereignty of UK

1076
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,279
right so that's one thing that we need

1077
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:33,180
to keep in mind that this debate yeah I

1078
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:35,490
want freedom but you losing legitimacy

1079
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,950
right there okay the second thing I want

1080
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,729
to talk about okay is that I think we

1081
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:43,169
need to rethink about you know how we

1082
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:45,749
interpret harm when it comes to the

1083
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,819
cyber domain now the language that we

1084
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:50,939
always use when we talk about harm is

1085
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:53,339
this thing called injury and death to

1086
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,109
individual and destruction the property

1087
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:57,769
now it makes sense if you are thinking

1088
00:55:55,109 --> 00:56:00,210
about weapons like kinetic weapons

1089
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:02,788
chemical weapons and biological weapons

1090
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:05,849
because these weapons have violent

1091
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:07,950
consequences right if you throw cyber to

1092
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:10,489
the mix there if you throw side whether

1093
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:13,919
the mix there well cyber has both

1094
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:16,289
violent consequences and non violent

1095
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,980
consequences right there okay so what

1096
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:22,650
that means is that for cyber operations

1097
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,869
that are potentially below that use of

1098
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,819
force threshold you know you are

1099
00:56:24,869 --> 00:56:28,950
potentially going to be looking at more

1100
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:32,130
harm than you originally thought about

1101
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:36,029
okay and and you know take for example

1102
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:38,759
pics for example you know with the aid

1103
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:40,680
of cyber tools and artificial

1104
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:42,390
intelligence artificial intelligence

1105
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,629
that knows you more than you know

1106
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:48,359
yourself okay foreign adversaries can

1107
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:50,999
steal election outcome undermining

1108
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:54,480
democratic institutions and undermining

1109
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:59,098
call democracy values how much harm is

1110
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,210
that is non-violent but how much harm is

1111
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,980
that okay

1112
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,000
so we gotta think about that now I'm

1113
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,620
sure

1114
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,630
all of you here would have a few

1115
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:09,150
examples that you can think about okay

1116
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,880
when it comes to big you know this here

1117
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:14,310
right this below use of force here right

1118
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,820
now immediately you know how do you

1119
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:19,740
drive consensus right like this right

1120
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,390
this is not what we're used to but how

1121
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,910
do you drive consensus it's gonna be

1122
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:27,060
very very hard this is why I think you

1123
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:29,940
know going forward states will have to

1124
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:32,400
look at you know very narrow feel for

1125
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:35,430
example like finance where people can

1126
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,320
agree upon right so if you look at what

1127
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,049
the Carnegie Endowment for international

1128
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:44,130
peace has done is that they basically

1129
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:46,740
urging g20 countries to refrain for

1130
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:48,530
manipulating of financial data how many

1131
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:52,169
of you are familiar of this work here

1132
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:55,130
okay that's great okay so this is very

1133
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:57,540
very important that is you know you

1134
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,820
gotta walk somewhere you gotta walk

1135
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,590
somewhere and say how do I get stability

1136
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,080
into the system okay

1137
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,730
the last point I want to make and you

1138
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:10,319
know you probably remember what I just

1139
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:13,410
say early on that is you know the proof

1140
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,180
the two preconditions okay the the

1141
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:18,029
deterrence of proper deterrence

1142
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,549
framework is one is sovereignty the

1143
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,110
other one is called attribution

1144
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:24,060
attribution is key

1145
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:26,670
why because you know you gotta know who

1146
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:28,549
did what to you and why okay so with

1147
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:31,050
attribution you gotta have strong

1148
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,920
intelligence capability there's no

1149
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,530
question about that

1150
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,750
strong intelligence capability now I

1151
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:39,330
come from a private sector I'm from

1152
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:41,490
fireEye and when it comes to

1153
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:44,460
intelligence our focus is really about

1154
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:47,009
you know how do we uncover the TTP's

1155
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:49,110
that the ji-yong talked about of the you

1156
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:51,840
know the adversaries we're very very

1157
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:54,630
focused on TTP's when it comes the

1158
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,430
attribution then we are good at just

1159
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,910
attribute in to let's say a group like

1160
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:03,120
apt 10 a PT 28 not necessarily a you

1161
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:05,879
know this is job to put in did this you

1162
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,290
know see Jean King did this okay but you

1163
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,620
know attribution to that group level

1164
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:12,240
basically okay and we feel that we have

1165
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,250
the breadth of coverage out there

1166
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,680
because right now we are probably

1167
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:20,579
tracking about 1,200

1168
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:24,359
different threat groups out there now I

1169
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:27,359
doubt any government any government will

1170
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:29,759
attract 10 or 20% of what we try in

1171
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,250
terms of the you know the threat groups

1172
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,579
out there but where the government lacks

1173
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:37,619
in breath they make it up in death and

1174
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:40,890
the reason I say that is that government

1175
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:43,200
has tools to go deep into a threat

1176
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:45,720
actors organization and the other ones

1177
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,990
who have in order to the national power

1178
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,720
to say hey who is behind this thing yeah

1179
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:53,939
so who did what to us okay you gotta

1180
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,950
have the private sector and the

1181
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,349
government basically combined forces

1182
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:02,490
because you have this deaf and birth

1183
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:04,770
that you can take into consideration so

1184
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:07,500
with that ladies and gentlemen I like to

1185
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:16,680
close I look forward to discussion later

1186
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:18,630
on thank you all so we really unpacked a

1187
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,598
lot during these three presentations

1188
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:24,060
from North Korea to AIPAC to to threat

1189
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,440
intelligence I'm gonna take the

1190
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,509
motivators privilege for the first

1191
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,250
question but I invite you to start to

1192
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:33,030
think about your questions to the panel

1193
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:35,940
so I just want to go back to North Korea

1194
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,890
and the first presentation and will you

1195
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,690
describe in your paper in your

1196
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:42,720
presentations all these North Korean

1197
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:44,700
TTP's make mixing TTP's with other

1198
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,069
countries operative launching attacks

1199
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,230
from third countries with or without

1200
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:52,079
their knowledge can you share a little

1201
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:54,089
bit about how the Republic of Korea

1202
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,950
thinks about countering some of it and

1203
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:58,680
what are some of the lessons learned for

1204
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:00,689
NATO and a transatlantic space from you

1205
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,930
know how to really deal with an

1206
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:06,000
adversary who does all this okay that's

1207
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:09,810
very interesting questions since there

1208
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,140
are last two but not to answer first I

1209
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:16,410
would like to mention that the lessons

1210
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:18,839
learned from overseeing the upper cyber

1211
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:21,810
operations conducted by North Korea is

1212
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:23,549
that they are developing and still

1213
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:25,650
developing their offensive cyber

1214
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:30,090
capabilities and developing their

1215
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:34,440
technical development to circumvent the

1216
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:36,540
international sanctions and as long as

1217
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,450
they are mixing the TTP's with other

1218
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:42,810
countries a targeted country has to

1219
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:44,730
prepare and counteract cooperate in

1220
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:47,400
countries so it means that it will be

1221
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:51,330
more greater threat for the targeted

1222
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:55,650
country and as Republic of Korea which

1223
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:57,630
has been attacked by a lot attacked

1224
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,480
attacked by North Korea for several

1225
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,910
times in the past history and still

1226
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:07,020
getting attacks from North Korea is

1227
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:09,629
trying to build the global global

1228
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:11,820
corporations with our intelligence

1229
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:14,520
agencies to cooperate and share

1230
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:18,690
information and I wish that will go more

1231
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:24,540
active and then to the brother means of

1232
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:26,100
sharing systems and then yes thank you

1233
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,810
are there any questions from the

1234
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,870
audience

1235
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,870
jae-hee Lee

1236
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,259
I thank you Jason Haley's from Columbia

1237
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:40,450
University uh sorry to do this Claire

1238
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:43,250
won't comment one question um young the

1239
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:44,689
John Carlin book I think did the best he

1240
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,369
had been the head of the National

1241
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:48,619
Security Division at the Department of

1242
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:50,180
Justice and in is the closest I've seen

1243
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:51,440
to an official denial from the United

1244
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:54,109
States that they weren't behind the

1245
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,210
denial of service attack following the

1246
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:57,980
Sony attack the White House when I was

1247
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,090
talking to them afterwards inside

1248
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,340
they're like man I wish you would just

1249
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:03,710
deny this this was a nos this isn't our

1250
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,359
style of this apparently they didn't

1251
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:07,520
want to deny at the time because if we

1252
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:09,500
start denying things then we get caught

1253
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,750
up with was a covert action you know we

1254
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,490
don't want to confirm or deny said John

1255
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,410
Carlin spoke on this is really really

1256
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,859
strong and he does come out and say it

1257
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:20,720
wasn't us it was some private group and

1258
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:21,830
yes it's a really good book so thank you

1259
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,660
and thank you all for the for the

1260
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:26,480
presentation cocking the you know you

1261
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:29,720
finished with you talk about legitimacy

1262
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,369
and you talk about confidence and you've

1263
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,919
finished for the slide on attribution

1264
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:36,020
yeah and many of us here have been

1265
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,600
caught up in the talks on the cyber

1266
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,100
peace Institute that's been proposed in

1267
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,900
maybe an independent attribution

1268
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,920
organization and it kind of falls in

1269
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,119
between your model there on the depth of

1270
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,320
the government and the breadth of the

1271
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,030
private sector I'm curious your thoughts

1272
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,040
on that and maybe miho if you have

1273
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:53,359
thoughts on that as well thank you sorry

1274
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,590
Jay can I just clarify I mean

1275
01:03:53,359 --> 01:04:01,670
independent in tribution organization

1276
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:02,810
yeah so there's been this push that you

1277
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,220
know tied up with tech accords

1278
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:06,650
individual Geneva Convention and

1279
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:09,169
Microsoft and others and saying maybe we

1280
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:12,100
need a a separate group because maybe

1281
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:14,960
some countries don't necessarily

1282
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,339
understand a fire I or agree with the

1283
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,690
fire assessment they're looking for a

1284
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,030
state assessment but the states aren't

1285
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:22,040
necessarily doing public attribution so

1286
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,930
maybe we need some kind of independent

1287
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:27,680
nonprofit group that would come out and

1288
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:29,810
in do attribution I I think Jay there

1289
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,879
was a discussion in the UN around that

1290
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:34,040
particular topic to in fact one member

1291
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,590
state basically say I we agree to that

1292
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:40,029
so long as that independent organization

1293
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,030
is in my country

1294
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:45,379
so I I think it's gonna be very hard to

1295
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,788
get consensus around this in terms of

1296
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:50,869
either who do you trust

1297
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:52,520
I mean I I know of that incident so I

1298
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:55,250
think it's gonna be hard I mean if you

1299
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,288
get my thoughts on that there's gonna be

1300
01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:00,799
ideological differences between

1301
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:03,770
countries so that's why this country

1302
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,250
says yeah I like it so long this is my

1303
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:08,210
country

1304
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:11,180
yeah so you know yeah

1305
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:13,430
oh so thank you for your question so

1306
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:14,868
when you save as an attribute are you

1307
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:17,359
talking about the public contribution

1308
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:20,559
who are more private attribution public

1309
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:24,020
contribution so so public attribution is

1310
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:27,650
important for states or government to

1311
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:33,200
make a achieve response to cyber attacks

1312
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:33,680
like Diigo the indictment Neiman

1313
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,990
ashaming

1314
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,970
[Music]

1315
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:41,359
financial sanctions or even the media

1316
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:45,529
response to do that you have to have an

1317
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:47,270
accurate attribution but for from

1318
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:49,099
industry perspective I don't think that

1319
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:52,460
public activision is necessary for

1320
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:56,059
having a good deterrence or good cyber

1321
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:58,339
defense because if you have a good cyber

1322
01:05:56,059 --> 01:06:01,010
hygiene or good understanding with

1323
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:03,140
cybersecurity or solutions then you're

1324
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:05,450
gonna have a better chance to protect

1325
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,430
yourself from cyber attacks or at least

1326
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:10,520
your minimize the chance of the

1327
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:14,930
expansion of infection so for example I

1328
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,730
talked about the issues surrounding the

1329
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:19,368
small and medium-sized companies and

1330
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:22,539
they don't have budget or people to do

1331
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:26,750
that but and they only need a small

1332
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:29,079
solution at a reasonable price was best

1333
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:32,420
practices to how to make it better and

1334
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:34,809
you don't need attribution to make it

1335
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,809
happen

1336
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:41,759
Thank You Tina Park from the NATO

1337
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:43,828
Defense College

1338
01:06:41,759 --> 01:06:46,019
I wonder if our two speakers could

1339
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:48,390
comment about future prospects for

1340
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:50,160
collaboration Republic of Korea and

1341
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:52,379
Japan are both partner countries for the

1342
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,828
Alliance and our moderator sort of

1343
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:58,769
hinted at this prospect earlier and I

1344
01:06:55,829 --> 01:07:00,990
wondered if you see any room for greater

1345
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:03,149
collaboration on the cyber domain and

1346
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:04,919
moving forward and if so in what

1347
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:07,079
capacity because both of you did a very

1348
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,619
good job of highlighting multi-faceted

1349
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:12,420
nature of cyber capabilities from North

1350
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:14,759
Korea as well as you know other threats

1351
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,299
in the asia-pacific region so when we

1352
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:20,249
look at the future of the Alliance as we

1353
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:22,859
reflect upon the 70th anniversary this

1354
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:29,490
year where do you see actual tangible

1355
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:32,808
collaboration taking place you mean

1356
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:38,779
cooperation between NATO Japan and NATO

1357
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:43,619
so I think it was an hour earlier today

1358
01:07:38,779 --> 01:07:46,410
after before the missus uh Nora gave his

1359
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:48,569
presentation about Japanese cyber

1360
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:51,239
deterrence on a cyber defense strategy

1361
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:53,549
not an answer NATO CCDC or II mentioned

1362
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:56,849
that the growing cooperation between

1363
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:59,730
Japan and narrow and also Estonia about

1364
01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:06,029
cyber security and I I think it's great

1365
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:08,970
because if you limit it to yourself if

1366
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:11,299
you if you crawl yourself from outside

1367
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:14,160
knowledge about NASA because

1368
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:16,198
individually we can have only limited

1369
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,899
knowledge under the only limited

1370
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:21,568
visibility of a cyber environment cyber

1371
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:24,540
threats and solutions or technologies

1372
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:27,060
but if we can work together and

1373
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:29,850
especially Estonia has a unique history

1374
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,400
of cyber security and NATO already have

1375
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:35,429
that the corrective knowledge of cyber

1376
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,269
defence and cyber security so I really

1377
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:39,540
appreciate that

1378
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:41,759
to hear that Japan is increasing the

1379
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:46,080
cooperation on cyber security with NATO

1380
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:49,198
and also Estonia okay since Korea

1381
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,089
Republic of Korea is not to have not

1382
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,000
joined the cCTC we

1383
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:57,149
I will I mean in my opinion I expect

1384
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,290
South Korea to join the CCT cos soon and

1385
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:03,469
then I would like to mention a brief a

1386
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:06,899
past case to talk about the

1387
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:10,770
collaboration among other countries for

1388
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:13,290
South Korea in 2018 the Pyeongchang

1389
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:15,390
Winter Olympic during the opening

1390
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:18,269
ceremony there was a network failure

1391
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:22,319
caused by an anonymous group which is

1392
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:25,560
which is attributed to countries that

1393
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,680
are not defined yet however to prepare

1394
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:31,080
the incident like South Korean

1395
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:34,380
government had collaborated with other

1396
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:36,420
intelligence agencies from the United

1397
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:39,660
States or England or other countries and

1398
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:43,350
then they have collaborated to rebuild

1399
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:46,439
or restore when the network goes down so

1400
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:48,930
when the network went it went into the

1401
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:52,549
failure at the opening ceremony they

1402
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:57,330
worked in the collaborate movements to

1403
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:59,130
to rework it in 12 hours so after the

1404
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:00,809
incident the Korean government realized

1405
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:03,750
about the importance of like

1406
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:06,150
collaborating with each other so I know

1407
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:09,420
I have heard that there are still

1408
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:11,730
movements to join the international

1409
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,140
organizations to collaborate more

1410
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,820
actively thank you

1411
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,950
and how can I know you've done a lot of

1412
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:18,660
work with NATO so I'd be really

1413
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,490
interested in hearing you know in terms

1414
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:23,670
of collaboration but also how do you

1415
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:25,740
think the alliance should should change

1416
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:28,350
or is changing its approach when you

1417
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:30,420
think about the diffused power in cyber

1418
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:32,550
I mean there's been major adversaries

1419
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,410
the organization's been working to to

1420
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,560
address but I mean there is a whole

1421
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:39,360
other range of actors out there that

1422
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,160
that I think NATO should think about so

1423
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,360
how what what do you think is there to

1424
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:48,030
do on NATO side I think I speak more

1425
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:50,700
towards NATO member states how many of

1426
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:52,740
you were here when the president Estonia

1427
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,599
gave a speech and basically make a

1428
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:57,000
declaration saying that international

1429
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:00,090
law applies to cyber operation or you

1430
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,370
guys were here okay if you were not here

1431
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,290
okay you miss something very important

1432
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:07,710
okay

1433
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:09,360
me that was basically you know the first

1434
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,800
step right so when you have diffusion of

1435
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,429
power you're gonna have many many

1436
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,950
players here so you know you and in

1437
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:18,660
classical security dilemma probably will

1438
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:21,780
kicked in in the sense that you know if

1439
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:24,269
I see this country investing in cyber

1440
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:27,500
capability then hey maybe I should too

1441
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:30,660
and so the the question becomes you know

1442
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:32,730
what rules are available to govern the

1443
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:36,750
behavior of all these different states

1444
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:39,259
out there so so for the Estonian state

1445
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:42,510
leader to come up and say you know

1446
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:45,210
international law applies to cyber space

1447
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:47,820
it's a very big thing in fact you know

1448
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:49,410
this is basically saying you uphold the

1449
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:52,230
rule of law and rule of international

1450
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:54,420
law that is one rule that we make sure

1451
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,309
that everyone plays with so that's the

1452
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,660
important thing here the second thing

1453
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,600
I'd like to mention there is really

1454
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:03,000
about stability right so you saw that

1455
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,880
picture that the graph that I mentioned

1456
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,830
okay and I also you know really liked

1457
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,860
what Jay was saying yesterday about you

1458
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:13,860
know we should do everything we can okay

1459
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,929
so that we don't come to this use of

1460
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:18,389
force threshold a we try to keep things

1461
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:20,190
really really stable there so I will

1462
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:23,070
encourage one you know different

1463
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:26,250
countries leaders to do exactly what the

1464
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:28,980
Estonian leader has just done say okay

1465
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:33,540
this is classical opinion of the u.s. to

1466
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:36,150
is that support in the norms that you

1467
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,130
know promote stability especially those

1468
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,740
areas that are under the use of force

1469
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:43,530
right I mentioned one just now and that

1470
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:47,010
is the you know the the Carnegie

1471
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:49,769
proposal there are a few that I can

1472
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:52,560
think about also like Perry's call which

1473
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:55,260
is actually you know a feature event in

1474
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:59,400
this CCDC ohyeah the challenge with

1475
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:02,070
Paris Codel is that for anything to if

1476
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:04,259
you want to get anything done in in a

1477
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:07,710
cyber space you could have at least US

1478
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:09,780
Russia and China in there I don't think

1479
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,400
you have us in the Paris call

1480
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,050
I don't think yet Russia in there I

1481
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,120
don't think you have China in there and

1482
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:18,090
that's the challenge right there so the

1483
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,860
financial proposal by Carnegie I am sure

1484
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,320
because of the security in the

1485
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:23,790
dependency in the financial war I'm sure

1486
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,469
the Chinese will agree that this is

1487
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:27,269
important the Russians will agree the

1488
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,800
Americans will agree on that too so I

1489
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:33,120
think you need to have major powers

1490
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:36,780
buy-in as well thank you can I add one

1491
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:39,750
thing yes sorry also I forgot to mention

1492
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:42,990
that in how Japan can contribute to the

1493
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:45,360
collaboration with NATO so Japan has our

1494
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:48,210
nearly a unique experience is caused by

1495
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:51,389
natural disasters and cyber attacks and

1496
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:53,730
Japan faces lots of different types of

1497
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:58,020
natural disasters fraud in earthquakes

1498
01:13:53,730 --> 01:14:00,389
and typhoons so Japan has a huge amount

1499
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:04,920
of knowledge and expertise to how to

1500
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:07,140
react on how to respond to risks caused

1501
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,720
by the combination of natural disasters

1502
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:12,480
and cyber attacks so because in

1503
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,310
interdependency of the critical

1504
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,379
infrastructure sectors and also between

1505
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:19,320
the private sector and the government I

1506
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:21,450
think that the Japan can share how we

1507
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:23,400
make it happen to have bring the

1508
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:26,370
resiliency to the protection of critical

1509
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,259
infrastructure from the physical domain

1510
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:36,150
and also from cyber domain to bring it

1511
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:39,200
back to NATO countries there's a couple

1512
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:39,200
of there in the back

1513
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:47,179
and then app then there's some more all

1514
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,309
the way at the end thank you so this is

1515
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:50,900
also a collaboration question but

1516
01:14:49,309 --> 01:14:53,090
perhaps a little touchy er there was a

1517
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:56,268
lot of talk about China and its growing

1518
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:58,880
influence in the region um and I was

1519
01:14:56,269 --> 01:15:00,979
wondering how firm the dividing line

1520
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,070
between China and Japan and South Korea

1521
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:07,090
has become and if there's any areas for

1522
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:09,199
cooperation in cyberspace between

1523
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:11,360
participants in the region or if it's

1524
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:21,978
really and us/them dichotomy at this

1525
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:24,739
point is it look cool a couple questions

1526
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:26,420
on oh please just got like to answer

1527
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:29,388
this question and down we'll go we'll go

1528
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:33,619
to the back please go ahead feel free to

1529
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:36,739
answer now so so ji-hyun canal on one

1530
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:39,799
example data corporation so the Japanese

1531
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:42,428
and South Koreans and the Chinese

1532
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:45,469
actually had a cybersecurity dialogue

1533
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:47,209
twice in the past to discuss of what

1534
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:50,440
kind of a cybersecurity strategy and

1535
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:52,550
each country has and what kind of

1536
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:55,789
cybersecurity actions that they are

1537
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:59,389
taking so I think that way that they can

1538
01:15:55,789 --> 01:16:02,059
continue to identify whom to talk to

1539
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:04,309
and what kind of national strategies and

1540
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:06,860
actions that they are taking so it is

1541
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:11,690
not novel for the confidence building on

1542
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:13,929
a weekend person thank you question in

1543
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:13,928
the back

1544
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:26,220
hi had a question more geared towards

1545
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:29,370
mr. ho and first lieutenant Cong what

1546
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:31,830
would you say to the idea that countries

1547
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:34,140
like North Korea and non-state actors

1548
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:36,690
like terrorist groups get their

1549
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:40,710
confidence and legit legit Ameen see

1550
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:44,870
almost boost by getting exposed by media

1551
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:47,220
outlets on different television networks

1552
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:50,849
so I guess the question is you know

1553
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:53,850
we're kind of helping the legitimacy by

1554
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:56,880
talking publicly about what these actors

1555
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:58,560
are doing oh absolutely I mean if you if

1556
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,739
you look at terrorist group terrorist

1557
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,739
group has been using the media to to

1558
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:07,980
promote their cause right so one thing

1559
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:10,559
that they do a terrorist job is to is to

1560
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:14,370
create terror right so if they can

1561
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:16,860
create terror in in the population and

1562
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:20,550
they can also show that the government

1563
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:23,460
is actually powerless right it has they

1564
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:24,900
are powerless to stop them

1565
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,600
you know it's gonna boost their

1566
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:30,540
confidence level right the legitimacy

1567
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:34,650
part is not usually done with media I

1568
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:36,800
think is usually looking at you know

1569
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:40,019
terrorist group they derive legitimacy

1570
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,910
from you know some some higher being

1571
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,770
right in this case God right there right

1572
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:46,830
so it's always God was you know

1573
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:49,980
sanctioning what they do right there

1574
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:51,950
now speaking of General Petraeus talked

1575
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:55,259
about a terrorist called Anwar Awlaki

1576
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:57,269
yesterday and I thought that was a

1577
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:01,350
really interesting discussion because

1578
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:03,090
this man he's actually you know he's

1579
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,850
actually worth more date than he's

1580
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:08,760
actually alive and the reason it has to

1581
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:11,130
do with legitimacy right there is so if

1582
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:16,250
you look at Anwar Awlaki you know he

1583
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:19,200
this MV M&E American you know cleric

1584
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:21,330
which is associated with AQAP or

1585
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,519
al-qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and

1586
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,950
General Petraeus talked about you know

1587
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,760
he was actually killed in a in a drone

1588
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:31,500
incident with the editor of the inspire

1589
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,870
magazine AQAP had a

1590
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,850
magazine called inspire the guy who got

1591
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:38,580
killed is called some milk on this

1592
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:40,560
editor right there and I think a lucky

1593
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:44,040
son was also in the same car and they

1594
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,400
all three died in in that incident so he

1595
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:49,769
has been preaching a lot and and you can

1596
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:52,099
see that before he got killed he

1597
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:55,350
basically inspired maybe two or three

1598
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:58,140
incidents but after he was dead and you

1599
01:18:55,350 --> 01:19:01,020
know people keep on uploading stuff his

1600
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:03,660
sermon on YouTube and that basically

1601
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:05,550
went on to inspire many more terrorist

1602
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:08,610
incident right so San Bernardino

1603
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:11,670
incident the Boston Marathon incident so

1604
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:13,469
you know sometimes we buy meat you know

1605
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:15,450
so what the United States did was

1606
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:17,190
paralyzing what they want to kill

1607
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:18,840
capture the terrorists right they want

1608
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:21,389
to keep them on the capability the

1609
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:25,890
confidence level what is that is that

1610
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:28,200
done that has expense of what legitimacy

1611
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:31,410
that guy you know became even more

1612
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,690
legitimate when he went on after he was

1613
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:35,070
dead to inspire many more terrorist

1614
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:37,469
incidents so I think we have to be very

1615
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:39,030
careful about this it's probably a lot

1616
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:41,190
easier to try to undermine his

1617
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:43,230
legitimacy instead of just you know

1618
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:49,410
shooting him in the head or drop a bomb

1619
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:52,860
on his head I just like to add the North

1620
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:56,550
Korea it's hard to get them into a pie

1621
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:58,980
by international norms so even though US

1622
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:02,460
officials have been accused on South um

1623
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:05,219
three North Korea to for their cyber

1624
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,340
attacks um they have been publicly

1625
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:12,060
denied but no more actions nor no more

1626
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:14,660
like publicly saying about the there are

1627
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,660
three positions

1628
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:24,290
so we've I'm gonna again use my

1629
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,820
moderator privilege because we really

1630
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:28,640
wanted to talk about some of the

1631
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:30,110
deterrence issues and some things we we

1632
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,030
talked a little very little about the

1633
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:35,719
turns today and how the diffusion power

1634
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:38,240
impacts the turns so I'd like to hear

1635
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,010
your opinions on you know what how are

1636
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:43,280
the changing strategies in your

1637
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:45,380
respective countries with respect this

1638
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,360
diffusion of power so Japan has

1639
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:48,920
published a new defense strategy I liked

1640
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,450
a little bit about the the south korean

1641
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,520
defense strategy and how they are

1642
01:20:50,450 --> 01:21:01,550
reacting to to the changes we're seeing

1643
01:20:52,520 --> 01:21:03,320
in a Fed landscape South Korea is it's

1644
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:05,960
realizing the importance of cyber

1645
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:08,540
security and intelligence of course and

1646
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,790
it's trying to get more active on these

1647
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:14,900
cyber corporations but I think in this

1648
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:18,680
to be more the government needs to state

1649
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:21,650
more stronger organization to put off

1650
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:24,110
first and then reach other intelligence

1651
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:26,000
agencies to cooperate and then share

1652
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:29,450
information more and then stuff like

1653
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,330
that and then for I think for the

1654
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:35,450
lessons taken from the mixing TTP's with

1655
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:38,660
other countries like North Korea does um

1656
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:41,929
NATO should be the first to be the

1657
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:45,019
baseline to make other nations to join

1658
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:49,370
their information sharing system to get

1659
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:51,290
more bigger and more massive a system of

1660
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:54,530
like sharing information to get be

1661
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:56,510
trusted and then to make deterrence for

1662
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:59,030
the actions something like the mixing

1663
01:21:56,510 --> 01:22:02,260
TTP's cannot be happened anymore

1664
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:05,360
even when they are attributed we can

1665
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:13,940
counteract with more strong intelligence

1666
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:17,809
with the sharing information so so Japan

1667
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:19,549
not only to have a successful Tokyo

1668
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:24,560
Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic

1669
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:28,190
Games in 2020 but also to to have to

1670
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,750
play important role in the international

1671
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:31,610
cyber security community

1672
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:33,980
so the Japanese government and also

1673
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:36,860
Japanese industry are taking important

1674
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:38,599
steps so for example the Japanese

1675
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:42,410
Ministry depends on self-defense forces

1676
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:45,040
issued a new national defense guidelines

1677
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:48,410
program in the last year's to

1678
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:51,950
specifically mention the cross sector

1679
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:54,440
across domain of security and importance

1680
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:56,750
of our cyber security but not only that

1681
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,280
the Ministry economy and Trade and

1682
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,710
Industry and Ministry of Internal

1683
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:04,759
Affairs and communications are creating

1684
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:06,620
the guidelines for IOT security and also

1685
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,890
cyber security guidelines for

1686
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:12,950
specifically for each sector in critical

1687
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:16,010
infrastructure sectors and also then the

1688
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:20,210
industries are helping to provide early

1689
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:22,100
life experiences and also to to make it

1690
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:25,100
happen we have to have a good

1691
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:27,830
cybersecurity people so we are

1692
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:30,920
cooperating with academia and the

1693
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:33,110
government to have a good ecosystem or

1694
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:36,590
two to cultivate cybersecurity

1695
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:39,019
professionals so I think that is being a

1696
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:41,510
multi-layered efforts to have a good

1697
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:44,540
people good technologies and good

1698
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:49,190
processes to have a better deterrence in

1699
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:51,769
cyberspace I would like to offer my

1700
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:54,110
thoughts on you know I listen to this

1701
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:57,350
conference yesterday and this is the

1702
01:23:54,110 --> 01:24:00,080
u.s. strategy on PE I think he's

1703
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:03,680
persistent engagement and then DF is the

1704
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,570
defence forward so so you know I've been

1705
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,500
thinking through this you know over the

1706
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:13,460
course of yesterday and also today I

1707
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:15,800
think we have to be very careful when it

1708
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:18,020
comes to you know this idea of defending

1709
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,260
forward okay

1710
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:24,560
I hope the United States do not do so by

1711
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,510
let's say removing that sovereignty rule

1712
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,330
like the the the violation of

1713
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:33,050
sovereignty rule because I think it has

1714
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:35,450
you know really bad consequences if they

1715
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:37,400
did that right so now it may sound like

1716
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:39,349
a really great idea that the United

1717
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:41,629
States can say okay you know this Isis

1718
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:42,810
group let's say there's no rule call

1719
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:44,760
sovereignty in place

1720
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:46,440
okay these Isis guys you know they have

1721
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:49,020
cyber assets in different parts of the

1722
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:52,019
war we can go in there and we can just

1723
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:54,000
take them out okay we could mean damage

1724
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:56,130
their stuff blow things up whatever

1725
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,710
right and that may sound like a really

1726
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:02,070
great thing until China comes in and say

1727
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:04,650
hey we also have terrorists that you

1728
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:06,990
know we like to address to we have

1729
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:09,780
dissidents from the cynjohn province

1730
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:12,360
that we've got pro-democracy people in

1731
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:15,780
Taiwan and they have cyber assets in the

1732
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:19,200
US and then cable and then Indonesia

1733
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:21,120
comes along and say hey you know you

1734
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,540
know we have a terrorist group called

1735
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,670
jamya

1736
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:26,130
Islamia that we like to take out and

1737
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:28,500
they have cyber assets in the United

1738
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:31,290
States - and both Indonesia and China

1739
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,570
say hey if the u.s. can do defend

1740
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:36,660
forward we should also do defend forward

1741
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:39,660
and they say well let's you know let's

1742
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:42,870
defend forward and break stuff in the

1743
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:45,960
United States and so when you don't have

1744
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:48,780
a rule like that in place it's going to

1745
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:51,570
lead to very bad consequences because in

1746
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:54,000
the war of diffusion of power you know

1747
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:54,450
we're you know not that US can just do

1748
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,460
that

1749
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:59,040
the Chinese can do that the in donations

1750
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,740
can do that then we can have a big

1751
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:03,750
problem going forward right so this is

1752
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:06,420
you know I think we have to be very

1753
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:08,490
clear now of course the the question

1754
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:10,800
then becomes if you had a rule called

1755
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:12,570
sovereignty is that an absolute rule

1756
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,400
does that mean you cannot do anything at

1757
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:16,860
all and that's entirely not true right

1758
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,960
so if anyone is reading the Italian

1759
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:21,929
manual you should refer to rule number

1760
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,000
four okay rule number four talks about

1761
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:26,910
you know the sovereignty issue and how

1762
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,890
do we dissect you know what you can or

1763
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:31,230
you cannot do within the sovereignty

1764
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:34,170
rule right so I would urge you to look

1765
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:36,150
into for and really the discussion going

1766
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:38,460
forward is couldn't be States thinking

1767
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:41,070
it okay we have to rule in place we need

1768
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:43,350
to come into an agreement as to what is

1769
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:44,309
permissible and what is not permissible

1770
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:47,880
okay

1771
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:49,760
and so and I think that's that is super

1772
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:53,580
important going forward

1773
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:56,369
thank you any last questions or comments

1774
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:58,440
well then on this very high narrow

1775
01:26:56,369 --> 01:27:00,348
thank you also for Mikey oh sorry there

1776
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,598
is a there's someone in the back

1777
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:05,400
apologies

1778
01:27:02,599 --> 01:27:07,440
sorry I promise it's quick please with

1779
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,329
cyber law international I have a

1780
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,518
question for a cocking and for miss

1781
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:13,978
matzah bottom so you both come from the

1782
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:15,840
private sector and past years cyber

1783
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:18,989
incidents have clearly demonstrated how

1784
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:22,530
companies can end up being tangled and

1785
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:23,909
interstate Affairs so what do your

1786
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:26,659
respective companies what kind of

1787
01:27:23,909 --> 01:27:30,150
expectations do they have towards

1788
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:31,949
governments in order to ensure that your

1789
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:34,739
companies do not become the victim of

1790
01:27:31,949 --> 01:27:35,549
such malicious cyber activity and should

1791
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:37,949
this happen

1792
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:40,260
especially those very high end

1793
01:27:37,949 --> 01:27:42,089
devastating operations what kind of

1794
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:44,400
expectations would you have towards your

1795
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:47,190
government to mitigate you may be

1796
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:50,789
compensate what would your corporations

1797
01:27:47,190 --> 01:28:00,388
expect of your respective governments at

1798
01:27:50,789 --> 01:28:02,639
least you ask all the hot question to

1799
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:04,469
have a better cybersecurity you have to

1800
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,329
have a good visibility because if you

1801
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:09,869
don't have a good visibility how you can

1802
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:12,058
control your risks so to make it happen

1803
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:13,920
before the industry you know that you

1804
01:28:12,059 --> 01:28:17,610
you have to raise cybersecurity

1805
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:19,739
awareness especially from the executive

1806
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:24,558
levels and it's been already happening

1807
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:27,119
in Japan and now you also have to have

1808
01:28:24,559 --> 01:28:28,949
continuous dialogues between government

1809
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,940
and the private sectors because

1810
01:28:28,949 --> 01:28:34,860
government is responsible to the having

1811
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:37,169
practical cybersecurity strategy or

1812
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:39,598
recreations or policy and by the

1813
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:41,809
government the judges and companies have

1814
01:28:39,599 --> 01:28:44,309
better visibility and access to

1815
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:47,429
technologies and also the problem is

1816
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:49,949
happening in industries so I'm pleased

1817
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:51,719
to see that neither these conversations

1818
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:54,478
are happening between the Japanese

1819
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:57,900
government and industry and of course we

1820
01:28:54,479 --> 01:29:01,110
will continue to see different types of

1821
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,509
cyberattacks and risks around Japanese

1822
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:07,320
government in the industry but now I'm

1823
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:08,789
sure am I'm certain that Japan can

1824
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,690
corroborate with

1825
01:29:08,789 --> 01:29:12,809
like-minded

1826
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:14,759
countries and also NATO's to meet to

1827
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:17,820
have a better cyber deterrence on the

1828
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,260
cyber defense thank you I have to wrap

1829
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,820
up unfortunately here I don't want to

1830
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:23,160
get in trouble with the uniformed guys

1831
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:25,500
here at the native CCD series so join me

1832
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,280
in thanking the rest of the panel for

1833
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,280
the presentation
