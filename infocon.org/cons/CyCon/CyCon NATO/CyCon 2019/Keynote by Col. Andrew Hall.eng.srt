[Applause]

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:12,928
Wow hi I think that that qualifies us

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:17,070
one of the most interesting keynotes a

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:21,420
Definitely Maybe now we have in fact

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:25,198
seen at all so we have one slide which

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,490
has our date as our four as we're taking

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,439
a look at and where we're going to go

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,330
forward but if we take just a couple

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,130
minutes to go back and you think of what

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,280
you've done while you've been here we've

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,500
taken a look at some of the technologies

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,750
we got to take a look at blockchain

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,700
early in the week we've seen AI we've

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,649
seen AI from the legal perspective as

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
well as what technical perspective we've

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,079
got a chance to think about things that

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,149
we don't necessarily always get to do

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,210
and I talked with lawyers who were

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,879
enjoying the policy sessions and then I

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,170
I know that there were technical people

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,890
enjoying the law session so we get a

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,329
nice way to work together and to really

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,460
really come together there's there's few

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,590
things that that we knew necessarily we

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,179
were going to see you know one of the

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,299
things I really enjoy is social network

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,340
analysis and so it was fun to see that

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,040
technology we've been working on in the

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,960
network science and in bringing that

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,780
back in and as another one of the tools

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,059
that we can use in our toolkit and we we

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,409
saw an address today just now but also

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,299
some other discussion over the last few

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,700
days on sovereignty and really how

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,009
important that is going to be as we go

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,119
forward there are some really important

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,770
issues that need to be brought up and

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,250
many of us need to really come to grips

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,070
on what we want to do may not be what we

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,649
need to do and one of the things that we

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,798
are going to look as we go forward

42
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,110
towards saikhan in the fall back in the

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,960
United States is the notion of defending

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,340
forward and as soon as we put out the

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,270
call for papers that said we're going to

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,560
look at defending forward I got some

47
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,949
correspondence that said that's not

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,470
exactly what we mean and I just thought

49
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,829
was ironic that I took some general

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,690
guide

51
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,330
so on what we had gotten I put it into

52
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,250
two words we had defend forward we put

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,200
it out for a call for papers and it

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,300
immediately generated discussion so I'm

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,730
hoping that will continue as we go

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,220
between now and the time that we'll get

57
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,840
together in November to really talk

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,050
about what it means to defend forward

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,110
we're going to need to work as allies

60
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,410
friends like-minded nations to really

61
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,450
figure out how do we defend forward how

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,270
do we work together how do we ensure

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,070
that we are all in this to make the

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,220
internet safe because we don't really

65
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,950
want to unplug and have sovereign

66
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,930
networks where we're each on our own but

67
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,049
we want to be able to continue to work

68
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,570
together now we we've seen some things

69
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,750
where there have been some surprises and

70
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,410
I am sure that if you were at the Air

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,000
Force Academy in 1994 to 1998 you

72
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,660
wouldn't necessarily thought that the

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,230
the leader of the cyber CCD Co II was

74
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,600
going to be there but we needed to make

75
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,090
investments in time and then they

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,730
eventually pay off so the partnerships

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,350
and I think as we take a look at that's

78
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,940
part of the time that we spend here just

79
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,430
getting together and chance to talk

80
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,380
about the the different issues that are

81
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,510
prevalent and all of our nations are

82
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,480
really important as we make friends and

83
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,880
continue these friendships so I really

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,160
look forward to talking with all of you

85
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,340
as we come back in Washington DC on the

86
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,470
18th or 20th of November as we get an

87
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,970
opportunity to explore what it means to

88
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,970
defend Ford thank you
