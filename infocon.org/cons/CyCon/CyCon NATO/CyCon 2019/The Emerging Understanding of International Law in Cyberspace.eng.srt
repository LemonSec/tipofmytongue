1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:10,200
hello and welcome again from this end of

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:13,559
the and so this is the afternoon session

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,928
on emerging international law in in

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,779
cyberspace and where we will talk about

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,640
the role of international law and norms

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:25,380
in furthering security instability in

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,840
cyberspace and I think over the 11 years

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,070
of sight gun I have witnessed together

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,340
with many of you in there in the

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,730
audience the evolution of international

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,270
law discussion over cyberspace and state

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,578
cyber operations and to recap where we

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
are today

14
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,870
yes we've probably heard it out nauseam

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,780
that there's no felt generally

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,760
recognized that that international

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,610
existing international law lies to

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,968
cyberspace it's been confirmed by the UN

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:01,500
GG reports by individual and joint

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,570
statements of nations in statements of

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:10,080
regional organizations not least

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:11,729
actually the estonia's official

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,158
positions on the applicability of

24
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,259
international law or with regard to

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
international law that the president

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,689
spoke about yesterday and the weight of

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,439
the debate over international law has

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,798
clearly shifted to how those norms and

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,029
how international law applies and this

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,290
is very clearly a process that is

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,200
neither predetermined nor nor singular

32
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,270
we are figuratively speaking sitting in

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,670
a flying airplane and trying to figure

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,649
out where the where the norms and and

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,439
and how we how we should stare that and

36
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:51,420
there are a host of different issues of

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,559
varied specificity that to require

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,909
answers certainly from states who who

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,820
after all make law and then there are a

40
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,100
few prerequisites that define our

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,128
options today as the West we tend to be

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,859
or we we hold the position that perform

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,420
inventing new treaty law the global

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,360
community could do well to figure out

45
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,100
the application and and respect the

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,130
rules that we already have in place and

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,820
secondly feasibly there all the calls

48
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,180
were an international treaty are at best

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:31,420
substitute action and that were more

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,120
reasonably hypocrisy so with these

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,820
issues pressing there is no a host of

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,520
initiatives to bring substance and

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,030
clarity to what responsible state

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,510
conduct in cyberspace is and to promote

55
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,820
promote non-binding international norms

56
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,649
driven by States international and

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,140
regional organizations as well as the

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,980
private sector they will vary in the

59
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,630
scope and purpose and origin and the the

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,450
content of these proposals fluctuates

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,280
from from elementary and non specific to

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,190
fragmented and occasionally

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,800
contradictory but all the various

64
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,440
parties seek norms for cyberspace and

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,090
have rather different understanding of

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,280
the desired desired end state and the

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,680
means to get there in particular but

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,670
what I appreciate and would be what we

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,530
have what we are seeing is the clearly

70
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,269
propositions for concrete commitments

71
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,050
rather than the restatement of the

72
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:32,590
importance of cybersecurity and whether

73
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:36,370
these initiatives have will have a

74
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,340
practical impact and do what and and if

75
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:44,800
so what it will be is something that is

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:48,400
perfectly fitting to be discussed here

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,510
it's like on so against this backdrop

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,490

might take a couple of immediate

113
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,770
questions after after that but then open

114
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,539

ambassador jahaly the floor is all yours

119
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,820
so thank you I have to maneuver out from

120
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,740
my chair first of all I think for us the

121
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,270
practicing diplomats the internet the

122
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,480
question of international law is a

123
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,419
paramount question above all other

124
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,110
questions what we are concentrating on

125
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:13,000
right now in our discussions it is quite

126
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,970
clear that the states have to behave in

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,130
this new domain as they behave in

128
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:23,500
conventional domain our president

129
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:26,170
yesterday said that if these operations

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,660
and activities that are going on in

131
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:33,530
cyberspace right now would happen in

132
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:37,490
conventional domain this would not

133
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,559
result with no action but in cyberspace

134
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,860
quite often all these malicious

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,910
activities and operations are not

136
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,570
bringing any immediate result we are

137
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,000
working on several fronts how we make

138
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,780
States behave responsibly in this domain

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,600
there have been several different

140
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,750
activities since I'm proud to say 2007

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,910
Estonian attacks because Estonia was the

142
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,660
first country to put forward the ideas

143
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:12,890
to have cyber defence and cyber security

144
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:18,950
policy process in NATO in OSCE we pushed

145
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:21,340
for the new gge in 2009 and we were

146
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,500
quite actively advocating for

147
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,530
international response to cyber

148
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:31,190
operations and cyber attacks twelve

149
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,679
years after the 2007 we have actually

150
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,560
the glass half full

151
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:42,200
NATO has started with cyber defence

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,770
policies as early as 2008 the new UN GT

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,050
has been put together in 2009 and we

154
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:54,469
have had successive GTS

155
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:58,669
from 2009 to 2015 17 the new GT is now

156
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:01,070
going to put together in 2019 so and we

157
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,729
are not still there yet which also shows

158
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,310
that there is a lot of work to do and

159
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:10,130
therefore the discussions like saikhan

160
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:15,470
and the discussions in other fora what

161
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:18,890
we have had have very high importance

162
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:24,460
for the future of how we are going to

163
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:26,719
preserve the stability and also

164
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,510
interoperability of the whole cyber

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,180
domain and let me very briefly introduce

166
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:39,319
what kind of international frameworks we

167
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:42,500
have right now and what are those areas

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,720
were we are currently working and maybe

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,730
those areas where we should do a bit

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,780
more of

171
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:55,050
effort in order to make sure that

172
00:08:48,780 --> 00:09:00,189
cyberspace will be as stable as we want

173
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:03,219
I am NOT going to into the procedural

174
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,530
questions of the UN GTE and open-ended

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,690
working group and zone but I just would

176
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,819
like to understand how many of you have

177
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:15,750
not heard the short version of UN group

178
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,270
of governmental experts or you and GG so

179
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:25,830
know everybody has heard of this good

180
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:29,710
it's an expert audience you know that

181
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,650
2013 and 2015 reports of the GG were

182
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:37,090
quite successful we had been able to

183
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:40,180
agree on set of norms and set of

184
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,310
principles at very at the highest level

185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:48,099
at a global level endorsed by the

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:51,339
General Assembly the 2013 report has

187
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,040
resulted with notion that states should

188
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:58,300
adhere to the existing international law

189
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,370
and this is not disputed this is still

190
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,280
there there is an agreement that states

191
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:09,010
are holding up international law also in

192
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:12,130
cyber domain the 2015 report however did

193
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:15,490
not state so strongly anymore that the

194
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,830
IHL and UN Charter apply but it was

195
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,630
written that principles of international

196
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:26,650
law of line and as we know 2016-2017

197
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,870
report did not succeed in consensus

198
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,560
because of the question of international

199
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,260
law and the question of international

200
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,930
law is out there also this time around

201
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:43,439
when we start discussions in New York

202
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:48,719
this December within the new Gigi

203
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:52,240
therefore there international law

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,990
possibly will be the hot debated issue

205
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,450
for five to six years to come

206
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,940
also after this cycle of the GG and

207
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,430
maybe even we will have new cycles in

208
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:08,260
the UN we do not know how the UN process

209
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:10,479
goes and what could be what we can do in

210
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,720
in order to provide to this debate is

211
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480
maybe not to get fixated on specific

212
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,880
processes in the UN or anywhere else in

213
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,770
international organizations but

214
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,200
encourage countries around the world to

215
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:26,860
understand more how the international

216
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,670
law applies and how exactly different

217
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,970
nations are translating the existing

218
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,939
international law into cyber domain you

219
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,810
have heard the Estonian views our

220
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,960
president presented and we have heard

221
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,000
the views of many other NATO allies on

222
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,890
this also some like-minded countries

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,980
like Australia and I think these are the

224
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,890
first good steps and these steps should

225
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,080
be taken forward of course what we can

226
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:02,530
do is to encourage more nations to come

227
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,480
up with some interpretation of how they

228
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,540
see the principles of international law

229
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,050
apply in cyberspace and of course we are

230
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,610
here in Tallinn and we all have been

231
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,859
reading Tallinn manual I am sure that

232
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,460
there is no person in the audience who

233
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,230
hasn't heard about to tell in manual and

234
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,410
Tallinn manual still remains the most

235
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,860
authoritative academic analysis on this

236
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,829
issue

237
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:31,540
helping however many nations around the

238
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:35,890
world to understand the basics so it has

239
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:41,380
a textbook value which we possibly have

240
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:44,980
to appreciate and in addition to to tell

241
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,120
in manual efforts our national efforts

242
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,430
in order to interpret and analyze

243
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,620
international law and principles that we

244
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,109
then would follow in our cyber

245
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:00,200
operations or in our response to cyber

246
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:04,400
operations are as important as the

247
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:10,820
legal principles set in them in the more

248
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,610
academic texts what possibly we have to

249
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,370
now look at when we talk about

250
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:23,320
international law or a couple of

251
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:26,260
questions and each nation has somehow

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,560
figured out on their own how these

253
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,200
questions could be taken forward so

254
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,619
there is a question of sovereignty we do

255
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,620
not know exactly how we are dealing with

256
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:46,550
sovereignty in cyberspace and the UN GT

257
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:48,530
report in 2013 is saying that the UN the

258
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,780
international law applies especially UN

259
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:56,510
Charter for some nations the sovereignty

260
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,390
was the Keystone in this UN Charter

261
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,050
there and for some other nations

262
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,990
it was the self collective self-defense

263
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:08,120
so it's in a way good that the UN

264
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,770
Charter is such a broad text that it

265
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,410
allows us to analyze those concepts from

266
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,819
so different angles but whereas the

267
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,839
western side was thinking about

268
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,310
collective self-defense some Algerian

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,380
countries clearly thought that

270
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,599
sovereignty and non interference to

271
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,980
internal affairs was the value in this

272
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,910
statement the other question that still

273
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:38,720
is debated by many nations is that you

274
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,939
diligence principle and what exactly the

275
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,810
nations are supposed to be doing in

276
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,810
order to also fulfill their due

277
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,920
diligence in cyberspace and related to

278
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,949
this we have the issue of capacity

279
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,199
building and helping those nations who

280
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:01,940
cannot help themselves and to make sure

281
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:06,290
that we are able to have cooperation in

282
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,440
investigations with as many countries as

283
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,959
possible and and there are a couple of

284
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,550
other issues where nations are still and

285
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,570
trying to figure out how they are

286
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,069
approaching this when the Estonian legal

287
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,270
experts got together and put these

288
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:26,000
Estonian ideas on the paper

289
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,900
it wasn't easy even in such a small

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,950
ecosystem as we have here so I can

291
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,240
imagine what it means for larger

292
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:39,860
countries where you have armies of

293
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,580
lawyers and armies of cyber experts even

294
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:46,660
in a small country you will you will

295
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:49,970
have the debates and discussions and and

296
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:54,560
many many sequences of meetings on this

297
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:57,050
issue so and the glass is half-full as I

298
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,869
said the understanding of international

299
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,240
law is there we have made the beginning

300
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,940
we have made also the beginning in terms

301
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,170
of trust building and

302
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,360
confidence-building measures we have the

303
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,209
regional confidence-building measures we

304
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,660
have the elementary normative framework

305
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:17,720
actually set and now the question is how

306
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:21,199
we implement it how we are going to

307
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,589
enforce the GT norms the CBMs and

308
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,970
existing international law there are

309
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:31,370
several paths of activities how we can

310
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,040
do it and more efficiently and how we

311
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,240
can start imposing

312
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,579
also consequences for those who are not

313
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,190
holding up international law or

314
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,510
following the norms so there are some

315
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,410
initiatives amongst like-minded

316
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:51,610
countries also both EU and NATO have

317
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,890
come up with their own policy response

318
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,370
frameworks in order to make sure that

319
00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:01,790
the perpetrators in cyberspace will not

320
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,720
stay unpunished the EU cyber diplomacy

321
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:08,959
toolbox which is now widely quoted by

322
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,670
many cyber experts and not only cyber

323
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,140
experts but also the political leaders

324
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,839
is foreseeing many state

325
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:20,040
and activities in order to respond to

326
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,480
the cyber operations we have statesman's

327
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,859
we have declarations we have a joint

328
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,530
attribution statement possibilities and

329
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,590
very importantly finally we have the

330
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:35,220
sanctions regime agreed amongst all 28

331
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,549
nations to be applicable in in case of

332
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,360
cyber domain and we would like to see

333
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:44,429
now to also make sure that some of those

334
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,309
sanctions materialized that our

335
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:49,590
sanctions regime or sanctions framework

336
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:53,090
which was adopted few weeks ago allows

337
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,740
us to do within NATO we have the

338
00:17:53,090 --> 00:18:00,870
guidelines on operations below the

339
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:03,059
threshold of armed attack and all the

340
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,678
steps what the NATO nations have been

341
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,690
doing in order to achieve a more

342
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,120
coherent understanding of this issue and

343
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,510
also setting up the mechanisms in order

344
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,000
to implement should be going forward and

345
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,929
of course we have also term other

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,669
like-minded activities with a group of

347
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:25,260
countries which are sharing the same

348
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:29,750
values of free and open Internet and and

349
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:32,700
making sure that we are holding up the

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,660
international law and the norms based

351
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,660
international order in the cyber domain

352
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,890
so I think we are going to see more of

353
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:47,070
these activities in the future either in

354
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,840
unite or amongst like-minded we of

355
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,939
course also putting a lot of effort

356
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,399
these days on the UN processes

357
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,880
especially we should keep in mind their

358
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,970
need for more capacity building for the

359
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,490
countries that might not have the same

360
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,660
level of maturity as we have if you want

361
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:08,460
to collaborate in even cyber crime

362
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,860
investigations or or any other cyber

363
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,270
issue with some of the developing

364
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,240
nations we have to make sure that they

365
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,370
have the basic infrastructure and basic

366
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,020
organizational and legal ability in

367
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,020
place in order to respond and

368
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,690
I think from academic perspective I've

369
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:32,770
I'm very keen to hear all the debates

370
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,870
that saikhan on international law

371
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,270
applying and how exactly this or that

372
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:42,010
principle applies but I also would

373
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:44,710
encourage more policymaking crowd and

374
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,840
political people even if you don't know

375
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,549
exactly how this law applies and what is

376
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,110
to diligence means and because you know

377
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,480
we are not the lawyers we don't know

378
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,370
really all these questions but it's

379
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,440
important that we go out and say yes

380
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,330
blue applies I know how and I have

381
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,730
experts at home Hotel how so

382
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,139
and I think this boldness is already

383
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,780
something that we have to present

384
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:13,620
especially in the upcoming UN debates so

385
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:17,980
thank you thank you very much telly and

386
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,809
for for your view on tour representation

387
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,730
of the of the Estonian positions but

388
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:25,928
also emphasizing the the aspect of

389
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,990
capacity building not only understanding

390
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,780
and and sort of substantiating over you

391
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,659
and our views and positions and in terms

392
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,389
of applicable law and I I particularly

393
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,940
enjoyed your sort of or the parallel I

394
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:43,059
made this from your speech was the

395
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,830
states have gotten a hold of the menu of

396
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:46,658
the options that are available to them

397
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,299
in terms of international law but they

398
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,880
are struggling with with figuring out

399
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:56,049
what the implications of a selection of

400
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,360
a particular menu item or course will be

401
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,210
in terms of their future activity and

402
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,270
their own that sort of balancing action

403
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,330
from from other other qualities and I

404
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,510
definitely let you echo her call for the

405
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,820
police community to to voiced

406
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:16,020
voiced their concerns and and they are

407
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:19,060
interesting they're desirable objectives

408
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,639
in what they what they see where they

409
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:25,870
would like to go within within the

410
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,170
limits of international law so next up

411
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,510
it's over to you Nicolas and we look

412
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,850
forward to you presenting your your

413
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,820
paper and your findings on the role of

414
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,209
international organizations or regional

415
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:44,490
organizations in international stability

416
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,490
negotiations the stage is yours

417
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,450
all right good afternoon everyone it's a

418
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,689
real pleasure and honor to be here today

419
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:04,080
amongst so many cyber folks and cyber

420
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,500
experts so that's a true honor thank you

421
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,300
for that but the big thank you doesn't

422
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,640
only go to the organizers and the hosts

423
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,700
of this Bandits but especially to my

424
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,640
co-author of this paper because without

425
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,620
her this paper would have never gotten

426
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,070
published and never received the quality

427
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,629
that I think we have achieved so right

428
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,889
at the outset a special shout-out to

429
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,940
Anna Maria Lucilla for her tremendous

430
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,400
contribution to this paper if you ever

431
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,620
looking for some advice on international

432
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:41,850
law and how it applies to some of the

433
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:46,709
policy discussions reach out to her in

434
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:48,000
the back let me at the outset say that

435
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,050
even though I work for the Organization

436
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,210
for Security and Cooperation in Europe

437
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,960
and that covers parts of my paper this

438
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,570
presentation of course also the

439
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,850
publication reflects our own views our

440
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,429
own analysis so if there's questions

441
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,320
sort of on the OEC involvement I'm happy

442
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,850
to put on my OEC hat later on during the

443
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:14,429
Q&A but the presentation itself sort of

444
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:17,250
reflects my own opinion so let me start

445
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,250
up by underlying that the UN continues

446
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,630
to play a central role in exploring how

447
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,890
greater cyber stability can be achieved

448
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,260
on an international level

449
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,310
no other platform has managed to produce

450
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,100
such overarching recommendations that

451
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:34,320
Haley just mentioned and therefore the

452
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,260
big question is why should we care about

453
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,520
regional musicians efforts in this field

454
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,150
what are their even doing the house D

455
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,090
connections with to international

456
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,470
discussions on the UN level and so right

457
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,250
at the outset let me make this clear

458
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,960
that the experience in confidence

459
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,850
building measures capacity building and

460
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,180
other related efforts in these

461
00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:00,060
respective regions are quite noteworthy

462
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,830
moreover there's two key buzzwords here

463
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,700
that I would like you to take away with

464
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,250
today

465
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,160
one of them is incubator

466
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,890
the other one is implementer what I mean

467
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,480
with that is that a regional

468
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,850
organization is quite often serve as an

469
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,070
incubator for new ideas and practical

470
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,820
efforts that relate to international law

471
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:24,280
and norms development states enjoy the

472
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:28,409
opportunity to test out play around

473
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,910
options texts non papers certain

474
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,370
workshop series in a regional setting

475
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,170
and if it works and might be elevated on

476
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,669
an international level or they might be

477
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,270
other procedures and following up upon

478
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,260
that and that's quite a good thing to

479
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,550
have because not everything

480
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,110
automatically has to fly on

481
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,570
international level not everything sort

482
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:49,419
of is scalable in that sense so having

483
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,179
regional organizations in providing this

484
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,670
space is quite useful but on the other

485
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,560
side they also serve as an implementer

486
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,050
of the globally accepted agreements like

487
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,300
the GTA report so we already see already

488
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,270
there's sort of a back and forth between

489
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,760
these two layers because in the N region

490
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,500
organizations turn these UN

491
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,560
recommendations into reality in that

492
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,820
sense they they sometimes figure out how

493
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,780
to attach very practical means to the

494
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,620
agreements that are made either through

495
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,690
dgg reports or other means the GG

496
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,679
acknowledged that in 2015 and I think

497
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:28,480
the very latest UN GT resolution well

498
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,460
the resolution that so created the new

499
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,190
GG also makes it very clear with this

500
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,980
new regional consultation process that

501
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,050
it's about to kick off that there is a

502
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,320
role for regional organisations in this

503
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,570
field so based on these observations I'd

504
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,330
like to use my introductory remarks to

505
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,220
address two things one how regional

506
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,580
organisations can contribute to the new

507
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,170
gge and to how regional organisations

508
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,740
can improve the cooperation amongst

509
00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:00,370
themselves so as a start let us quickly

510
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:03,220
recap the four pillar approach of the

511
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,689
gge report we have norms rules and

512
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,950
principles of run schools responsible

513
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,020
state behavior we have

514
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,700
confidence-building measures we have

515
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,190
international cooperation and assistance

516
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,710
and ICT security and capacity building

517
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,590
and the applicability of international

518
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,570
and use of ICTs and it's important to

519
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,490
look at the interconnectedness of these

520
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,220
four pillars because there's different

521
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,450
themes that are actually connecting the

522
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,850
global agreements with regional efforts

523
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,350
what I mean with this is norms to a

524
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,899
certain extent need to be socialized

525
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,500
they need to be put into practice and

526
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,020
for example CBMs are a nice way to to

527
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,560
actually take care of that so what I

528
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,020
mean by this is if a norm is there to

529
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,470
clarify what she'll and shall not be

530
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:54,490
done a CBM can clarify how certain norm

531
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,900
is incorporated into state practice so

532
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,190
you already see there's just this

533
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,170
inherent connection on sort of a larger

534
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,280
level and then how you actually follow

535
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,810
up on it in a practical level similarly

536
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,510
several confidence-building measures are

537
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,580
designed to keep communications channels

538
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,910
open to connect States with each other

539
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,080
so this is a nice fallback in case

540
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,680
enormous are broken you know they

541
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,560
deserve a sort of a a mechanism - that

542
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,800
kicks in then when certain norm is not

543
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,210
respected and then thirdly also when you

544
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,620
look at capacity building if states

545
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,860
don't have the capacity to engage in

546
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,350
cyber stability mechanisms you know

547
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,179
focus needs to be put on building up

548
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,550
their national capacities so that they

549
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,350
become that they can become an active

550
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,740
contributor and increase their

551
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,300
international engagement efforts as some

552
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,010
of you might know the OSC currently

553
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,500
places special emphasis on implementing

554
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,140
the already agreed-upon CBMs within the

555
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,390
OSCE region and so when the UN GA

556
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,120
resolution on a new gge was passed

557
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,970
I personally wondered how can regional

558
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,979
efforts and these global negotiations

559
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,780
reinforce each other and make use of the

560
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,090
existing procedures and agreements in

561
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,580
the practical and of constructive outset

562
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,800
and so after some preliminary research

563
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,840
annamaria and I were convinced that the

564
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,540
upcoming series of UN negotiations and

565
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,459
the final reports of both working groups

566
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,649
could significantly benefit from

567
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,240
increased collaboration with regional

568
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,990
organisations let us not forget that

569
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,820
regionalization have developed their own

570
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,200
innovative ideas

571
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,310
and how to address some of the most

572
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,620
pertinent international cybersecurity

573
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,409
policy challenges so now you might

574
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,360
wonder what is the exact benefit of a

575
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:44,440
stronger collaboration what's what's the

576
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,750
point and so in our paper we argue and

577
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,730
present several options and

578
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,910
possibilities and I'm going to focus on

579
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:55,180
on four of those today in my in my

580
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,040
remarks to give you some of an idea and

581
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,910
a flavor of the possibilities for

582
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,980
enhanced collaboration and enhanced

583
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,230
effectiveness of their efforts so in the

584
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,780
one hand we have more effective and

585
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,610
targeted norm development on the other

586
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,110
hand we have faster implementation

587
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,830
procedures on the regional and national

588
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,229
level we also believe that it could

589
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,590
cause could lead to more coherent inter

590
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,030
regional collaboration and to more

591
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,389
effective capacity-building and

592
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,500
awareness building so what does this

593
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,650
mean concrete terms

594
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,750
for example collaboration between the UN

595
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,210
and regional organizations could lead to

596
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,130
a development of a clear framework for

597
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,590
enhancing the positive mutually

598
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:44,200
reinforcing impact of global and

599
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:51,580
regional efforts and such a work plan or

600
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:54,550
roadmap could easily be harmonized to

601
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,850
brought together so for example when the

602
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:00,280
DGE limiting norm that states that

603
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,199
states should not knowingly allow their

604
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,290
territory to be used for internationally

605
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,970
wrongful acts using ICTs when you when

606
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,310
you look at that language it has clear

607
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,680
connections to both national capacities

608
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,590
to address national to address malicious

609
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,510
or criminal use of ICT infrastructure

610
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,669
but there's also this area is also

611
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,650
covered by for example asean who is very

612
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,710
active was been very active in the past

613
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,900
years in this particular field and the

614
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,420
OEC is dressing this issue by workshop

615
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,700
series as well another example would be

616
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,950
the norm on that states should not

617
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,780
conduct or knowingly support ICT

618
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,210
activity that intentionally damages

619
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,970
critical infrastructure this nicely

620
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,049
neatly aligns with multiple critical

621
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,970
infrastructure protection

622
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:47,080
efforts such as the CBM 15 of the OSE or

623
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,450
the Organization of American States

624
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,449
capacity building workshops on this

625
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,369
particular matter

626
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,039
another potential benefit of increased

627
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:59,350
regional and global cooperation lies in

628
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,590
the effective follow-up work on the

629
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,139
regional level if a certain initiative

630
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,789
is included in the gge process without

631
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,889
including regional organizations

632
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,110
considerations it might prove difficult

633
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:13,508
for region organizations to follow up if

634
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,090
their mandates to not do not overlap

635
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:17,859
with the initiative of hand so having

636
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,988
regional organizations to be part of the

637
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,029
framing procedure could prove quite

638
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:25,899
helpful in preparing a regional

639
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:27,759
follow-up projects when looking at the

640
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:29,738
coherence between GE reports and

641
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,929
regional innovations activities there's

642
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:34,359
significant potential in lining them up

643
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,999
for example through a joint work plan or

644
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:41,639
regional roadmaps which could be annexed

645
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:44,619
to the new working group reports these

646
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:46,629
roadmaps may include guidance and

647
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:48,459
recommendations on regional

648
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:51,039
implementation that is tailored to

649
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,320
respective components and considerations

650
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,629
for within these regions themselves and

651
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,029
so having regional organizations in the

652
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:59,949
GTE jointly developed these documents

653
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:02,350
could significantly improve the

654
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,529
implementation process and also the

655
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,178
overall impact of the new reports

656
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,820
regional organizations especially those

657
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,559
with national offices and national

658
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,049
capacity-building efforts have extensive

659
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,908
insight into both national concerns but

660
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,379
also regional trends similarities

661
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:19,899
differences and possibilities for

662
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:22,689
collaboration so they can therefore

663
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:24,850
clarify how the newly proposed UN

664
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,720
priorities line up best with both

665
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:30,248
national priorities and regional trends

666
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,649
so having conducted capacity-building

667
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:35,080
and norm and CBM implantation for many

668
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:37,689
years this is an area where the UN can

669
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,109
profit significantly from regional

670
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,029
expertise similarly regional

671
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,889
organizations have developed their own

672
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:47,109
innovative concepts in the past years

673
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:49,678
that might be applicable to the global

674
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,678
level as well

675
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,460
for example the OEC has something called

676
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:58,380
the DIA depth a CBM initiative

677
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,789
yes we're no longer adapting children

678
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,480
were now adapting confidence-building

679
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:05,520
measures which means that states who

680
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,770
feel particularly committed and strong

681
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:15,168
about a certain CBM can then push for

682
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:17,730
further implementation usage and and

683
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:20,669
connect that to practical ideas and in

684
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,140
envisions how they believe the

685
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,120
respective confidence-building measure

686
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,640
could best be used applied or further

687
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,090
enhanced and this could this concept

688
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,010
could easily be applied also to to norms

689
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,949
so there could be a targeted norm

690
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,929
campaign driven by volunteer states that

691
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,929
now might provide new room for

692
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,750
suggestions on how norms can be best

693
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,380
applied and implemented an

694
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,480
implementation is something where

695
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,370
regionalization x' can make use of their

696
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,520
extensive national and sub region

697
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,709
network as i just mentioned so having

698
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,870
these organizations here all of them

699
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,140
have great logos by the way so that's I

700
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:00,779
couldn't resist we'll put them up there

701
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,460
this is something where it's really

702
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,840
worth looking into what these

703
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,110
organizations have done and and

704
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,790
critically reflect how we can make use

705
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,009
of these existing experiences and

706
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,989
expertise now when it comes to the

707
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:17,909
second question on inter regional

708
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:19,020
collaboration we in our research notice

709
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,970
that there's a lot of potential for

710
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,449
inter regional collaboration amongst

711
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:27,178
these regional organizations so these

712
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:29,098
and many other organizations worldwide

713
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,540
are keen on contributing to the

714
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,659
enhancement of international cyber

715
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,399
diplomacy efforts either through their

716
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,159
CBM efforts or capacity-building

717
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,469
initiatives there their dialogues that

718
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,629
they're fostering there's a wide array

719
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:47,279
of possibilities that they have designed

720
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:49,918
for their own interests and purposes at

721
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,919
the OEC we tried to engage in this

722
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:56,009
conversation through an inter-regional

723
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:59,730
conference two years ago with our

724
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,990
partners in Korea and Seoul and this was

725
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,090
actually quite an interesting exercise

726
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,529
to to meet up in Seoul and

727
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,090
see what the similarities and

728
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,060
differences are between the Asian region

729
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:11,340
and the OEC region see how we can

730
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,680
support each other and figure out House

731
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,770
of the contributions from a regional

732
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,690
perspective toward international cyber

733
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,430
stability efforts can be enhanced how

734
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,360
can how can we can learn from each other

735
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:26,370
we conducted the same sort of exercise

736
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,010
this year again just a few weeks ago and

737
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,779
in Korea and yet again it really goes to

738
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,270
show that it's quite it's quite

739
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,420
interesting to bring experts from these

740
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,009
different regions together not just to

741
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,870
share the different perception but to

742
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,410
really figure out ok how can we sort of

743
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,100
take advantage of the unique

744
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,379
characteristics of regional

745
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:50,270
organizations and regional efforts that

746
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:52,200
are taking place however in order to

747
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,590
understand the similarities and

748
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,700
differences and make room for potential

749
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,320
collaboration amongst regional

750
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,169
organizations working on cybersecurity

751
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,600
issues the right platform and format

752
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,370
needs to be entered identified and so

753
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,589
maybe instead of leaving it to regional

754
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,830
organizations themselves a third party

755
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,690
platform like a UN agency might be one

756
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,270
to bring actors together on a regular

757
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:18,660
basis and to facilitate such an exchange

758
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,130
on a more structural long-term plan so

759
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,830
once established an inter-regional

760
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,510
collaboration would facilitate a gaining

761
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,520
specific insight on related

762
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,380
cybersecurity initiatives by other

763
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,900
international organizations so

764
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,600
additionally there's a potential to

765
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,430
really maximize the impact on

766
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,680
overlapping activities we always speak

767
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,049
about avoiding duplication of efforts

768
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,580
but I mean they do exists especially

769
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,100
across the regions but it's not

770
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,140
necessarily a bad thing you know

771
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,910
seeing how similar initiatives or

772
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,410
workshops are conducted across the

773
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,629
regions might prove to be quite helpful

774
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,879
interesting and maybe there's even room

775
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,390
for collaborating and planning joint

776
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,150
workshops trainings or even conferences

777
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:02,520
and lastly maybe the above-mentioned

778
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,650
regional implementation roadmaps could

779
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,480
be accompanied by a un-led cyber

780
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,210
capacity building initiative

781
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,580
specifically designed to diplomacy norm

782
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,920
and CPM matters in cyberspace this is

783
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,170
not to like completely scrap away

784
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,750
existing capacity-building efforts but

785
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,550
to figure

786
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,160
how sort of the services that are

787
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,400
provided across the regions by variety

788
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:28,830
effectors can sort of be lined up and

789
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:32,500
potentially be increase their their own

790
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:35,740
positive effects seeing how how things

791
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,290
work out which procedures are effective

792
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,209
what kind of training components work

793
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,480
especially well when we look at norm

794
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,090
implantation or going through scenarios

795
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,010
to figure out how states can make best

796
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,790
use of the existing international legal

797
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:54,460
structures so I hope this gives you some

798
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,920
inspiration for the upcoming diplomacy

799
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,280
negotiations for those of you who will

800
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,540
actually be evolved in the GG

801
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,710
negotiations please consider our

802
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,560
proposals

803
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:08,410
we're not territorial about the ideas so

804
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,990
please make use of them we won't charge

805
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,700
you a fee there's not going to be a

806
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:16,089
copyright infringement we always

807
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,319
appreciate a reference but overall thank

808
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:20,040
you very much for your attention and I

809
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,040
look forward to your questions

810
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,720
thanks very much Nikolas and Anna Maria

811
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,149
for your for your excellent paper and

812
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,580
for the for the presentation I think you

813
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,530
really made a compelling case for the

814
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,130
benefits of the collaboration of global

815
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:41,320
norms platforms with regional

816
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:43,330
organizations and in particular looking

817
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,930
beyond the immediate outcome of a

818
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:49,840
particular sort of a platform or of the

819
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,790
UN Gigi or open-ended working group and

820
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:56,260
looking into the long-term or systemic

821
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:58,960
and and perhaps more substantial norm

822
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,850
adherence and implementation so I know

823
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,380
that I'm eating my own words I forgot to

824
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:09,610
give you a chance to to ask questions of

825
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:12,580
Haley so in order not to discriminate

826
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,650
against any other speakers I hope we are

827
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:19,000
urk if we leave the questions towards

828
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:22,480
they towards the end and then with that

829
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,430
said I'm happy to give the floor and

830
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,940
turned on microphone over to mr. Stefano

831
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:30,169
manner

832
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,420
thank you very much thank you oh thank

833
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,820
you sir good afternoon everyone first of

834
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,430
all I would like to thank the Center for

835
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,160
inviting me it's a great honor and

836
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:43,250
privilege for me just a year today and

837
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,100
speak with you about the role of g7

838
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:49,100
States in promoting security and

839
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,890
stability in cyberspace first of all the

840
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,860
spite is not broadly accepted that

841
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,920
international law applies to cyberspace

842
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,380
and that this absolutely relevant

843
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,170
objective was the product of G our work

844
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,360
made inside of some international

845
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,420
organization like for example the United

846
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,510
Nation it seems to me that the majority

847
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,600
of states still prefer a bilateral and

848
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,640
direct approach to diplomatic relations

849
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,110
instead of multilateral agreements

850
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,560
especially when we talk about

851
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:24,580
cybersecurity this is the main reason

852
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,730
for it is because bilateral relations

853
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:31,130
offers a more advantages if compared to

854
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:34,300
multilateral approach approaches also

855
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:37,280
and especially when a topic affects

856
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,440
jurisdiction and culture very different

857
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,970
from each other as is the case with

858
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,880
cybersecurity

859
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:47,230
by way of X by way of example a

860
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,930
bilateral agreement allows a state to

861
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:53,930
choose the other state to enter into a

862
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:56,540
diplomatic relation with instead of

863
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,509
begin forced to negotiate with a vast

864
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,420
number of states this is a very relevant

865
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:07,540
map on table advantage as it enables

866
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:10,880
States to God the duties they willing to

867
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,730
abide by based on the specific

868
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,890
historical moment and the counterparties

869
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,260
feature and this never happens in

870
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:22,279
multilateral multilateral relations

871
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:24,980
since all the actors must be taken

872
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,790
mutual responsibility toward a vast

873
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:32,120
number of states furthermore bilateral

874
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:33,800
agreements are usually much easier to be

875
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,330
negotiated

876
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,270
and can also be kept more easily can

877
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:44,630
also be kept secret mozzie more easily

878
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,060
than multilateral one this represents a

879
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,690
greatly appealing feature in my point of

880
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,880
view notably

881
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,970
when the subjects deal with are

882
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,090
particularly sensible for example such

883
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:59,240
as military and intelligence topics in

884
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:02,570
addition bilateral agreements can also

885
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,750
be much more detail than multilateral

886
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:09,320
ones particularly regarding the rights

887
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:11,780
and duties a state commits to take on

888
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,540
the diplomatic and political level

889
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,470
on the contrary multilateral agreement

890
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,410
due to their own nature cannot be

891
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:24,140
focused on gaining broad consensus on

892
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:25,310
principles often consider to I in

893
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,819
general

894
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:31,400
lastly the latter agreements can be

895
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,700
easily changed according to the future

896
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,680
needs and rapid evolution technological

897
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,240
evolution of this of the scenario for

898
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:44,149
example so unfortunately currently all

899
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,189
state seems they prefer bilateral

900
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,740
agreements and direct state state

901
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,200
dialogues instead of multilateral

902
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,729
approaches within international

903
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,450
organization also when the topic is

904
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:58,640
cybersecurity and this is a problem

905
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:02,600
because in my point of view it is very

906
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:07,370
relevant to underline the importance of

907
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:10,310
the initiatives driven by state regional

908
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:13,190
and international organization and the

909
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,799
private sector to promote non-binding

910
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,600
international norm on responsible

911
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,690
conduct for the security and stability

912
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,650
in cyberspace this is because for

913
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:26,300
example building a real and effective

914
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:29,060
deterrent strategy deterrence cyber

915
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,300
strategy is also based on the

916
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,670
possibility to publicly condemning at

917
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:38,090
international level the conduct of a

918
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:40,370
state and subsequently to sanctioning

919
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:43,190
those cyber activities that violate

920
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:46,549
European and international law

921
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,570
principles especially if the state

922
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,830
responsible

923
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:54,800
the attack adhered to these principles

924
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:56,860
truth commitments made in European form

925
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,140
for example and within international

926
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:03,110
organization this is the case for

927
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:05,990
example of last week decision of the

928
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:10,510
European Union Council the number is

929
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:13,250
seven nine six of 2019 concerning

930
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:16,130
restrictive measures against

931
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,650
cyberattacks threatening the European

932
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,470
Union or its member states by which

933
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:25,930
European Union can now decide to throw

934
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:31,370
them all funds and economic resources

935
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:34,640
below into own L or control it by any

936
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:38,270
natural or legal person entity or body

937
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,690
that made or attempted to made a

938
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:44,180
cyberattack with significant effect

939
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:47,930
against the European Union or its member

940
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,270
state so from this point of view in

941
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:53,049
addition to what has already being

942
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:57,080
analyzed by the distinguished speaker

943
00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:00,290
before we cannot omit my point of view

944
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,590
the role played in the last year by the

945
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:05,930
g7 states that is the informal forum for

946
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,540
international cooperation between the

947
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:11,390
most industrialized countries in the

948
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:14,029
world that are Canada France Germany

949
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:17,660
Italy Japan United Kingdom and the

950
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:21,230
United States that for instance in 2016

951
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:25,640
through a document completely dedicated

952
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:27,830
to the topic of cybersecurity named g7

953
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,859
principle in action on cyber as

954
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:34,370
underlined the paramount importance that

955
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,860
cyberspace mass increasingly have in the

956
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:40,759
political agenda of each government and

957
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,580
each state furthermore among the various

958
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,730
commitments undertaking is this doll in

959
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:51,740
this document by the g7 states in

960
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:54,200
addition to an always sorry in and

961
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:57,109
always in addition to an always

962
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:00,290
decidable reaffirmation of the principle

963
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,700
aimed as of guarding for example data

964
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,900
protection private

965
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:08,529
and also the human rights as well has

966
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:11,180
the cooperation and information sharing

967
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,240
for the fight against terrorism and

968
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,549
cyber crime by States what is in my

969
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,000
point of view certain striking is the

970
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:23,030
explicit recognition of the possibility

971
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,910
that in certain cases cyber attacks may

972
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,700
be qualified as a useless force or as a

973
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:31,359
normal attack and that from this dissent

974
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,220
the right of states to self-defense both

975
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,890
individually and collectively provided

976
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,620
for in article 51 of the charter of the

977
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,710
net of the United Nation this

978
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,900
recognition in my point of view show

979
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,630
shows how much the strategic approach of

980
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,930
the main powers is changing over the

981
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:54,080
time from a mere cyber defense posture

982
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:56,660
to a real development of offensive

983
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:00,710
capabilities in and through cyberspace

984
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:03,170
all these however without clear strategy

985
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:06,770
on this issue having been consolidated

986
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:08,540
within international bodies and above

987
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,259
all without an international framework

988
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:14,330
of global share and accepted standards

989
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,900
for the use of offensive cyberspace

990
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:19,520
operation at least at the moment

991
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:22,330
moreover in my point of view it is

992
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,190
precisely the issues of standard and

993
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:28,220
essential legitimacy of the conduct of

994
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,310
States in and through cyberspace that

995
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:36,410
are at the earth of the subsequent

996
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:38,990
document of 2017 and 2019 naming

997
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,270
respectively g7 declaration of

998
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:45,200
responsible state behavior in cyberspace

999
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:49,030
and Dennard declaration on the cyber nor

1000
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,750
initiative what is a declaration in fact

1001
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:55,940
firmly I lied the applicability of

1002
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:58,520
international law and in particularly of

1003
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,010
the United Nations Charter also to the

1004
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,370
cyberspace domain in order to maintain

1005
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:08,030
peace stability and above all to promote

1006
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:10,859
an open safe secure stable accessible

1007
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,319
and peaceful cyberspace

1008
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:16,839
in particular the resident the recent

1009
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,859
dinar declaration of the Cybermen or

1010
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:25,029
initiatives commits all the g7 states to

1011
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:27,999
encourage better and increased voluntary

1012
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:30,999
exchange of information among g7 states

1013
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:34,149
and with others on the steps taken to

1014
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:35,890
understand and effectively implement the

1015
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:38,349
voluntary non-binding norm a

1016
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:41,499
recommendation of responsible state

1017
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:44,289
behavior in cyberspace but also to share

1018
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:47,288
the best practices and lesson learned

1019
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:50,529
that will be identified as as a result

1020
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:54,489
of this process with a wide range of

1021
00:48:50,529 --> 00:48:57,159
states and other stakeholders also to

1022
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:59,400
engage with other states to include them

1023
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:02,339
in a peer learning

1024
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,949
cooperative transparency and

1025
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:08,919
confidence-building efforts and the last

1026
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:12,189
one is to cooperate to help build

1027
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:14,709
partners capability to implement the

1028
00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:19,689
both mentionin voluntary non-binding

1029
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:22,509
norms and recommendation in my mind you

1030
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:25,959
it's also interesting to note that g7

1031
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:29,140
leaders had long clearly indicated that

1032
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:33,759
the conclusion of the report of 2010

1033
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:37,890
2013 and 2015 of the UN Gigi should

1034
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:40,359
always serve as a guide for each state

1035
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:43,169
stressing the need to increasingly

1036
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:45,459
enhance international cooperation and

1037
00:49:43,169 --> 00:49:47,979
facilitate the implementation of

1038
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:50,469
confidence-building measures aimed at

1039
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:52,479
reducing the risk of country to arising

1040
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:55,349
from the use of information and

1041
00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:59,529
communication communication technology

1042
00:49:55,349 --> 00:50:03,369
furthermore at least at the present time

1043
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:06,999
I see that the France France seems to be

1044
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:09,640
the most active European country with

1045
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:12,729
regard to the development of diplomatic

1046
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,969
dialogue about cybersecurity as you know

1047
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:19,058
in mid-november of the last year in fact

1048
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:21,880
for with the outcomes of the Internet

1049
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:25,040
Governance forum in Paris

1050
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,560
French diplomacy took the lead proposing

1051
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,089
the call for trust and security in

1052
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:35,119
cyberspace that is a an initiative aimed

1053
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:37,970
at creating a common consensus at

1054
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,280
international level on certain rules of

1055
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:43,629
conduct of states with regard to cyber

1056
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:47,060
security and internet from protecting

1057
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:49,550
citizen critical infrastructure the

1058
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,920
supply chain and the voting system also

1059
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:55,310
from cyberattack designed to cause

1060
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,560
significant damages to the promotion and

1061
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,259
implementation of confidence-building

1062
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:04,099
measure for cyberspace between states

1063
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:07,730
and very very relevant the prevention of

1064
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:12,920
forms of a kimbuck by non-state actors

1065
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:15,380
and private companies and it is clear

1066
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,960
for me that the document presented by

1067
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,780
president McCrone is a commendable

1068
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,990
attempt to keep political and public

1069
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,400
attention on this issue and the French

1070
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,839
cultural trust and security in

1071
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:32,720
cyberspace has been welcomed more than

1072
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:35,660
positively by States and by some of the

1073
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:40,669
major multinational companies in fact

1074
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:45,080
today it r66 the states that have joined

1075
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:49,130
this initiative 139 the international

1076
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,950
civil society organization and 347

1077
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,830
entities of the private sector both from

1078
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:57,379
the world of technology and security and

1079
00:51:54,830 --> 00:52:03,200
from the world of the provision of the

1080
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:05,869
essential services however in my view we

1081
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:10,368
did this long list of membership more

1082
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:14,510
than the attendances what I see is their

1083
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:17,330
absences that make noise the United

1084
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:20,810
States Russia and China for example are

1085
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:23,119
missing from the subscriber the reasons

1086
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:25,070
that could push the three main power in

1087
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,170
the field of cybersecurity to deal to

1088
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,780
this choice in my view are easily

1089
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:32,240
identified including identifiable first

1090
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,640
of all for example the United States in

1091
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,999
my view has no interest

1092
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,480
in weakening its leadership role in the

1093
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:43,399
development of sectoral policies

1094
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,640
accepting also to recognize French as a

1095
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,880
privileged inter Luke interlocutor at

1096
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,538
the same time Russia and China could not

1097
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,700
have accepted to sign part of the

1098
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:58,069
measures indicated in the French

1099
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,759
document since some of these measures

1100
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:04,038
seems to have been written precisely to

1101
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:08,509
limit those action in cyberspace for

1102
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:11,839
which the West is accusing them for what

1103
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:16,640
I see what is evident in my point of

1104
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:20,210
view is the emergence of proposition for

1105
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,578
concrete commitments at the moment we

1106
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:26,660
need to be be to find ways to be more

1107
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:29,690
practical and more and more concrete on

1108
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:32,618
this topic especially because I see and

1109
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:35,660
in very interesting increase in

1110
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:38,779
multi-stakeholder bottom-up activities

1111
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:42,890
in proposing international norms and so

1112
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:45,230
we have to find ways to involve also the

1113
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,359
private sector and one of the element

1114
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,249
that is in my point I mean my humbly

1115
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,519
point of view very very interesting of

1116
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:55,848
the Paris call is that they involve the

1117
00:53:52,519 --> 00:54:00,529
private sector inside of this of this

1118
00:53:55,849 --> 00:54:04,730
north of this principle sorry in

1119
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:08,390
conclusion I think that we must wonder

1120
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:11,420
whether the flourishing of multilateral

1121
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:13,999
discussion in several contests often

1122
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,489
very distance from each other could not

1123
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:19,669
lead already in the short term to a

1124
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:23,029
dispersion of the efforts of the main

1125
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:24,170
players on international scene this

1126
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:28,519
living room too

1127
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:31,009
immobility and strategic detachment my

1128
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:34,578
personal view is that we must continue

1129
00:54:31,009 --> 00:54:38,089
to push and push again or some of the

1130
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:43,069
most relevant initiative at the at the

1131
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:46,220
inter-regional level such as OSHA g20 g7

1132
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:47,120
ASEAN and so on because then they can

1133
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,330
create

1134
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,210
they are creating the floor for the

1135
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:55,700
consensus consensus on norms and

1136
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:58,430
recommendation that can be used at

1137
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:02,359
international level so for example at

1138
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:05,029
the UN level simultaneously I think that

1139
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:08,060
we must be prepared to control the

1140
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:11,420
flourishing of single or small sorry or

1141
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:14,060
small initiatives to avoid what they say

1142
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:17,180
the mobility and the strategic strategic

1143
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:19,850
detachment of the main national actors

1144
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,690
in the field of cyber security thank you

1145
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,690
very much for your attention

1146
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,989
[Applause]

1147
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:33,500
Thank You Stefano I poke with a question

1148
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,299
here estonia's former president Thomas

1149
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,120
Hendrick Elvis a few years ago on the

1150
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,790
cycling stage proposed the the creation

1151
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:46,190
of a cyber NATO so a coalition of

1152
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:49,580
like-minded countries and the cease DCO

1153
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,560
itself our our the organizing organ

1154
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:54,230
organization here itself has actually

1155
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,049
grown beyond the range of the usual

1156
00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:01,220
suspects of NATO allies and and EU

1157
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:04,130
member states so how successful do you

1158
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:06,589
think such sort of coalitions of the

1159
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:08,930
like-minded not formally in

1160
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,750
international organizations but more

1161
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:15,319
like MOU setups could be to achieving

1162
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:17,180
state commitment to genomes of

1163
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,310
responsible behavior I think that is

1164
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:22,640
fundamental it's a fundamental element

1165
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:25,610
to create the environment to push on

1166
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,690
these norms so we must continue to

1167
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:31,730
creating common consensus on this norm

1168
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:36,050
on these principles on this

1169
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:39,500
recommendation to help at international

1170
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:42,610
level to create the binding norms in the

1171
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,710
future so I think the sort of the the

1172
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:47,990
boiling over of those initiatives beyond

1173
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:50,300
the established international formats is

1174
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:54,560
not only in inevitable but also

1175
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:56,890
necessary in Hampton Thanks well thank

1176
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,630
you for that for the presenters and I'm

1177
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,500
happy to give you all a chance to to

1178
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,930
pick on there

1179
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:06,230
their brains and their insight so we

1180
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:09,859
have a microphone or at least one yes up

1181
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:12,830
here so we already have a question up

1182
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:16,150
front so if you could also please

1183
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:18,740
introduce yourself so the audience knows

1184
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:20,780
okay thank you at Tina Park from the

1185
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,970
NATO Defense College in Rome thank you

1186
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,800
for such interesting presentations I

1187
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:28,339
have different questions for each

1188
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,740
speaker if I may so for ambassador Tara

1189
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:33,290
MacLean I wonder if you could comment on

1190
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,839
the issue of attribution and imposing

1191
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,900
consequences so often when we look at

1192
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,609
some of the major non-state terror

1193
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,220
groups or countries like North Korea

1194
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:46,040
attribution is an issue with their

1195
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,580
cybercrime so we understand generally

1196
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,080
that it's important to impose

1197
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,970
consequences but in the absence of clear

1198
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,840
attribution how do we go about it and

1199
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:59,240
for mr. auda you mentioned them some of

1200
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,550
the joint exercises in training with the

1201
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,319
South Korean government I wonder if you

1202
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,750
are able to share some of the logistical

1203
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,630
aspects and major actors involved

1204
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:11,420
because from the South Korean

1205
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,089
perspective there is clearly a threat

1206
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:16,400
coming from North Korean hackers

1207
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:21,200
especially on critical infrastructure as

1208
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:24,310
well as just prevalence of North Koreans

1209
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:28,040
in different aspects of no South Korean

1210
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:30,830
bureaucracy and a general banking

1211
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,210
industry so if you could comment to the

1212
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,190
extent that you're able what had

1213
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:36,619
happened and if there are prospects for

1214
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:40,790
further collaborations that would be

1215
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:43,040
great into dr. Mele and I have some

1216
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:47,589
questions about the last part of your

1217
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:50,330
presentation and mainly the absence of

1218
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:53,119
agreements and participation from actors

1219
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:56,450
like Russia and China so again knowing

1220
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,950
that countries like Russia and China are

1221
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,890
very important as well as the United

1222
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:02,680
States and enforcing these new norms in

1223
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:05,000
their absence how do we then go about

1224
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:08,569
enforcing these issues because my

1225
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,270
involvement with g8 and g20 countries in

1226
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:12,710
the past it's made me realize compliance

1227
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:14,329
is really the issue you know they will

1228
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,789
come up with great ideas

1229
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:18,650
and yes we could pass another communique

1230
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:20,900
but if they don't follow up with

1231
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:25,039
concrete actions then there's absolutely

1232
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:26,689
no use in passing another declaration so

1233
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,249
based on your experience could you

1234
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:31,339
perhaps the elaborate on how do we move

1235
00:59:28,249 --> 00:59:34,879
forward with the issue of enforcement

1236
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:35,328
thank you so quite a bit of ground to

1237
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,949
cover

1238
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:41,089
Haley would you like to start

1239
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:42,529
attribution is possible first secondly

1240
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:47,089
attribution is possible and first

1241
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:49,670
attribution is possible so otherwise we

1242
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:52,339
wouldn't be able to investigate

1243
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,839
cybercrime if we would say that that

1244
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,739
solution is not possible

1245
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:59,328
it takes time maybe yes it's complex

1246
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:03,410
also when we talk about the attribution

1247
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:06,229
then it consists of the technical bit

1248
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:08,538
but also the political and legal legal

1249
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:11,299
assessment and then eventually it's a

1250
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:14,929
political decision so therefore every

1251
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:19,038
attribution is political so I think many

1252
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:22,359
countries have started to look at their

1253
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:25,099
internal procedures how to attribute

1254
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:28,519
Estonia has put together the attribution

1255
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:31,219
guidelines internally which we also have

1256
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:35,709
shared with our EU and NATO partners and

1257
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:40,160
we see that not many EU and NATO

1258
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:43,609
countries have those have the clear

1259
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:47,058
division of labor internally how they do

1260
01:00:43,609 --> 01:00:49,009
attribution yes but the number is

1261
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:51,579
growing of those countries who are

1262
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:51,579
already

1263
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:58,180
more experienced and mature in this

1264
01:00:55,150 --> 01:01:01,440
field so therefore I think it's it's a

1265
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:05,770
bit of a question of maturity level here

1266
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:09,280
understanding cyberthreats and also it

1267
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:11,259
depends on the technical skills and

1268
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,460
technical capabilities and forensics

1269
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:17,800
capabilities but not only so I think

1270
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:20,560
it's a bit of it's a kind of a complex

1271
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:24,310
issue and each country has to find its

1272
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:27,910
own approach how they attribute but if

1273
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:29,560
we look at the conventional fields of

1274
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,750
attribution I'm quite sure that in the

1275
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,230
beginning of the CBRN you know what

1276
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,230
receiver and

1277
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:40,160
it wasn't so clear either how to

1278
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,870
attribute it exactly but since this

1279
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:45,259
field has been around for such a long

1280
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:47,240
time now nobody's questioning this in

1281
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:51,020
cyber we are not there yet so we just

1282
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,790
have to grow in maturity and and also

1283
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,330
the understanding of different countries

1284
01:01:52,790 --> 01:02:00,860
has to become a bit uniform how exactly

1285
01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:03,950
attribution happens so and I think this

1286
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:06,790
is a process but we have attributed when

1287
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:09,200
a growing group of like-minded countries

1288
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:11,180
has made a collective attribution

1289
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,790
statement attribute in moaña cry to

1290
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,520
North Korea so there it was a state

1291
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:19,279
actor behind we we do not think it was a

1292
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,470
crime group only it was supported by the

1293
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,550
states

1294
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:27,859
it's an old news for me at least

1295
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:31,670
Nicholas thank you for your question on

1296
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:34,640
sort of OAC Korea collaboration it's

1297
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:37,490
worth noting that the OEC has a network

1298
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:40,250
of partners for cooperation that stems

1299
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:42,310
beyond the do ECE region and Korea is

1300
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:45,980
one of them so within that framework

1301
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:47,630
Korea engages with the OIC quite

1302
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,150
extensively and in this particular

1303
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:52,910
matter also not just within Vienna and

1304
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:55,220
our sessions and the diplomatic meetings

1305
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:58,819
was also in a concrete event and

1306
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,950
activity since Korea as you probably

1307
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,950
know is fairly developed an advanced

1308
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:05,689
country and my ITU is floating around

1309
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:08,259
and this is obviously a topic that

1310
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:11,420
they're very much interested in and so

1311
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:13,630
together with the Korean Ministry of

1312
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,280
Foreign Affairs was in the lead and

1313
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:18,260
setting this conference up the OEC

1314
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,350
Secretariat was very happy to have this

1315
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,910
into regional engagement first and

1316
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,380
foremost to really see what the

1317
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,060
similarities and differences are because

1318
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:30,140
of course as you just mentioned North

1319
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:32,810
Korea is considered quite a an issue for

1320
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:36,850
for the Koreans but then at the same

1321
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:38,630
time there's other things that both both

1322
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:43,360
regions have in common

1323
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:45,430
be it so that struggles with how to

1324
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,350
now implement certain technological

1325
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,210
challenges or we look at the

1326
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:52,720
international negotiations we look at

1327
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:54,610
the capacity building and so since the

1328
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,799
ASEAN Regional Forum was also very much

1329
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:59,310
involved in the conference set up this

1330
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,960
helped us to also look at the two

1331
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:03,549
regional organizations efforts in this

1332
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,090
field in particular when it comes to the

1333
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:08,800
norms implementation and the CBMs we

1334
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,640
brought along Thailand as the current

1335
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,010
chair

1336
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,690
Singapore was very much involved so this

1337
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:16,300
is a great opportunity to bring through

1338
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:23,550
the regional stakeholders into one place

1339
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:23,550
and really see how their work lines up

1340
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:33,069
yeah thank you so much for the the

1341
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:34,930
question is it's not quite simple to

1342
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:37,990
answer to your question how to moving

1343
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:42,129
forward after what happened in 2017 at

1344
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:47,379
UN Gigi probably when I see my from my

1345
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:50,890
point of view I think then Russia China

1346
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:53,860
and Cuba in particular opposed in 2017

1347
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:57,220
from the report for a political precise

1348
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:59,140
political approach that is not bided by

1349
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:06,089
the cyberspace but other political

1350
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:11,109
reasons so I think then regional

1351
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:15,490
approaches should be the the right place

1352
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:18,790
to create the consensus to or the floor

1353
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:21,910
to start again at international level

1354
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:24,640
inside the UN to create a common

1355
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:27,240
consensus or recommendation and norms

1356
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,819
but actually has been very difficult

1357
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:35,399
that will it will be realized in the

1358
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:35,400
short term at least thank

1359
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:42,730
thank you very much so more questions

1360
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:46,150
from the floor Oh certainly you were

1361
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:54,940
first the lady in the black in the in

1362
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:57,190
the black key in the back Thank You

1363
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,620
Dominique lizanne ski consultant in

1364
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,150
London I really thank you for your

1365
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,859
presentations all of you are saying

1366
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:05,470
similar things about regional and

1367
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:07,000
like-minded organizations completely

1368
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:09,370
agree with the regional and like-minded

1369
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,770
organizations have been advocating that

1370
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:13,569
for a while I just want to talk about a

1371
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,450
little bit and I just tweeted at Nikolas

1372
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:19,660
briefly about using the UN as a way to

1373
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:22,240
convene or to sort of coordinate one of

1374
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:24,399
the tendencies is the UN is political in

1375
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,740
terms of different agencies and I wanted

1376
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,570
your opinion on the fact that when it

1377
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,390
comes to cybersecurity in cyberspace

1378
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:33,520
those there's more of a tendency to

1379
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:35,529
potentially especially with Russia and

1380
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,300
China to want to be writ towards the

1381
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,790
International Telecommunications Union

1382
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:42,880
and that's something I know our allies

1383
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:44,680
would definitely not want to do so I

1384
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,790
just think I wanted to hear a little bit

1385
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,529
more about maybe thinking about

1386
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:50,320
alternatives or what you think about the

1387
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:52,510
politics inside the UN and also taking

1388
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:56,380
into account the high-level panel going

1389
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:58,720
on Thanks thanks for the Christian and

1390
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:01,030
Nicolas it's it was directed to you but

1391
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,669
if the other ones other speakers want to

1392
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:06,760
want to add something you're welcome

1393
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:09,460
so a few months ago we had the chance to

1394
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,610
have such an International

1395
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:16,240
inter-regional Coordination workshop and

1396
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:17,800
that sets within you nadir and that was

1397
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,189
something that was actually quite quite

1398
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,590
interesting because they together with

1399
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:25,780
CSIS set up this meeting in Geneva to

1400
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:27,630
figure out what the similarities and

1401
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:32,140
differences arbitrations across

1402
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:33,640
institutions and they were fairly

1403
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,920
inclusive in their approach so it wasn't

1404
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,509
just the flags and banners that you saw

1405
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,310
but you know the form of incidents

1406
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:41,140
responders was there and many other

1407
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,000
organizations like the Global Forum of

1408
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,609
cyber expertise so really the the

1409
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,030
organizations that are very much engaged

1410
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:51,560
in sort of

1411
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:55,440
transnational international activities

1412
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:59,400
whether or not unity are fields willing

1413
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,050
capable and and ready to sort of convene

1414
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,310
this in a more substantial basis that's

1415
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:06,810
obviously up to you nadir of course

1416
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,460
depending on which form you choose

1417
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:10,700
there's different implications within

1418
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,370
their mandate within what they can do so

1419
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,629
if you place it within you an Oda of

1420
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,160
course there's a tendency for first

1421
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,960
dimension perspective so yes there's

1422
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,278
this is the drawback and there's a

1423
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,730
challenge to really figure out which

1424
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:25,470
form you use you you know some people

1425
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:27,089
might even argue that the global forum

1426
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,380
for cyber expertise might be a chance to

1427
01:08:27,089 --> 01:08:31,950
have more of an interventional

1428
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:34,290
information exchange so I don't have so

1429
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:37,108
the cold and the kief of which form

1430
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:39,689
should be the right one I think in the

1431
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:41,850
end that's also a decision to be made by

1432
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:44,729
the sector's to really figure out how

1433
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:47,580
this best serve sort of the actual goal

1434
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:48,870
that is then agreed upon on this inter

1435
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:55,170
regional collaboration and information

1436
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:58,200
exchange judgment that the like-minded

1437
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:00,779
countries usually try to avoid take up

1438
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,960
cyber issues in the UN context it has

1439
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:08,520
the history in Internet governance so

1440
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:13,260
there is an old row between the free and

1441
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:16,260
open Internet community and UN certainly

1442
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:19,290
one nations desire to put internet under

1443
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:23,339
the multilateral structure of ITU or

1444
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:29,040
some other UN system agency and because

1445
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:30,720
of this philosophical difference between

1446
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,220
the democratic countries who would like

1447
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,990
to maintain the free and open Internet

1448
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,910
and we are happy to have the

1449
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:40,049
multi-stakeholder governance model and

1450
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:42,778
we don't mind that icon is governed by

1451
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:44,399
the law of California whereas we know

1452
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:49,109
that there are a number of countries

1453
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,040
that would like to have the DNS system

1454
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,380
and

1455
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,420
all the Internet infrastructure

1456
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:58,590
somewhere on the territory and I think

1457
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:01,680
this is the reason why why still we the

1458
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:04,380
cyber diplomats also avoid as much as

1459
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:07,470
possible all these discussions in the UN

1460
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:10,190
Framework however it doesn't mean that

1461
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:14,670
the UN discussions are totally

1462
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:16,830
unnecessary but we have to make sure

1463
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:20,640
that if you have a discussion at the UN

1464
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:23,610
under certain committee then it stays

1465
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,960
there and it's concentrated on certain

1466
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:29,130
issues of course now we have very exotic

1467
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,360
situation where all the cyber issues

1468
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,680
will be discussed under the first

1469
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,339
committee which is a disarmament

1470
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,790
committee so and I I don't know how it

1471
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,070
goes

1472
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:42,870
honestly speaking if we start discussing

1473
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:45,090
all sorts of simple cybersecurity more

1474
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:47,490
economic side of cyber issues under the

1475
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:50,360
disarmament context it certainly does

1476
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:53,010
not add anything useful to this debate

1477
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,990
the question of course is where do we in

1478
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:57,180
the UN to take up these questions and

1479
01:10:54,990 --> 01:11:01,200
possibly the high-level panel which you

1480
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:05,730
alluded to should result in some sort of

1481
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:07,260
more clear coordination structure

1482
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,419
between all these different parts of the

1483
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:14,040
moving parts of the UN however so

1484
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:16,080
therefore I think the the approach that

1485
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,720
the high-level panel has is not on cyber

1486
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,840
as you know it's all digital so there is

1487
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:24,810
a possibly some set of recommendations

1488
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:28,170
that they set forward how the UN can

1489
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:30,180
turn its attention to the digital issues

1490
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:32,820
and majority of those questions are

1491
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:35,670
still dealing with the digital divide in

1492
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:39,299
the UN context so all these cyber issues

1493
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:41,370
we discuss here at saikhan have not

1494
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,400
reached majority of the countries in the

1495
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:48,330
world so as you know so therefore we we

1496
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,980
like to keep it that way something thank

1497
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,990
you honey thank you thanks to the both

1498
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,059
of you I think we had a questioned

1499
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:56,670
lessee you had a question and then we

1500
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,960
had someone named on the other side of

1501
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:59,960
there of the whole

1502
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,640
from Tiber nerves and I have kind of

1503
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,080
one-and-a-half questions to the

1504
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,710
ambassador

1505
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:12,260
the first being an theorists has written

1506
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:13,670
excellently on the issue and Jesus asked

1507
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:15,980
very correctly is international law

1508
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:17,690
international and she has answered no

1509
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:20,889
it's not international so we have

1510
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:23,330
fundamental differences in states

1511
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:25,970
pertaining to what is the role of

1512
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,769
international law for them how do we

1513
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:30,830
understand international law so in the

1514
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:33,560
context of you and Gigi are there any

1515
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:35,780
possibilities or if there are how how

1516
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,970
can we minimize this divergence in these

1517
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,980
different fundamental views of the role

1518
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:41,540
of international law in general and that

1519
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,900
leads to my second question because you

1520
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:47,390
outlined very neatly what are the kind

1521
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,889
of the conversation points when it

1522
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:51,440
pertains to international law in that

1523
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:54,500
framework and you also said that you're

1524
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,960
kind of a glass half-full person so my

1525
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,250
question pertains you what are the some

1526
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,780
of the aspects of international where

1527
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:02,660
you can see that we can make real

1528
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:05,660
progress so that it won't become this

1529
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:08,090
talk war between those conversation

1530
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,809
points so where can we realistically

1531
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,610
make progress thank you first what's the

1532
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:16,520
role of international law in the Chi Chi

1533
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:19,099
context well you possibly know very well

1534
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:22,010
that the u.s. resolution has eliminated

1535
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:24,920
this difficult issue so international

1536
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:28,550
law will not be discussed with the gg at

1537
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:30,770
all this is this is not the verdict

1538
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:37,400
because this was the reason why the last

1539
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:42,050
GG fell apart however instead countries

1540
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:44,540
are invited to add their views on how

1541
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:48,050
international law applies to the final

1542
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:50,870
Chi Chi report and this is because as

1543
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:52,510
you know the Western countries and the

1544
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:55,580
China and Russia are not agreeing

1545
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:57,230
racialist but it's mostly China which

1546
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,360
are not agreeing that international law

1547
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:03,019
current one applies at all in cyberspace

1548
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,700
at least in its entirety so it's like in

1549
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:08,540
order not to stuck again in this

1550
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:10,880
question that the question is of the

1551
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:12,170
tape this is happening normally in any

1552
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,650
negotiations

1553
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:17,810
and therefore I don't think that we will

1554
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:20,679
get stuck in international lawyers use

1555
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:23,210
of the GG process so we will rather

1556
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:25,700
possibly look at the implementation of

1557
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:26,750
the current norms which of course also

1558
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:30,260
entails a lot of international

1559
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:33,380
discussion indirectly but in diplomacy

1560
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:35,810
it doesn't quite often matter what you

1561
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:37,730
exactly say but how you say it and what

1562
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:40,070
kind of terminology you use so it's a

1563
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:47,809
bit of this kind of compromise game

1564
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:50,599
there and your second question can you

1565
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:55,700
kind of remind how how exactly do did

1566
01:14:50,600 --> 01:15:02,410
you frame it so yeah the contestation

1567
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:04,639
areas possibly we will not even have

1568
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:07,250
very clear understanding amongst

1569
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,460
like-minded right now how the certain

1570
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:13,130
issues apply and the more you dwell and

1571
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,760
the more you'll find the quite new

1572
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,540
questions

1573
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:22,100
so the contestations point sovereignty

1574
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:24,200
certainly is something where we are

1575
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,970
still everybody is struggling but kind

1576
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,670
what what is exactly sovereignty in

1577
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:31,430
times of in times of digital technology

1578
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:35,990
and in times of packets moving

1579
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:39,020
throughout 77 this territories in two

1580
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:42,320
seconds well this is this is out there

1581
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:43,970
we have to discuss it I think none of

1582
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:47,360
the like-minded is saying very clearly

1583
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:48,830
here what exactly it means and I don't

1584
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,110
think we have to get stuck there

1585
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:57,790
actually if you don't know the answer we

1586
01:15:51,110 --> 01:16:01,400
just passed and then we go on the easier

1587
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:03,620
call would be to concentrate on own

1588
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,599
obligations so that you have to keep on

1589
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:09,890
order on your territory and it also is

1590
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,990
in 2013 report that you are responsible

1591
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:13,730
for your proxies you and you you are

1592
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:17,179
responsible for activities on your

1593
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:21,709
territory if you are not able to provide

1594
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:23,750
enough capabilities in order to stop the

1595
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,470
malicious activities on your territory

1596
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,170
Atlee

1597
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:31,130
then you should cooperate and and and

1598
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:33,800
and the others can help to mitigate the

1599
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:37,430
situation this kind of notions already

1600
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:42,050
in 2013 and 2015 reports so therefore I

1601
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:43,910
think trying to find the common areas of

1602
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:46,280
concentrations I think should be the way

1603
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:48,349
forward and not get stuck in these legal

1604
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,059
discussions with five lawyers in the

1605
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:52,340
room and five different opinions I think

1606
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,950
none of the policymakers actually wants

1607
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:57,020
that so we we are very pragmatic we want

1608
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:58,970
to go ahead and if there is too

1609
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,800
difficult discussion we just push them

1610
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:09,640
aside and go ahead with other things so

1611
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:12,620
this is what happens in real life I

1612
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:15,160
think I saw both nodding intent is there

1613
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:18,260
anything you would like to add to this I

1614
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:20,840
largely agree with what what you just

1615
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:24,470
outlined daily I think the real emphasis

1616
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:27,110
now is placed to implementing the

1617
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,210
agreed-upon languages there's a lot of

1618
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:31,250
work to be done there's key components

1619
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:34,310
that really need to put into practice

1620
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:36,950
and there's an extensive network of

1621
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:40,910
institutions and 18 agencies who can

1622
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:43,610
help contribute with that so I can see a

1623
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:46,490
lot of potential and also using the GG

1624
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:48,170
format to be more precise and how to

1625
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:51,170
operationalize degree agreed-upon

1626
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:54,290
language so that we're not just moving

1627
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:56,330
forward in terms of with but also in

1628
01:17:54,290 --> 01:18:01,100
depth in the context that we already

1629
01:17:56,330 --> 01:18:02,750
created Thanks I agree this is the right

1630
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,720
approach you know we need to create the

1631
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:09,230
consensus the the the same definition of

1632
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:13,210
the the topic so it's the only way I

1633
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:18,190
must say thanks so more questions

1634
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:18,190
whoever was sitting over there yes I

1635
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:23,809
think we have two of you so who can pass

1636
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:26,630
on the mic afterwards no no no go ahead

1637
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:29,300
you with a Christian I go hello I'm some

1638
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,840
well the Thomas I'm at the CCDC hearing

1639
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,200
talent

1640
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,690
so basically thank you for your speeches

1641
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,239
and

1642
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:39,910
one things that I noticed that I don't

1643
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:42,820
certainly see immobility in cyber so

1644
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:45,210
basically you did a good job to show us

1645
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:47,440
how many different working groups

1646
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:50,560
regional organization are working at

1647
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:53,440
sometimes at the same goals and

1648
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,290
objectives here I'm referring a little

1649
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,150
bit to the different approach approaches

1650
01:18:56,290 --> 01:19:01,090
that the UN is taking for cyber knows

1651
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:02,940
for example the UN Gigi at UA the UN

1652
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:05,950
open-ended working group for example

1653
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:08,349
that probably are discussing some there

1654
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:10,809
that would be probably some overlapping

1655
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:13,210
issues or overlapping problems to be

1656
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:15,340
discussed at the UN level so my point is

1657
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:19,239
a little bit thought-provoking otherwise

1658
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:22,570
there's no fun do you think that this

1659
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:25,330
merging this extreme proliferation of

1660
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:28,330
different organization regional

1661
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:34,690
international you name it also the Paris

1662
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:39,580
calls on national are kind of countering

1663
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:41,889
the emerging creation of cyber nodes

1664
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:43,600
I'm not talking about international

1665
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:47,110
level just like cyber gnomes just a

1666
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,600
political level it's not exactly what I

1667
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:54,009
would like to say during my speech we

1668
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,860
have to push on the right places but we

1669
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:58,690
have to control the flourishing of

1670
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:00,730
initiatives especially when our small

1671
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:04,089
initiative single state initiatives even

1672
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:05,879
if I I see that Paris called Paris Cole

1673
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:08,080
is a very interesting initiative

1674
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,510
especially because involve the private

1675
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:13,680
sector for the first time so I

1676
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:17,440
absolutely agree it's fundamental to

1677
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:19,450
create at regional level a common

1678
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,629
consensus but we have to control the

1679
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:26,860
flourishing of these initiatives my view

1680
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:31,540
all we have to increase personnel

1681
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:34,230
significantly in cyber oh yeah all sorts

1682
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:36,640
of initiatives and so we can cover yeah

1683
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:39,780
there should be a special cyber budget

1684
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,069
2% it was a joke

1685
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:44,169
nikka would you like to add something or

1686
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:45,579
shall we ask somewhere that you pass the

1687
01:20:44,169 --> 01:20:48,879
microphone over your shoulder

1688
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:50,619
I mean States decided to pass on these

1689
01:20:48,879 --> 01:20:53,649
two resolutions and so now there was a

1690
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:56,249
majority and apparently a large quantity

1691
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:59,709
of state sees merit and having those two

1692
01:20:56,249 --> 01:21:01,209
UN working working groups and yeah other

1693
01:20:59,709 --> 01:21:03,429
existing four also have sort of their

1694
01:21:01,209 --> 01:21:05,108
purposes and it remains to be seen how

1695
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:09,159
they will be used it's obviously up to

1696
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:10,959
the states but it's kind of everyone's

1697
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:20,228
guessing at this point how are they will

1698
01:21:10,959 --> 01:21:21,760
before Brian Kenner West Point there was

1699
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:24,329
a lot of talk about operating at the

1700
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:27,089
norms in cyberspace but it seems that

1701
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:29,049
different countermeasures and

1702
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:30,969
repercussions so to speak aren't

1703
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,189
necessarily stopping cyber attacks from

1704
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:35,229
happening do you think countries

1705
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:37,089
operating the norms at some point will

1706
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:39,010
have to break away from that in order to

1707
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:45,599
implement harsher countermeasures to

1708
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:47,739
actually stop these cyber attacks well

1709
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:49,809
certainly there should be some

1710
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:53,259
consequences at some point yes because

1711
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:55,809
otherwise it's not so obvious that there

1712
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,669
is incentives there are enough

1713
01:21:55,809 --> 01:22:00,399
incentives for the for the countries to

1714
01:21:57,669 --> 01:22:02,648
stop the activities and I think some

1715
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:05,010
analysis should be also done what kind

1716
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:09,039
of response would work on different

1717
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:11,709
countries maybe for some the public

1718
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:13,059
attribution is already working but the

1719
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:15,429
other for the others the public

1720
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:17,619
attribution or sanctions are not working

1721
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:19,929
and you have to go a bit further so I

1722
01:22:17,619 --> 01:22:21,518
think this kind of assessment is

1723
01:22:19,929 --> 01:22:24,189
currently taking place and once the

1724
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:27,539
like-minded how to tailor the response

1725
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:30,159
so that it would be efficient

1726
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:32,889
consequences are fundamental looking at

1727
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:35,499
for example the European Union the

1728
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:39,249
European Union Council decision of 10

1729
01:22:35,499 --> 01:22:42,339
days ago to create a norm to frozen all

1730
01:22:39,249 --> 01:22:46,659
the economics of the state entities

1731
01:22:42,339 --> 01:22:49,649
bodies that have created a cyberattack

1732
01:22:46,659 --> 01:22:51,879
that with a high level of damage so

1733
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:53,000
absolutely normally if you don't have

1734
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:55,250
consequences

1735
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,190
you don't why have you stopped to make

1736
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:02,590
crimes to make espionage terrorist

1737
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:02,589
attack and so on so it's fundamental

1738
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:07,820
thank you for the for the answers I

1739
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,990
think our time is running out but I

1740
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,480
don't want to let you off the stage

1741
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:14,480
before I teach you with a with a bit of

1742
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:18,950
future gazing so considering where we

1743
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:24,700
have come from from the from the first

1744
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:28,160
ever nation scale cyber attacks in in

1745
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:32,540
2007 to and compared to where we are now

1746
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:35,540
if you look down the road about 10 years

1747
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:40,640
where will where will you expect that we

1748
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:43,010
will be in terms of peace and security

1749
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,130
and stability in cyberspace so will

1750
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:49,970
states learn to restrain themselves or

1751
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:57,490
are we facing are we looming towards the

1752
01:23:49,970 --> 01:24:01,570
cages well I think we have not seen a

1753
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:05,510
armed attack type of cyber attack

1754
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:09,950
really so therefore possibly the state

1755
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:12,710
actors are exercising restraint what

1756
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:15,340
might be the issue for the future is the

1757
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:21,410
very fast proliferation of capabilities

1758
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:23,780
and the cyber black market is very

1759
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:27,110
lucrative business as I understand and

1760
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:30,969
many countries America many governments

1761
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:34,099
and also many non-state organizations

1762
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:36,460
might just acquire the capabilities and

1763
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:41,230
unleashed and without understanding

1764
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:44,120
effects and this might yes be the next

1765
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:46,580
event which will be the paradigm

1766
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,640
shifting event another one so much like

1767
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:50,809
happened with what a crying Abed yeah

1768
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:54,110
yeah whoo no crime not paid you were

1769
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:57,410
deliberately unleashed not so much until

1770
01:24:54,110 --> 01:25:01,040
over was that was not possibly

1771
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:03,680
measurable yes beforehand but I'm I'm

1772
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,610
talking about very serious capabilities

1773
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:09,480
which are not just

1774
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:11,099
ransomware type of capabilities and and

1775
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:15,690
we hope that this will not materialize

1776
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:17,370
and but the proliferation of players in

1777
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,839
the field is a serious issue and they

1778
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:21,059
have to start thinking how to make sure

1779
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,280
that we can somehow contain the

1780
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:28,890
proliferation proliferation of malicious

1781
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:31,969
tools Thank You Nico well if I knew

1782
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:34,740
where we are in ten years time I think

1783
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,090
or just a very helpful person that can

1784
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:38,790
figure out how to prevent potential

1785
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:41,000
negative impacts I don't know I think

1786
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:43,230
the one the one component that I'm

1787
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,730
passionate about as I see a lot of

1788
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:49,259
potential for enhanced awareness and

1789
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:52,950
capacity-building across the regions I

1790
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:55,220
think including the global South making

1791
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:58,559
sure that this an inclusive discussion

1792
01:25:55,220 --> 01:26:01,670
helping policymakers to figure out how

1793
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,800
to properly address this in

1794
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:06,960
understanding sort of the the potential

1795
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,170
technical implications of policy work

1796
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,550
these are considerations that I think

1797
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:15,240
receive more and more attention within

1798
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:17,130
the respective four that I used I think

1799
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,630
it's great to have the Global Forum of

1800
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:21,870
cyber expertise that's trying to pull

1801
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:24,480
together different expertise and its

1802
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:26,280
mapping all these activities I see a lot

1803
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,700
of potential and expanding that

1804
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,679
improving that and making use of in so

1805
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,780
that we can actually take advantage of

1806
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,000
the frameworks the decisions and

1807
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:37,769
agreements that have been agreed so far

1808
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,520
and I think that's enough work to do for

1809
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:43,220
the next ten years

1810
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:46,290
thanks for that from state state

1811
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:49,110
relationship I'm quite positive in the

1812
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:51,570
next year we are solving the problem of

1813
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:53,940
tribution very very fast we need to

1814
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:56,610
create a common consensus as we already

1815
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:58,049
said all during this this meeting the

1816
01:26:56,610 --> 01:27:00,150
problem will be for with non-state

1817
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:04,860
actors in my phone to be proxies is a

1818
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:07,139
very relevant actor and will be in the

1819
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:10,799
next year the most relevant actors also

1820
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:14,340
in a state stage relationship so I'm

1821
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:17,630
Italian I'm a lawyer and we very love to

1822
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:21,710
quote ancient Roman
