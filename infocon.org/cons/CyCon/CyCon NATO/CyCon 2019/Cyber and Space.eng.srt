1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
thank you very much and good morning

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,250
from my side as well and kindly

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,780
introduced me then yes I am a sort of

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:18,420
space lower person since long time ago

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,240
and got into cyberspace also so this is

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,580
a really fantastic topic for me my

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,439
favorite topic one of the few things

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,598
worth getting up for on a rainy Friday

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,460
morning when you've all been to party

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,340
last night but I'm sure it will be well

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,320
worth it how we will do it I think is we

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,010
will have about 20 minutes for the

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,989
speakers and then one or two relatively

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,489
short questions immediately after the

15
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,190
talk if you want to address something

16
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,379
exactly that speaker said in order to

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,349
keep some time for a discussion at the

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,730
end so bigger question since I think

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,309
will be more interesting actually when

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,398
we've heard three a bit different

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,669
perspectives on this extremely topical

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,890
and an interesting issue as you will

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,780
hear it is something that I mean cyber

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,970
space and space have talked about a lot

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,820
because the to influence one another

26
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,619
when it comes to rulemaking and so

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,779
perhaps especially forward for lawyers

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,299
but but also for others generally how do

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,430
we deal with these issues but also more

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,799
and more we see how we need to think

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,470
about cyber space in space in cyberspace

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,640
so so those are the topics we will have

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,829
from from different angles business

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,700
world the military world but we will

35
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:40,908
start with with James so james pavatt is

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:44,549
an oxford PhD student and looking at

37
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,799
satellites space-based systems security

38
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,420
of them and i think if i haven't got it

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,340
right the name of your talk will be the

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,860
impact to cyber weapons in outer space

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,860
so please i give the floor first few

42
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,009
thanks

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,560
hi so yeah I'm honored to start off this

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,120
presentation with a paper entitled the

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,070
cyber ace at a set meeting

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,800
anti-satellite weapons that kind of

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,900
theorizes about the strategic effect of

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,070
cyber weapons in the domain of outer

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,990
space space is important to kind of NATO

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,880
audience this might seem obvious but

51
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,440
since the earliest days of the space

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,780
race there's kind of been a recognition

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,270
that space has this unique allure to

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,620
military strategic purposes Lyndon

55
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,060
Johnson when he was a senator in the

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,239
earliest days of the space race said

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,520
control of space means control of the

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,340
world and this kind of embodies the

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,320
tantalizing myth of space as a ultimate

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,600
high ground that whoever controls the

61
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,090
heavens controls the earth the sea and

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,459
the sky and whether or not this is

63
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,160
completely true it has become clear that

64
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,050
space is a vital component of how modern

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,290
militaries approach war fighting and

66
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,459
strategy this was particularly

67
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,290
demonstrated by the overwhelming victory

68
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,540
of US and Allied forces during the Gulf

69
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,060
War when space-based systems are widely

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,859
attributed providing unprecedented c4isr

71
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,110
capabilities so the ability to

72
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,120
communicate to individual war fighters

73
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,070
to have unparalleled intelligence from

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,350
imaging satellites and have precise

75
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,930
positional information given how

76
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,390
important space systems have become it's

77
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,709
kind of strange that this number here is

78
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,750
zero by my count

79
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,799
people aren't attacking satellites in

80
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,360
the status quo we're not seeing

81
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,459
satellites blow up in every battlefield

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,470
operation and this doesn't make

83
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,150
intuitive sense satellites are extremely

84
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,130
visible you just need a telescope to

85
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,630
know where they are they're fragile

86
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,269
because launch costs are difficult and

87
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,709
expensive they move very fast which

88
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,480
means a small piece of debris can do

89
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,010
serious damage and they're not

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,298
operationally responsive once a

91
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,810
satellite is destroyed it may take

92
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,610
months or years to replace it so in this

93
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,650
presentation I'll kind of start out by

94
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,180
asking the theoretical question about

95
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,769
why this isn't happening why there

96
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,540
aren't space wars in the status quo and

97
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,120
I'll draw out three kind of arguments

98
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,828
from the literature that argue why we

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,079
aren't using kinetic assets and then

100
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,700
I'll build on that with the cyber

101
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,070
context thinking about how a cyber

102
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,769
anti-satellite weapon might interface

103
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,239
with these same domain features and I'll

104
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,740
contend that there are differences in

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,000
cyber weapons that are

106
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,770
really concerning from a space

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,320
perspective and might have concerning

108
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,470
impacts on space strategy however this

109
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,310
presentation is explicitly

110
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,080
interdisciplinary I come from a mixed

111
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,400
background with some IRS stuff as well

112
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,289
as I'm doing more technical computer

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,090
science work now and so I wanted to put

114
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,180
this to the test as well and build a

115
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,979
simulated cyber ASAT capability so we

116
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,140
also kind of look at what this would be

117
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,060
in practice we walk through simulations

118
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,349
where we design a cyber a set weapon to

119
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,300
get a feel for what one might look like

120
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,880
and I feel for how difficult it would be

121
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,350
to develop these capabilities

122
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,480
so the first theoretical constraint

123
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,450
against space Wars is a very intuitive

124
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,620
one and that relates to accessibility

125
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,580
this is a picture actually from

126
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,740
something that happened after I

127
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,140
published the paper this is the recent

128
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,670
Indian anti-satellite weapon test and

129
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,530
it's kind of your traditional kinetic

130
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,780
ASAT you have a rocket that's full of

131
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,190
fire the fire pushes something hard into

132
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,200
orbit which crashes into a satellite

133
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,830
breaks it into a million pieces mission

134
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,690
accomplished

135
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,880
as simple as that sounds from that kind

136
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,550
of glib explanation this is literally

137
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,290
rocket science and as a result there

138
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,980
aren't many countries that have this

139
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,000
capacity depending on how you count

140
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,190
specifically within the EU they're about

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,630
10 or so countries that have domestic

142
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,400
orbital launch capabilities the ability

143
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,920
to put anything in orbit themselves

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,109
whether that is a space system for

145
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,670
research or for imaging and then within

146
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,860
those the subset of countries that have

147
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,720
offensive capabilities is less than half

148
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,520
we're talking about four countries that

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,990
have demonstrated the precision and

150
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,909
finesse to use an offensive

151
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,360
anti-satellite weapon kinetically that's

152
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,840
China

153
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,310
the US Russia and most recently India

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,409
even when you get this far even when you

155
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,610
have a national space program even when

156
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,890
you know how to use it to attack a

157
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,720
satellite you still might not like doing

158
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,789
so for the simple reason that it's very

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,010
expensive to have a meaningful intercept

160
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,110
capability the cost of taking out say

161
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,730
three or four key satellites is multiple

162
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,590
rocket launchers potentially spaced over

163
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,000
multiple days and we're talking about an

164
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,530
operation that scales towards the

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,720
billions of dollars end of the spectrum

166
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,270
which means acceptance scenarios of

167
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,700
extreme need genetic ASAT is not

168
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,289
necessarily very appealing if we

169
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,270
contrast this with the kind of cyber

170
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,530
context you see that the baseline

171
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,599
threshold is met by all countries

172
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,640
already everyone has access to computing

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,060
technology everyone has access to the

174
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,700
Internet

175
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,480
even non-state actors can kind of play

176
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,539
in sybers

177
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,400
face moreover a recent kind of offhand

178
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,600
media remark by an NSA official

179
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,219
estimated there about a hundred

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,840
countries with offensive cyber

181
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,640
capabilities that are of concern to the

182
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,320
United States now there's a whole range

183
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,390
of capacities within that list of

184
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,180
countries but I think it's fair to say

185
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,099
that in general a country is much closer

186
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,440
to an offensive cyber program than they

187
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,910
are to a national space program and once

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,650
you have that cyber program once you

189
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,720
have the expertise to build cyber

190
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,520
weapons generally the cost of a specific

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,650
operation might be on the scale of

192
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,599
hundreds tens of thousands of dollars

193
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,669
maybe acquire some zero-days or hire

194
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,470
some domain experts but it's definitely

195
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,350
not the same thing as rock as launching

196
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,270
a rocket the next kind of general

197
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,040
constraint that is talked about in a

198
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,409
literature against Connecticut SATs is a

199
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,420
normative one this map behind me is a

200
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,490
map of signatories to the Outer Space

201
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,930
Treaty countries in green have signed

202
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,270
and ratified in international law

203
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,680
countries in yellow have signed it and

204
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,419
the Outer Space Treaty if there's one

205
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,730
bit of consensus in the space policy

206
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,110
literature is not perfect there are a

207
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,090
lot of problems with the treaty but it

208
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,070
attempts to ban weaponization and

209
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,869
militarization of outer space and it's

210
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,630
been around for a long time and has been

211
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,070
widely adopted a hundred plus parties

212
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,260
have signed it including all major

213
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,700
spacefaring nations and so as a result

214
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,560
it has an influence on the way States

215
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,930
approach the use of kinetic

216
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,370
anti-satellite weapons specifically when

217
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,260
the states break the rules when they

218
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,060
push the boundaries they do it couched

219
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,260
in legal rhetoric citing the Outer Space

220
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,940
Treaty and talking about why it's

221
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,560
justified say to remove hazardous

222
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,600
materials from orbit that could threaten

223
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,400
civilians or because whatever they did

224
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,410
is technically not a weapon which kind

225
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,390
of demonstrates that states feel a need

226
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,000
to explain their misbehavior with

227
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,610
kinetic a sets in a way that they might

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,860
not with cyber a sense

229
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,970
moreover states feel this need in part

230
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,100
because they know they'll get caught

231
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,540
attributing a rocket launch is not very

232
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,950
difficult there only so many places you

233
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,990
can launch a rocket from there's a lot

234
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,190
of fire there's a physical effect you

235
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,080
can have photographs like the one I just

236
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,550
showed you so states feel a need to

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,539
justify what they're doing and to be

238
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,150
sure they're willing to pay those

239
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,190
diplomatic costs in the cyber context

240
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,659
things are again pretty different we

241
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,719
have the Tollan manual and we have some

242
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,310
kind of international agreements on best

243
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,870
actions and best practices in cyberspace

244
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,370
but we don't have anything like the

245
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,289
Outer Space Treaty that's been codified

246
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,390
into hundreds of kind

247
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,740
domestic law and there's a long way to

248
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,090
go in norms generation and perhaps

249
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,950
lessons to be learned from the Outer

250
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,380
Space Treaty but those lessons haven't

251
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,580
been put into effect yet

252
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,470
moreover states have demonstrated that

253
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,540
they are fine pushing the boundaries in

254
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,760
cyberspace whether this is us

255
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,439
surveillance on allies or Chinese

256
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,610
state-sponsored hacking of companies or

257
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,680
Russian interference in the u.s.

258
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,210
elections it's very clear that the rules

259
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,459
to the extent they exist in cyberspace

260
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,930
are still very malleable and states are

261
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,090
willing to take risks and kind of push

262
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,410
the limits of what's acceptable and part

263
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,220
of this is because they think they might

264
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,650
get away with it

265
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,990
attribution is not as easy in cyberspace

266
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,610
even if it is possible as it would be in

267
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,080
an outerspace context there's a lot of

268
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,730
plausible deniability there's a lot of

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
room for refutation that you simply

270
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,680
don't have when someone has a video of a

271
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,670
rocket leaving your country spaceport

272
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,020
finally the last constraint I'm going to

273
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,089
talk about relates to the space

274
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,220
environment itself so this animation

275
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,920
behind me is debris that was generated

276
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,960
by the 2007 Chinese asset test and two

277
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,849
other debris generating incidents each

278
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,370
of these dots is an existential threat

279
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,260
to a satellite these are pieces of metal

280
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,540
or different like orbital components

281
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,830
that are flying at thousands of miles an

282
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,660
hour and if they cry with a satellite

283
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,900
they could cause it to disintegrate or

284
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,430
to deorbit and stop functioning as a

285
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,720
result when you launch a kinetic

286
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,699
anti-satellite weapon you break a

287
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,860
satellite up you add more pieces to the

288
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,990
sphere and that poses a high risk of

289
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,730
collateral damage to your own space

290
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,500
assets from this generated debris field

291
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,120
which is also highly difficult to

292
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,430
predict especially over the long term

293
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,990
and the long term matters because this

294
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,660
debris will remain in orbit for

295
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,730
potentially decades before it enters

296
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,050
into the atmosphere and burns up so even

297
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,000
if there's a short-term benefit to

298
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,930
kinetic ASAT attack that also has to

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,050
outweigh the long-term costs to doing so

300
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,489
and everyone who could cause harm with

301
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,469
the kinetic case that cares about this

302
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,450
kind of thing these are all spacefaring

303
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,190
nations who have an interest in being

304
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,480
able to use orbit themselves so they can

305
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,670
get the benefit of that massive

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,980
investment in a national space program

307
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,589
and so their shared stakeholders in this

308
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,390
ecology if we look at the cyber context

309
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,520
things are again pretty different you

310
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,980
can imagine a zero debris counter space

311
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,439
capability with cyberattack for example

312
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,220
disabling one key sensor on a satellite

313
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,170
system

314
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,029
or use dropping on communications

315
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,819
without necessarily directly damaging

316
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,649
the satellite moreover a cyberattack can

317
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,628
be constrained and time bound in a way

318
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,610
that debris cannot you could turn off a

319
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,220
satellite for three key hours during a

320
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,389
battlefield operation without

321
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,759
permanently damaging it and having an

322
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,709
impact on the environment and finally

323
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,120
many of the attackers simply don't care

324
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,369
about the space environment if you're a

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,470
small country that doesn't have a space

326
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,029
program you might view denying access to

327
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,069
space to the United States for the next

328
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,629
twenty thirty years as an upside to a

329
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,910
cyberattack because now they no longer

330
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,329
can exercise those asymmetric advantages

331
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,769
that space offers the powerful so we've

332
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,930
kind of made a theoretical case here

333
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,699
that accessibility deter ability in the

334
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,979
space environment have constrained the

335
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:31,779
use of kinetic ASAT weapons but that

336
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,490
these same domain features are not as

337
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,560
powerful with respect to cyber attacks

338
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,959
on satellites this is all to say that

339
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,018
security and space won't come naturally

340
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,399
anymore if it's ever come naturally

341
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,110
being able to defend satellites against

342
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,810
cyber attacks will require a conscious

343
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,360
effort from industry academia and the

344
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,369
public sector to consider these threats

345
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,949
as a real and emerging change in the way

346
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,959
to Maine operates rather than leave it

347
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:58,599
there this talk has been given many

348
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,040
times essentially every new invention in

349
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,689
space technology whether it's an

350
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,339
improved launch capacity or better

351
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,930
precision has been prophesied as

352
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,180
bringing about the next era of space

353
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,680
Wars and rather than immediately add my

354
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,540
name to that ash heap of incorrect

355
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,219
predictions I'd like to kind of test

356
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,589
this a little bit and get a better feel

357
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,569
for what a cyber ASAT might look like so

358
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,639
we've designed a case study where we try

359
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,050
to simulate a cyber ASAT we make some

360
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,540
pretty generous assumptions to keep the

361
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,339
case studies simple but the hope is to

362
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,899
kind of get a feel for what this might

363
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,250
look like so we can get an idea of what

364
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,860
defending against a cyber race that

365
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,959
might look like so our target in this

366
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,430
simulation is a component of spaceflight

367
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,008
operations called space situational

368
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,508
awareness data it was used to generate

369
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,850
that image I showed you earlier of all

370
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:41,860
the debris objects essentially countries

371
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,779
like the United States Russia and China

372
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,699
operate distributed sensor networks

373
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,559
around the world where they use radar

374
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,180
and lasers to track debris objects in

375
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,189
orbit and try to guess where those

376
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,560
debris objects are going to go over the

377
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,560
next

378
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,569
live days these estimates are then fed

379
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,400
into a centralized repository of kind of

380
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,170
orbital projections and characteristics

381
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,270
which are shared with third parties

382
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,729
these might be third party space flight

383
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,590
service operators like AGI or these

384
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,230
might be directly with satellite

385
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,089
operators themselves through alerts or

386
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,730
the open source API is like space

387
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,650
tracked out of work and these

388
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,510
projections are flat are fed into a

389
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,819
space flight operators flight control

390
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,200
systems and they look for which debris

391
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,670
objects might be coming near their

392
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,710
satellites over the next couple of days

393
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,420
and they plan manoeuvres if there's a

394
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,640
debris object that poses a threat to

395
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,380
avoid those objects this isn't ideal

396
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,420
every time you have to move a satellite

397
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,279
you use fuel you increase risk of a

398
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,410
mission failure and you increase the

399
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:38,089
cost of the mission but it's definitely

400
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,959
preferable to having your satellite get

401
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,490
hit by a debris object and disintegrate

402
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,100
our target for this attack isn't some

403
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,480
esoteric space system it's the stuff and

404
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,610
right here this is the bread and butter

405
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,890
of cybersecurity attacks its databases

406
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,470
information at rest its network

407
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,000
connections information in transit our

408
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,700
threat model is pretty straightforward

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,680
and pretty generous the attacker first

410
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,480
we say that the attacker has gained some

411
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,370
ability to influence stuff within those

412
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,440
red dots they either have found a

413
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,880
zero-day in a database like an Oracle

414
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,320
database or something like that or

415
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,570
they're a man-in-the-middle or maybe

416
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,530
they are the organizer maybe they were

417
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,180
the people who are actually operating

418
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,010
the database so you could imagine say

419
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,839
that you were iran and you depended in

420
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,339
the United States for space situational

421
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,290
awareness data you might not always

422
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,839
trust that data if the US starts lying

423
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,849
to you additionally we make a very

424
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,320
generous assumption which is that space

425
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,420
situational awareness data is not

426
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,980
subject to additional verification so in

427
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,510
the real world if there's a debris

428
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,390
collision projected you can call up the

429
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,770
JS Bach and be like you said this debris

430
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,300
objects gonna come close to my satellite

431
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,860
can you verify that with additional

432
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,109
sensing or can you check this reading

433
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,000
before we undergo a maneuver we assume

434
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,440
that this either doesn't happen or that

435
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,940
the attacker has found a way to

436
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,430
manipulate the results of that second

437
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,410
verification stage as well and then

438
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,829
finally we do make the attacker do some

439
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,390
work

440
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,190
they can't just invent debris objects

441
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,959
that don't exist they can't cause things

442
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,459
to teleport they need to try to be

443
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,079
stealthy with the actual changes they

444
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,280
make to this data set with a goal of not

445
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,990
getting immediate

446
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,180
in the FEMA silent battle we're gonna

447
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,830
try to have a silent attack so our goal

448
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,760
is to take something that's not going to

449
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,100
collide with a satellite in the future

450
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,260
so a near-miss event and make it look

451
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,300
like it'll be a collision this has the

452
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,160
benefit of potentially causing a

453
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,319
satellite operator to move their

454
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,670
satellite when they don't need to which

455
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,260
increases the cost of their space

456
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,180
missions shortens the life span of the

457
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,560
satellites and it's kind of a slow burn

458
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,900
effect right this isn't a catastrophic

459
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,160
impact that generates debris but it's a

460
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,050
sort of thing a country might want to do

461
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,850
if they're hostile but not in conflicts

462
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,469
it's one of their adversaries you can

463
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,240
imagine a much worse version of this

464
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,740
scenario using the same kind of

465
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,360
mechanism which would be where an

466
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,360
attacker takes a projected collision

467
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,550
event and conceals it this could cause a

468
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,960
short-term catastrophic failure but it

469
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,520
has the risk of generating a debris

470
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,790
field which may be acceptable some

471
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,350
adversaries unacceptable to others the

472
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,640
data we target in our simulation is

473
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,680
stored in the format of a two line

474
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,650
element set this is a widely used format

475
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,870
for describing space objects orbital

476
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,699
characteristics it was developed to

477
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,080
actually use with punch cards on

478
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,480
mainframe computers which is why the

479
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,490
format has so little information but

480
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,930
it's surprisingly accurate depending on

481
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,690
how you propagate it you can get about a

482
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,229
kilometer of precision over a 72 hour 72

483
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,940
hour period using widely available

484
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,800
propagators our attacker will only be

485
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,720
allowed to change these fields in the

486
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,339
two line element set the idea being that

487
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,290
if we limit what the attacker can change

488
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,390
we limit their effects the risk of

489
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,819
detection and further in our paper we at

490
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,439
Lee actually outlined also magnitude

491
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,510
constraints on how much the attacker is

492
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,450
allowed to constrain me to change these

493
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,189
fields the first job the attacker has is

494
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,960
figuring out which of the elements in

495
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,970
this database of thousands and thousands

496
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,190
of orbital objects are the best to

497
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,320
change so we call this our acquisition

498
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,450
phase this animation behind me kind of

499
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,980
shows how we do this so we have the

500
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,320
sphere around our satellite which is a

501
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,120
thousand kilometers in diameter and we

502
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,190
propagate the satellite that's going to

503
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,260
be our victim for a 72 hour period as

504
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,210
one of those white dots enters a sphere

505
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,770
at the height of the satellite we then

506
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,319
try to find its time of closest approach

507
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,599
and the distance where it where it is at

508
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,040
closest approach the five objects that

509
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,810
pass closest to the satellite or are

510
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,619
candidates for manipulation that the

511
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,809
attacker will try to target

512
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,389
in the next stage which we call the

513
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,490
perturbation stage the attacker uses a

514
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,319
genetic algorithm so he treats the two

515
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,779
line element sets as a genome sequence

516
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,428
in essence and tries to modify the

517
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,470
characteristics of that two line element

518
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,750
set with two metrics of fitness the

519
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,039
first is the closest pass so they want

520
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,570
to minimize the distance that that

521
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,000
object comes from the satellite over the

522
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,220
next 72 hours the second thing that they

523
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,590
try to modify over this genetic process

524
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,179
is to minimize the amount of change they

525
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,309
make so these are two metrics of fitness

526
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,710
and together we eventually find a

527
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,570
scenario where the debris object falls

528
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,100
within that zone of uncertainty

529
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,689
surrounding the estimate for our

530
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,760
simulations that was a one kilometer

531
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,559
pass but we actually found that it could

532
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,000
probably be reduced down to 200 meters

533
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,279
with a little bit more computing power

534
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,380
and a larger debris field once you have

535
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,169
a near-miss scenario or what you have

536
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,029
now collision scenario you propagate

537
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,559
that back into the database so you put

538
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,559
it back in the two line element format

539
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,928
in our generation phase and you change

540
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,760
the entry in the database very slightly

541
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,710
to change the projection pretty

542
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,720
dramatically from a non collision event

543
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,279
to a collision event you'll notice here

544
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,740
that these fields have been slightly

545
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,539
modified the underlined in red are all

546
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,520
of the changes and these are within

547
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,690
constraints that are configurable the

548
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,399
attacker could then put this into the

549
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,850
database and potentially impact space

550
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:33,760
flight operations so in our simulation

551
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,439
we targeted a the iridium satellite

552
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,260
constellation and those orbital

553
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,399
projections I showed you which has 111

554
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,450
critical communication satellites that

555
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,629
are widely used by military and

556
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,950
commercial operators and our debris

557
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,779
field was very small and only had about

558
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,669
500 debris objects there are actually

559
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,679
thousands of candidates in space the

560
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,659
reason we kept the debris field so small

561
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,980
is we wanted to do this on consumer

562
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,929
grade Hardware so this was done on kind

563
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,700
of your standard commercial laptops not

564
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:59,620
any sort of sophisticated supercomputer

565
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,020
technology and we found they were able

566
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,959
to find a malicious collision event over

567
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,629
an arbitrary 72-hour window within 93

568
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,179
percent success rate within 15 minutes

569
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,700
of running the attack so this is all to

570
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,799
say that this the core of this attack is

571
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,960
not beyond the means of any particular

572
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,240
adversary once they've gained access to

573
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,190
those databases which may or may not be

574
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,470
difficult depending on the operational

575
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,410
nature of those databases moving that to

576
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,870
an ace that capable

577
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,930
is potentially not as difficult as one

578
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,179
might believe now I don't present this

579
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,830
as a great way to attack satellites my

580
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,300
hope is that nobody in the room is about

581
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,480
to scurry off to their offices in a

582
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,980
panic the ideally the space flight

583
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,040
operators understand that there is a

584
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,780
trust relationship in using SSA data

585
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,190
ideally the J Spock and no Wright

586
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,770
understand that their databases are

587
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,510
potential targets for attack rather what

588
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm trying to do is present the case

589
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,900
that a simple traditional cyber

590
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,820
vulnerability on the ground something

591
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,140
that's not a specialized space system

592
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,689
something that's not particularly unique

593
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,280
or novel can have a novel impact in

594
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,330
outer space and can have those strategic

595
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,670
effects that we were talking about

596
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,889
earlier and that such attacks are within

597
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:11,410
the means of a broad range of potential

598
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,190
attackers so to kind of wrap up this

599
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,740
scenario in this thought experiment

600
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,050
we've argued that cyber a set weapon

601
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,360
could have a dramatic impact on the

602
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,940
strategic balance of outer space because

603
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,590
it's not constrained by the domain

604
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,290
features that have traditionally made

605
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,550
kinetic ace that's less appealing

606
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,780
moreover we've argued that emerging

607
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,850
threats might be able to take advantage

608
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,830
of this cyber space is a place where

609
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,810
more people can play more effectively

610
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,399
and having an impact in space is no

611
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,070
longer limited to just spacefaring

612
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,860
nations but to smaller nations and to

613
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,389
non-state actors as well that said we've

614
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,860
also found that the attack surface of

615
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,080
space systems is something that still

616
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,179
needs a lot of characterization a lot of

617
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,399
the knowledge in this domain is siloed

618
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,170
behind classification barriers it's not

619
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
publicly known or it's behind very

620
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,280
distinct in proprietary systems and at

621
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,470
least personally I'd argue that there's

622
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,000
a real need for a research push to get a

623
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,740
sense of what makes satellite

624
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,440
information systems technologically

625
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,060
unique what kind of things might require

626
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,890
specialized academic research or

627
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,240
specialized industry research that would

628
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,730
benefit from the wider cybersecurity

629
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,080
community over there's also a point to

630
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,330
be made here that there's some aspects

631
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,250
of this attack and generally space-based

632
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,870
systems that aren't unique there's a lot

633
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,060
that space has in common with other

634
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,439
domains whether that be other critical

635
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,870
infrastructure domains that rely on

636
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,880
specialized systems or whether that be

637
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,860
just general information systems and so

638
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,630
there's also value in finding the

639
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,340
aspects of space that aren't novel and

640
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,200
that aren't unique and seeing where

641
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,639
lessons from other domains might be

642
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,440
applied effectively

643
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,480
what kind of general approaches to

644
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,210
cybersecurity need to be applied in

645
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,770
space and how we can apply those so

646
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,720
hopefully this presentation has given

647
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,160
you all some food for thought and given

648
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,490
the panel something to disagree with or

649
00:21:49,160 --> 00:22:07,340
discuss I'm glad to be here and happy to

650
00:21:52,490 --> 00:22:09,350
answer any questions what came to my

651
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,149
mind is how it's paced is a lot of

652
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,469
things that I kind of talked about and

653
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,910
talked about and they don't really

654
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,260
happen but then at the certain point

655
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,480
they start happening it's the same with

656
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,540
private use so do we have one or two

657
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,890
short questions we will have the other

658
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,659
presentation some more time for

659
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,570
discussion later but if there's anybody

660
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,160
who wants to dress like rather some

661
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,929
clarification or something like that for

662
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,970
discussion we'll come back later but if

663
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:36,680
you want you okay in that case we'll

664
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,350
move on with the next speakers that will

665
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,540
be mr. Robert drowsing who is from

666
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,760
Airbus defence and space head of product

667
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,649
security for space so dealing with

668
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,650
protecting space against cyber threats

669
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,250
so now you can you can say what what

670
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:53,630
you're going to do about this you're

671
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,880
actually going to talk about cyber and

672
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,550
space full lifecycle protection so I

673
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,830
think that fits very well with its of

674
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:05,510
shooting down the plan of of James here

675
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,939
so it's a pleasure to be here for the

676
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,700
first time and speak on behalf of my

677
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,890
company I'm representing the other side

678
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,890
in that case basically the industry who

679
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,040
has to build maintain and operate

680
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,890
spacecraft

681
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,659
I'm from Airbus defence in space as you

682
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,150
some of you might know Airbus is not

683
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,240
only building aircraft and helicopters

684
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:31,190
no we also the number one company in

685
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,740
space in Europe we are also the number

686
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:37,040
one supplier in the world of what we

687
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,050
call Earth observation satellites and we

688
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,840
are home based across seven European

689
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:47,419
countries and we operate at 16 sites

690
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,189
across these European countries the 16

691
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,360
sites I will come back later is one

692
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,669
the current targets of our activities

693
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,149
and I will show you in a minute what it

694
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:03,779
means

695
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:06,830
so what are our areas of concern what

696
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:09,720
you see is there is a need for more

697
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,970
interconnectivity of spacecraft and

698
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,039
spacecraft to ground communications are

699
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,129
more complex over time we're talking now

700
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,590
about new communication links like an

701
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:21,899
European data relay Highway in the space

702
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,699
system that is transmitting data from

703
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:26,668
satellites to the earth at high speed

704
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,610
and it's based on laser communication

705
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:33,480
the question is this connectivity is it

706
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,559
secure can it be compromised so this is

707
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,460
our question that we are posing

708
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:43,230
currently ourselves also we have very

709
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:45,779
complex components in our spacecraft not

710
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,179
specifically designed to be secure some

711
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,759
commercial off-the-shelf systems we're

712
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:55,549
going more and more into this new space

713
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:58,620
area where speed and cost matters so

714
00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:00,809
away from bespoke systems to commercial

715
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:05,039
off-the-shelf systems building smaller

716
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:08,158
satellites for less cost what also is a

717
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,139
good thing for us our products last very

718
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,169
long we have satellites in orbit that

719
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:14,668
are 10 20 years in orbit already they

720
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:16,889
have been developed for a long time

721
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:20,039
before that so we are talking about very

722
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:22,408
long time spans where our systems are

723
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,139
exposed to threats when we design these

724
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:28,710
systems 15 20 years ago we had no idea

725
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:31,049
of fiber threats the scenarios were

726
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:35,429
evolving evolving over the last few

727
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:39,418
years and we have to cope with that and

728
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,610
protect our systems the question also

729
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,559
who is support who is responsible for

730
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,289
the security of such a product such as

731
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,750
satellite is it us this industry and as

732
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:51,240
a manufacturer is it the operator of a

733
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,549
satellite later on in the civilian space

734
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,850
or even the military environment who

735
00:25:53,549 --> 00:26:00,330
takes care of protecting the system

736
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,980
against cyber threats we have a big

737
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,270
topic currently which is especially

738
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,400
unique in the European

739
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:08,190
Union one of our big customers is the

740
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,559
European Space Agency the European Space

741
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,470
Agency has a unique concept they called

742
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,139
chill return that means we as one of the

743
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,360
three large prime contractors in Europe

744
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,059
we will get the contract the prime

745
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:24,149
contract for a spacecraft but we have to

746
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,610
involve a large number of SMEs small and

747
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:30,750
medium sized enterprises across Europe

748
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:32,639
that will build and assemble and design

749
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,070
components and we will have to integrate

750
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,700
these components so our supply chain is

751
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:41,790
very deep and very wide and the question

752
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,580
is how can we Security's supply chain to

753
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,700
make sure that a single supplier in some

754
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:50,970
new European member state country of

755
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,309
Asia is delivering some kind of small

756
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,470
software a software module that we

757
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:57,720
integrate later on and our satellite or

758
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,970
in our satellite mission control systems

759
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:06,929
how can we make sure this system is

760
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:09,059
secured so yes we have also some new

761
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:12,660
customers coming traditionally

762
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,280
institutional we know that from imminent

763
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,440
military environment we get clear

764
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,080
security requirements from our customer

765
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,640
our custom is also willing to pay for

766
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,699
this implementation of these

767
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,220
requirements into our system but now as

768
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,730
I said new customers coming in may be

769
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,100
security is not the top topic may be

770
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,900
time to market is a high higher value

771
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,899
for them and we have to make sure that

772
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,330
we also educate our customers in the

773
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,030
protection of their assets later on

774
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:47,909
during the lifecycle of their in that

775
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:51,300
case spacecraft so what threats are we

776
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:54,480
facing to our products you see on the

777
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:57,629
top left we have the modes of attack as

778
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,809
we have seen very very new modes of

779
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:04,020
attack are popping up all the time we

780
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:06,750
have of course traditional additional

781
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,960
threats to our spacecraft like jamming

782
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,690
like spoofing of signals for instance

783
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,660
GPS signals which is around for a long

784
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,830
time however we see now more and more

785
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,320
coming up

786
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,070
my friend the cyber threat not only in

787
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,129
the traditional IT world but also in the

788
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,100
ICS world in the control systems in the

789
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,510
tools we use to build our spacecraft so

790
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,668
there is the risk increasing

791
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,480
significantly I will tell about that in

792
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:38,220
a minute and also then we have what we

793
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,130
see now in different phases of the

794
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,850
spacecraft lifecycle threats that were

795
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,559
never envisioned that way like in orbit

796
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,250
vulnerabilities so we have fetched well

797
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,658
spacecraft when they operate in orbit

798
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,630
one might be a cyber threat but we have

799
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,480
also physical effects by let's say Co

800
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,980
orbital spacecraft operated by some

801
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,440
other nations that approach our

802
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,820
spacecraft they can do direct harm to

803
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,159
our spacecraft you have to protect

804
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,340
against this one also so who are the

805
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,590
threat actors we as airbus are one of

806
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,059
the prime targets unfortunately for all

807
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,970
kind of that actress

808
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,220
starting from script kiddies hackers who

809
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:20,549
attacked our systems every day all the

810
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:24,600
way up political activists terroristic

811
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:28,168
attacks organized crime up to state

812
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,178
actors what is the impact the impact if

813
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:34,169
such an attack is successful on one our

814
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:36,659
systems we have eventually laid a route

815
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,720
to attack to our customers if a

816
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,210
spacecraft is attacked it can affect

817
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,360
maybe the systems of the customers we

818
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:48,480
can lose the product in worst case if

819
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,889
you have a successful attempt attacking

820
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,289
our spacecraft you might lose it

821
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:55,320
we could also loss the product integrity

822
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:57,269
so that could be falsified information

823
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,010
coming from from the product from the

824
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,200
spacecraft we could lost our

825
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:04,320
intellectual property which would be not

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,000
so good for us there is threats that are

827
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,250
might be dormant through the whole

828
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,080
supply chain as mentioned before that we

829
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,570
don't know we have not detected and it

830
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,110
might explode into a face at any given

831
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:18,629
time and also we might lose custom

832
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,928
information customer data or even verse

833
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:24,809
8 our data controlled either personnel

834
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:27,210
data that would be also a significant

835
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,190
consequence for us as a company you see

836
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,190
here some consequences loss of

837
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,220
customer confidence a direct financially

838
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:38,490
impact if you lose the spacecraft but

839
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,950
also worst case safety of the product or

840
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:45,870
even safety of life I show you some of

841
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,490
the products we need to protect so to

842
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,709
cope with all this our company has

843
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,870
established about four years ago an

844
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,140
internal organization that is called

845
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,060
product security office I'm in charge of

846
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,270
the product security office for Space

847
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:04,500
Systems activities and our mission is to

848
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:06,629
protect all our product against cyber

849
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,730
threats throughout the whole life cycle

850
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:15,600
of the product he starts with very early

851
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:19,070
R&D faces up to definition development

852
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,899
implementation industrialization

853
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:25,050
operations testing maintenance and

854
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,930
support during the actual in orbit

855
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,810
operational phase and also important to

856
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,640
us disposal as you might know we have to

857
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,820
guarantee that our spacecraft will be

858
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,250
disposed at the end of the lifespan

859
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,980
either by controlled deorbiting of the

860
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,860
spacecraft or by sending spacecraft that

861
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,410
are in a high geo stationary orbit we

862
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,820
sent them to a satellite graveyard but

863
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,490
you have to make sure there's no harm

864
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,090
coming from the products later on so

865
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,130
this is the mission of the organization

866
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,320
what is a product to us a product is not

867
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,470
only a satellite we deliver to a

868
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,320
customer or a launcher like Ariane 5 but

869
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,920
it could be anything that is a component

870
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,649
a platform a subsystem a payload

871
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,990
software a service we are more and we're

872
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:15,270
going into services but also even a

873
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,880
documentation so we have to protect it

874
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,190
two ways one nobody should steal our

875
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,640
intellectual property and also nobody

876
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:27,030
should inject malware at any given time

877
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,220
into our product so this is what we do

878
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,080
with a product and then we have a second

879
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,690
thing that we are currently focusing on

880
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,780
which we call product industrial tool

881
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,040
systems these are is the complete dual

882
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,300
chain we need

883
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:45,330
it to develop design build test maintain

884
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,510
and operate our products this is mostly

885
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,909
non standard IT equipment we call it OTA

886
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,920
equipment that is in our clean rooms in

887
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:55,590
our assembly integration and testing

888
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,180
facilities located special we call it

889
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,850
special check out equipments for

890
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:03,470
instance systems that are connected to

891
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:06,050
the satellite during the design test and

892
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,340
operational phase later on so we have

893
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,040
specific check out equipment we have

894
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,520
Mission Control segments so all these

895
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:18,180
systems are there to support the

896
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,710
satellite some of the products I would

897
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,990
like to show you we are dealing with

898
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,630
here I see here one of our products

899
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:27,540
which is a telecommunication spacecraft

900
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,780
the telecom satellite in geostationary

901
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:34,080
orbit we always thought that in at an

902
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:37,350
orbit of 36,000 kilometers the threats

903
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,820
are not so big we have done stringent

904
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,610
risk analysis and currently we are

905
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,310
evaluating all kind of vulnerabilities

906
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,100
also at that orbit so a set weapons as

907
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:50,520
mentioned before might be capable of

908
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:54,120
reaching this geostationary orbit soon

909
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:57,780
or even already so there is there is

910
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,590
even high out in space on the late lower

911
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:04,430
low Earth orbit space we have here a

912
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,840
series of satellites called Copernicus

913
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,860
which is a program from the European

914
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,750
Space Agency

915
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,540
it's a very good program it's an earth

916
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,400
observation program monitoring the earth

917
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,290
in different ways it's monitoring

918
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,060
biomass it's monitoring waves its

919
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,300
monitoring wind to get a comprehensive

920
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,130
picture on our earth consisting of a

921
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,230
large number of satellites we were

922
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,590
fortunate to win a number of those

923
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:33,418
contracts and produce this spacecraft

924
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:35,790
however this spacecraft are delivering

925
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:39,330
important data we have to make sure that

926
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:42,029
a data integrity is guaranteed so that

927
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:44,069
later on when this data is used for

928
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,510
scientific analysis the data that comes

929
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:49,880
down from the satellite is really the

930
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,880
data that the satellite has taken

931
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,379
man spaceflight as you might know we

932
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,480
have built the European Columbus module

933
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:01,089
as part of the International Space

934
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,380
Station last year we have celebrated 10

935
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,280
years of in orbit time of the module so

936
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,890
we see Austinites

937
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,000
astronauts there on orbit it's a very

938
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,710
very challenging thing we also operate

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,410
the Columbus module from the ground

940
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:22,330
facility inside is Columbus module you

941
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,440
see for instance a print brand new thing

942
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:30,130
because Simon which is a flying little

943
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:33,040
robot connected to IBM Watson's

944
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,430
artificial intelligence from space and

945
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,420
it's a personal companion of an

946
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:43,419
astronaut can support the astronaut in

947
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,720
vital activities can answer questions in

948
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,369
real time can also do other things like

949
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,009
playing the favorite music of an

950
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:54,369
astronaut or telling jokes so we had

951
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,200
this little robot in orbit lately he was

952
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,600
supporting Alexander Gerst the German

953
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,899
commander of the International Space

954
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,700
Station a few months ago so however this

955
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,940
is a very interesting product but it's

956
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:10,390
connected directly to the Internet so in

957
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:13,150
space and also men's space fight a new

958
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,670
American Orion mission we are supporting

959
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,790
your our mission by building the service

960
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,820
module and we were building our own

961
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:25,000
launcher the European launcher it's the

962
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:28,180
currently the Ariane 5 and underway and

963
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,970
soon to be launched is the Ariane 6 a

964
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,740
brand new generation of launchers also

965
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,540
my colleagues at Argonne coop which is a

966
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,930
joint venture between suppliers around

967
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,270
edibles they are taking care of the

968
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:43,540
cybersecurity of this launcher and last

969
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:47,800
not least a new challenge for us there's

970
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:49,900
a joint venture with one web where one

971
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,369
web would like to bring internet

972
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:56,820
high-speed Internet to the whole planet

973
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:59,650
by a large-scale constellation of

974
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,540
low-earth orbiting satellites but the

975
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,310
constellation the final phase will

976
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:08,470
consist of about 950 satellites and will

977
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,509
cover the whole the whole earth as

978
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,330
mentioned with high speed internet

979
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,330
imagine if you have a cyberattack on

980
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:18,130
this constellation of 950 satellites and

981
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,859
a cyberattack for any reason would be

982
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,920
successful you have worst case a lot of

983
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,779
space debris so we're taking a lot of

984
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,780
measures to protect these constellations

985
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,150
how do we protect them this is a small

986
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:39,100
brain sorry for that but he's showing

987
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:43,630
the full life cycle of a typical space

988
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:47,980
product from very early stages up to R&D

989
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:50,770
then defining a proposal deciding a

990
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,990
system building the system testing the

991
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,570
system we spend a lot of time in what we

992
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,580
call assembly integration and testing in

993
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,200
our clean rooms you know because as soon

994
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,810
as the satellite is launched and in

995
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,060
orbit it's very hard to reach yeah you

996
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:07,450
would need some kind of service

997
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,549
satellite which is not there yet so we

998
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,299
have to make sure that the satellite is

999
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:16,960
capable of performing also under

1000
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,100
situations that are not foreseen and all

1001
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,630
the way to the end we have the

1002
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,680
operational phase which is very

1003
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,780
important it becomes more and more

1004
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,089
important for us to protect operational

1005
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,770
phase of the spacecraft and all the way

1006
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,530
in the end we have to take care that we

1007
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,890
secure the boss city spacecraft as that

1008
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,990
either burning up in the atmosphere or

1009
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:37,330
moving it to a graveyard orbit and the

1010
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,700
thing is we would like we would like to

1011
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,830
be the people who d orbital spacecraft I

1012
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,750
would not want to have a hacker do

1013
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,560
operating by spacecraft by hacking into

1014
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:49,750
my satellite so what are we going to do

1015
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,359
about that we have a wide range of

1016
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,980
activities we do a lot of security risk

1017
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,250
assessments currently we're booting

1018
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:01,030
security requirements into our products

1019
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:04,000
we design secure architectures and

1020
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,520
design new ways of protecting our

1021
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,320
spacecraft also in the operations we

1022
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:13,120
look into how can we protect our

1023
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,420
operations and we have a wide range of

1024
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,069
active

1025
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,390
with our colleagues from IT security

1026
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:20,920
from site security from digital security

1027
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,710
we all work very closely together to

1028
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,690
ensure this security one thing I would

1029
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,510
like to show you one specific activity

1030
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,940
is secure the check one of the chains we

1031
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,569
have here the chain from enterprise

1032
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,890
automation systems everything that runs

1033
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,960
our buildings for instance

1034
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,400
air-conditioned we have a large need of

1035
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,960
clean air in a clean room of course

1036
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,849
meant to make sure that the air

1037
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,690
conditioned system in such a clean room

1038
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:46,540
is protected

1039
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,430
nobody can hack into the system and for

1040
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,960
instance change the quality of the air

1041
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,569
that might be not very good for a

1042
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,839
satellite also a fire suppression

1043
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:58,720
systems power systems etc the second

1044
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,509
piece that we are doing is look into all

1045
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,459
our production public industrial tool

1046
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:06,220
systems there are the systems we need to

1047
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,980
build tests maintain our satellites we

1048
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,410
do a very large effort currently and in

1049
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:16,089
the end the last thing is all flows into

1050
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:18,879
the product itself the satellite so what

1051
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:20,799
are we doing as mentioned we have 16

1052
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,869
sites in Europe where we build

1053
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:25,420
satellites or satellite payloads or

1054
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:27,670
equipment and we go currently from side

1055
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,420
to side and do a thorough risk

1056
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:35,160
assessment basically based on an ISO

1057
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:38,260
27000 and five risk methodology and we

1058
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,480
together with our business owners we

1059
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,940
decide what are our critical assets or

1060
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,790
crown jewels we do a risk assessment on

1061
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,880
them we have here a little risk payable

1062
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:51,700
it shows if the the impact and the

1063
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,829
likelihood of such a risk is height and

1064
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,629
we go very deep and together with our

1065
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:58,270
business and the stakeholders in our

1066
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:01,660
company we develop risk treatment plans

1067
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:05,319
and this we do at every site for all our

1068
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,618
for all our pits environment that goes

1069
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:10,540
down to SPS systems to robots to CNC

1070
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:13,119
machines to special check out equipment

1071
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,329
etc a lot of action we have done a lot

1072
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,220
of this already we have seen a lot of

1073
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:22,809
interesting facts legacy systems that

1074
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,118
are not so well protected to today's

1075
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,519
standards but we do that ongoing this is

1076
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,529
an

1077
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:32,899
an ongoing plan do check act cycle so

1078
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:36,409
we're working hard on that so what do we

1079
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:39,019
do our job is to ensure that appropriate

1080
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:41,359
measures are in place to protect our

1081
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:44,629
products and services how I do it we

1082
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,159
have a holistic approach we have also

1083
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,329
all the governance in place in our

1084
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:52,099
company and also we do it for our

1085
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,359
customers and make sure that our

1086
00:41:52,099 --> 00:42:06,199
products are secure so thank you

1087
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:07,939
question please thank you very much it

1088
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,089
seems you have your work cut out for you

1089
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:10,089
anyway

1090
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:21,409
do we have any short clarification type

1091
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:23,569
questions yes there is one in the back

1092
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:28,189
there so if you would say who you are

1093
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:29,749
and make it brief question from guard

1094
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,709
time just a very practical question do

1095
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:34,448
you think the attack that James

1096
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:37,038
described would work or to be maybe

1097
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:38,959
gentler to your products what are the

1098
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,669
types of failures that a customer would

1099
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,899
need to have or what are the ways in

1100
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:44,388
which they wouldn't need to follow your

1101
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:49,339
guidelines to allow that type of attack

1102
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:53,089
to work so correctly what the customer

1103
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:54,349
would need to do we have we are going

1104
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:57,019
and working closely with our customers

1105
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,209
especially our civilian customers to

1106
00:42:57,019 --> 00:43:01,968
bring the awareness of cyber threats to

1107
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:03,529
their products and we make sure that the

1108
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:06,259
requirements we get from the customer in

1109
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:08,239
the future will be at a certain level to

1110
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:11,539
make sure that the product is protected

1111
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,619
in the end and for us it's important

1112
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:14,299
that we have the requirements from the

1113
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:17,359
customers because if we implement our

1114
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:19,909
own requirements that might be below a

1115
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,409
threshold and we would like of course if

1116
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:23,899
the customers and the customer is

1117
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:26,119
understanding the risk to the product

1118
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:28,328
and also might be willing to pay for a

1119
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,679
little bit more security in the product

1120
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:32,569
so military customers fully understand

1121
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,130
that civilian customers it's not so easy

1122
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,719
currently we go out and do a lot of

1123
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,079
awareness campaigns with our civilian

1124
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,079
customers

1125
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,470
thank you I think we can move now to our

1126
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,359
last speaker last but not least I've

1127
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,819
done a candle henry heron from the nato

1128
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,880
joint air power competence center you

1129
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,280
are a strategist and you are going to

1130
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,890
give us the military perspective a

1131
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,580
holistic military perspective on these

1132
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:03,549
various threats and opportunities may be

1133
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:07,569
as well so please thank you I have no

1134
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,830
slides so this is a more a more informal

1135
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,870
presentation I'm gonna stay see that if

1136
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,529
that's all right I have to start with a

1137
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,750
disclaimer

1138
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,820
so anything I'm about to say there's my

1139
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:19,090
views not the views of the Air Force or

1140
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:22,450
the DoD or the US government or NATO or

1141
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:24,550
the Jeff CC like thank you for the

1142
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:28,689
opportunity to be here from the CCDC OE

1143
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:30,760
it's it's always nice when someone seeks

1144
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:34,630
out your opinion it's a it's a good

1145
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,580
feeling I had prepared formal comments I

1146
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,250
had a speech all written having been

1147
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,370
here this week I spent most of last

1148
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,690
night rewriting it multiple times

1149
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,549
because of all the the things I've heard

1150
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,610
and the other keynote speakers and the

1151
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:51,670
other panelists trying to adapt to what

1152
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,960
I've heard and and and what I've picked

1153
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,230
up from the other speakers and in

1154
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,820
sidebar conversations I'm not gonna use

1155
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,210
that they say in the airforce

1156
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,560
flexibility is a key to airpower and

1157
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,630
indecision is a key to flexibility so

1158
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,730
I'm just I've got some notes and I'm

1159
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,820
gonna I'm gonna go through there I'll

1160
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:13,360
start first with James's paper or the

1161
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,000
academic research I find this type of

1162
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,950
research crucial as we move forward I

1163
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,570
think putting the time in to research a

1164
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,930
project and to come up with conclusions

1165
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:29,260
is something that we will need as we

1166
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,870
continue to go forward and I think the

1167
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,040
one thing I would add to that is that

1168
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,080
perhaps there's sometimes too much

1169
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,970
separation between the military side and

1170
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,590
the academic side and we can always do

1171
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:41,830
more with collaboration so as these

1172
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:44,200
papers are are being developed to seek

1173
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,540
out military or even law enforcement

1174
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,520
professionals to to get input and in

1175
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,360
that front-loaded side of it so that we

1176
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,240
get

1177
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,360
operational mindset versus just the the

1178
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,100
technical aspects even as accurate as

1179
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,570
the technical aspects of the arguments

1180
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:03,880
can be James laid out definitely a way

1181
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:06,820
and I appreciate his his higher level

1182
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,000
thought into the research that that you

1183
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,550
do have vulnerabilities in space due to

1184
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,560
cyberspace capabilities and he

1185
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,060
demonstrated a way in which those

1186
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,290
vulnerabilities could be exploited I

1187
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,330
think it's important that we focus on

1188
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:25,360
that it's just a way right he presented

1189
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,430
a way to attack a satellite from a

1190
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,280
military perspective I may not always be

1191
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,899
concerned with the satellite itself

1192
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,670
right I might be concerned more with the

1193
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,680
payload some of the things that Robert

1194
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:38,160
talked about this the service the

1195
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,850
capability on the satellite and so

1196
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,770
there's going to be cyber

1197
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:44,020
vulnerabilities to those types of things

1198
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,930
as well so when you look at the approach

1199
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,520
the specific research the the James laid

1200
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,350
out I I agree with what he said I think

1201
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,600
he said it was a slow burn right and so

1202
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,950
that's it's definitely a long game right

1203
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,839
that's something that that you're not

1204
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,609
gonna do overnight that's you're gonna

1205
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,110
take months perhaps even years to

1206
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:03,580
achieve an effect on an overall vehicle

1207
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:05,290
which may be something that you want to

1208
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,870
do depending on the mission that you

1209
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,610
find yourself in but if you're trying to

1210
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:12,520
do something what what I would term

1211
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,020
weren't operationally timely more

1212
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,580
operation relevant something that's

1213
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,100
going to be quicker you might want to

1214
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,720
focus more on the capabilities of the

1215
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,150
satellite versus the vehicle itself

1216
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,830
which I think the research that you did

1217
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:30,460
leaves that that open that possibility

1218
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:34,150
as far as the term cyber ASAT so I think

1219
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:37,630
this this for me as a strategist by duty

1220
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,880
title this is where I start to have

1221
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:45,580
concerns and I've heard speakers this

1222
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,410
week talk about we can't apply cyber to

1223
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:51,370
every problem because not everything is

1224
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,899
a cyber issue right and so my focus when

1225
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:56,109
I start talking about ACS is more on the

1226
00:47:52,900 --> 00:48:01,210
a set piece I think about how I either

1227
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:03,130
need to defend friendly satellites or or

1228
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,070
attack adversary satellites right

1229
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,020
inhibit their capabilities the method in

1230
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,270
which I go about doing that is then a

1231
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,000
secondary or tertiary consideration

1232
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,680
right my focus first of all foremost is

1233
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,330
on what I'm trying to achieve within my

1234
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,040
mission so I get concerned within the

1235
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:24,549
cyber community but also within the

1236
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,890
space community when we see we see this

1237
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:29,920
labeling of space effects and cyber

1238
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:32,890
effects and cyber ASAT I think that that

1239
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,860
puts us on a dangerous path I say that

1240
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:39,040
because because we start thinking about

1241
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,240
our capability first and as we start

1242
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,870
thinking about that it affects our

1243
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,580
thought processes right and it those

1244
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,100
thought processes that affect the

1245
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,140
actions that we ultimately take right so

1246
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,759
if I'm going around thinking cyber cyber

1247
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,190
cyber well then I'm only gonna look at

1248
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,500
everything through a cyber lens and an

1249
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,940
operational mindset I don't think that

1250
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,800
that's gonna necessarily be helpful in

1251
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,480
the long term right I need to take a

1252
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,820
more holistic approach I need to start

1253
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,580
with the adversary the effect I'm trying

1254
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,290
to generate in the adversary and work my

1255
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,750
way backwards and then look at the range

1256
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:13,540
of capabilities I have according to the

1257
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,280
mission constraints to achieve that

1258
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,710
mission right and that may very well be

1259
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,590
cyber right it may be a cyber capability

1260
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,210
but when we put cyber or and it we do

1261
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,460
this in the space community I think too

1262
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,830
much as well when we put those terms up

1263
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,720
front I think I think we start off on

1264
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,490
the wrong foot we're starting it off at

1265
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,660
the wrong end of the problem and perhaps

1266
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:36,640
painting ourselves in a corner in my

1267
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,430
mind and maybe other folks would

1268
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,150
disagree in my mind that the dangers in

1269
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:46,299
this I think back to the 1990s within

1270
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,250
the US Air Force we adapted a quality

1271
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,250
mindset approach right there was a lot

1272
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,410
of business in the u.s. had taken some

1273
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,120
thoughts really from Japan and the idea

1274
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,879
that and we can do this quality approach

1275
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,190
to improve our processes to improve the

1276
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,650
way we go about doing things and it was

1277
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:05,440
a great tool but that's what it was it

1278
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:07,300
was it was a tool that you could use in

1279
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,230
some situations to make improvements

1280
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,670
right we went way overboard in this and

1281
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,650
we got to the point where we had people

1282
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,170
walking around just living and breathing

1283
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,940
quality

1284
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,470
and they started to mistake the mission

1285
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,349
of the air force of the mission of their

1286
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:25,348
organizations as a mission of quality

1287
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:27,299
which was not the case right and it took

1288
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:29,099
us a number of years to to work through

1289
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:31,140
that and and for the pendulum to kind of

1290
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,569
swing back and for us to remember that

1291
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,609
that our mission is the Air Force is not

1292
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:38,069
quality it's that's simply a tool that

1293
00:50:35,609 --> 00:50:39,750
we can use so within the military that's

1294
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:42,359
that's something that I get concerned

1295
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,760
about as I see us putting these labels

1296
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,348
of space first or cyber first I think

1297
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,480
back to those difficulties we

1298
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:50,400
encountered that that as a holistic

1299
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,589
military approach I can't always put

1300
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,329
those things up front because then I

1301
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:58,920
start to loose focus on what my actual

1302
00:50:54,329 --> 00:51:01,079
mission is and it's it's easy to do

1303
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,760
right now I think because these

1304
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,579
capabilities space capabilities

1305
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,309
cyberspace could their new where we're

1306
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,710
trying to grasp for an understanding of

1307
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:13,079
how they fit in right and it's not easy

1308
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,180
to wrap our nuggets around it right - to

1309
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,940
really get into what it means to

1310
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:20,940
maneuver through cyberspace or to use

1311
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,339
fires in cyberspace right to produce an

1312
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,559
effect we have a hard time picturing now

1313
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:27,480
we think of popular culture we think you

1314
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,609
know the matrix or or we think of other

1315
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,640
movies or books maybe we've read but it

1316
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:34,319
it's hard to draw those analogies and so

1317
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,200
as we're we're grasping with those

1318
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:40,619
thoughts we definitely need to make sure

1319
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,419
we're we're in the right lane as far as

1320
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:46,559
focusing on what we're trying to achieve

1321
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,569
and there's a difference that I see for

1322
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,380
me looking at that versus the academic

1323
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:54,000
world or the commercial world right we

1324
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,160
have different approaches because we

1325
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,109
have different missions right James is

1326
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,730
out there trying to just produce new

1327
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:01,589
thoughts and and get a better

1328
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,819
understanding of the world obviously

1329
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:04,710
there's a commercial interest on the

1330
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,990
industry side but for me I don't

1331
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,630
necessarily have those same motivations

1332
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,640
right so so the the way in which I use

1333
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:15,170
the terms needs to be different if I'm

1334
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,640
going to be effective in my job I think

1335
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:20,730
the subject of the panel here is space

1336
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,520
and cyberspace so if I take a step back

1337
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:26,099
and look at how cyberspace and space are

1338
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,800
connected or how they're related

1339
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:30,420
I really think it's

1340
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,730
in the bureaucracies of our governments

1341
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,190
it's it's there both information age

1342
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,020
capabilities and that ties in with

1343
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:39,180
things that we do in the electromagnetic

1344
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,830
spectrum and and we had some panels

1345
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,080
yesterday on information operations or

1346
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:45,120
information warfare all of these types

1347
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,049
of things these these areas in which we

1348
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,549
operate our new and and not everybody

1349
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:54,030
understands them and they're grouped

1350
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:57,900
together and they don't have champions

1351
00:52:54,030 --> 00:53:00,090
they don't have services we have armies

1352
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,340
we have navies we have air forces right

1353
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,550
so within our within our separate

1354
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:08,430
countries the nations are organized

1355
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,770
along those domains land air and sea and

1356
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:13,140
and that's where the funding funnels

1357
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,810
into right so so those are the folks

1358
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,040
that have a seat at the table to be able

1359
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,380
to put forward an argument for

1360
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,050
capability or for concept development

1361
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:25,260
right they have that right through just

1362
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:28,380
historic precedents but for space for

1363
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,850
cyberspace for e/m operations

1364
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,440
electromagnetic operations information

1365
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,810
operations they don't have a seat at the

1366
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,330
table right they're all secondary they

1367
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:39,920
have to work through those folks at the

1368
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:42,750
table to get resourcing to get funding

1369
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,840
to really give it a sense of importance

1370
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:48,870
and that may tie to why we see so much

1371
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,520
of this this labeling of space and

1372
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,710
cyberspace out in front of everything

1373
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,200
because we're really trying to argue for

1374
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:58,980
a seat at the table for recognition that

1375
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,569
we have we have a role to play and again

1376
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,120
I just think there's a danger that we

1377
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,320
could take that too far but it's

1378
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,650
definitely something that we need to

1379
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:11,190
consider and and I think we need to we

1380
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:12,870
need to be careful about really kind of

1381
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,640
having a sibling rivalry within those

1382
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:18,210
information age capabilities right we

1383
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,400
can't focus too much on one I've heard

1384
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:22,920
arguments before and I'm sure I'll hear

1385
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,450
them again you know everything we saw in

1386
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,010
James's presentation right space is all

1387
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:28,200
important right it's the ultimate high

1388
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,670
ground right but we also hear cyberspace

1389
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,109
well everything is connected through

1390
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,660
cyberspace you can't do anything without

1391
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:36,060
cyberspace and again this to me seems to

1392
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,710
just be another argument for for that

1393
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,130
seat at the table right hey we're so

1394
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:42,570
important please pay attention give us a

1395
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,510
seat at the table give us a seat

1396
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:48,030
in the discussion but in doing that

1397
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,410
sometimes we're we're nudging the other

1398
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,480
guys out of the way right the other guys

1399
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:54,569
that are also looking for that same

1400
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:58,950
relevance that same ability to take part

1401
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:00,570
in the decision-making process and one

1402
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,859
way that I think it shows it most

1403
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,780
importantly and kind of circling back

1404
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,930
maybe a little bit is into this lexicon

1405
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,000
idea right so cyber ASAT I you know it's

1406
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:12,060
an a set that's what it is right the the

1407
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,670
mission is to go after a space system

1408
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,440
right the the capability that I use to

1409
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,660
do that that that's a secondary thing I

1410
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,120
don't need to get into that we use

1411
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,799
kinetic and non kinetic or those terms

1412
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,020
really applicable anymore I new I think

1413
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,180
we've seen through world examples where

1414
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:30,960
you can use cyberspace capabilities and

1415
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:32,960
produce kinetic effects right so so

1416
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,030
that's not necessarily helpful to us

1417
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,490
anymore we have to have to look at the

1418
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,490
fact that the words we're using have

1419
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:42,839
have real implications right there is a

1420
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,970
wise man in my community once that words

1421
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,470
mean stuff you know we really have to

1422
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,629
think about that so I think sometimes we

1423
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,990
need to take a step back and really

1424
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,910
listen to the words that we're using in

1425
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:56,040
these information age capabilities and

1426
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,200
and try to have an understanding about

1427
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,960
those things are we are we making new

1428
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,759
terms up making new words up because

1429
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,740
it's really something that's so

1430
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,900
different from the traditional military

1431
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,669
capabilities or is it that we're just

1432
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,470
trying to make it stand out and make it

1433
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,930
sound a little special are we using the

1434
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:15,500
words correctly I don't know that that's

1435
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:20,310
not always the case

1436
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:23,400
and then lastly the and kind of sticking

1437
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,360
with this idea of of the sibling rivalry

1438
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,120
Marcoses

1439
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:30,000
we can't treat the different domains as

1440
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:32,100
utilities right we have to look at them

1441
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,200
operationally right what we're doing in

1442
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:37,140
space today is heavily reliant on

1443
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,720
cyberspace and it's reliant on

1444
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,819
cyberspace as a utility but that doesn't

1445
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,100
make cyberspace a utility right

1446
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,720
cyberspace is an operational domain

1447
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,700
according to NATO and according to many

1448
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,740
of the member nations and space is an

1449
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,960
operational domain not to NATO at this

1450
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,810
point but to some of the member nations

1451
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,069
so there's a difference between how we

1452
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:58,920
use these doe

1453
00:56:56,069 --> 00:57:01,440
means to conduct operations and then how

1454
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,390
we use them to support operations and we

1455
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,999
can't lock ourselves into only looking

1456
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,348
at the supporting role we have to be

1457
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:09,390
able to understand that there are times

1458
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:11,640
when these are supported missions as

1459
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:16,469
well even from the traditional domains

1460
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:20,459
of air land and sea enclosing here I'm

1461
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:23,190
gonna end with a quote Nietzsche once

1462
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:26,609
said one must still have chaos and one

1463
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:29,190
to give birth to a dancing star that's

1464
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,959
been more commonly rephrase to say you

1465
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,949
know out of chaos comes order and I

1466
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:34,019
think that's where we find ourselves

1467
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:37,049
today we find ourselves in the chaos and

1468
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,149
the emerging and the developing and an

1469
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:40,259
evolution of these capabilities and

1470
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,819
we're trying to figure out how they all

1471
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:44,069
fit together and how they fit into the

1472
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:47,099
world that we've known previously and we

1473
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:49,469
have to be able to to work together to

1474
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,839
bring order to all of this and and that

1475
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:54,119
it will eventually come I think it'll

1476
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,529
come maybe by taking a step back and

1477
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:57,809
looking at the lexicon looking at the

1478
00:57:55,529 --> 00:58:00,329
words we're using and how we communicate

1479
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:02,549
with one another and and then finding

1480
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:04,859
finding our lane what's our role and

1481
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:07,259
being being happy and comfortable in

1482
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:09,269
that role and realizing that that we

1483
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:12,449
don't have to set ourselves up as the

1484
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:14,819
utmost important contributor but really

1485
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:18,990
is just part of a team a team player

1486
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:23,800
going forward that's all I have

1487
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:26,509
[Applause]

1488
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,359
thank you very much now as a lawyer who

1489
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:31,280
works on creating lower for for

1490
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,470
different types of technologies what I'm

1491
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,270
always preaching is this at lawyers

1492
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,680
called technology neutrality and that's

1493
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:38,780
really what you were talking about we're

1494
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,970
not to focus on on different terms and

1495
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,859
so it's always nice to hear clever

1496
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:47,000
people say the same kind of things you

1497
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:49,910
say so a short question or two to Henry

1498
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:57,020
before we open the debate discussion

1499
00:58:49,910 --> 00:59:00,649
generally any if not in that case any

1500
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:03,560
thoughts comments questions to all of

1501
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,510
the or any altogether of our

1502
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,640
participants I think what you said it's

1503
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,890
what was very very correct and I think

1504
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,020
we should probably thank um my former

1505
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,940
student for that that we have a very

1506
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,599
good panel that really combines

1507
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:19,930
different aspects there any I have many

1508
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:26,450
questions but I'm not going to sort of

1509
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:28,190
use my my privilege yes and we have a

1510
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,399
microphone coming I think and please say

1511
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:36,790
briefly who who you are as well so okay

1512
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:39,440
the song hi bill Brett student UMBC

1513
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:42,349
we have representative from industry

1514
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,140
here and I know at least in the the US

1515
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:48,080
there's a strong concern over supply

1516
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:52,069
chain security resilience the US

1517
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:54,140
Department of Defense has stated a term

1518
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:58,339
called deliver uncompromised which is

1519
00:59:54,140 --> 01:00:01,520
beginning to affect our industry so as

1520
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:05,740
the industry perspective you're having

1521
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:09,020
to build something as a corporation with

1522
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:11,270
economic interest at play obviously and

1523
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,040
then looking through your discussion on

1524
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:17,050
the military I really appreciated that

1525
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:19,849
I'm a former military and the military

1526
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:22,790
bit into a lot of business theory early

1527
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,770
on they're correcting back now but how

1528
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,960
do you reconcile

1529
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,790
for example the acquisition process in

1530
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,790
which security and resiliency in both

1531
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:33,770
cyber security space hardening that sort

1532
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,720
of thing

1533
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:40,250
the needs and requirements versus the

1534
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:48,830
cost perhaps if you remember the

1535
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:53,150
question but maybe we'll still thinking

1536
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:56,690
about it okay in that case maybe I can

1537
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:59,690
answer securing the supply chain is one

1538
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:01,460
of our top notch topics currently so as

1539
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,690
mentioned before especially in Europe we

1540
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,109
have this unique situation we have a

1541
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:07,910
very diversified supplier structure and

1542
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:10,250
we have suppliers that are not very

1543
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:12,348
advanced in space business they come

1544
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:15,380
from more traditional of development for

1545
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:17,960
instance so we we are working together

1546
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,180
with our partners in industry also with

1547
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,400
the partners and customers like European

1548
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:25,129
Space Agency to make sure we have two

1549
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,310
knives and a fitting governance process

1550
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:30,530
built into the supply chain but we are

1551
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:34,099
at the beginning currently so I can tell

1552
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:36,380
you a specific example we had forward we

1553
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:38,780
wanted to test this bits approach to the

1554
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,910
supply chain so I went to one of the

1555
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:44,119
suppliers of one of our main software

1556
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:47,089
component for our products I check you

1557
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:49,190
supplier he was in Denmark went to him

1558
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:51,290
and said please show me how do you

1559
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,420
protect your software how can you

1560
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,940
guarantee the software you build and

1561
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,580
delivered to us is the correct one it's

1562
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,530
virus free it's it's not had not changed

1563
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:04,640
and all the integrity is there and so on

1564
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:07,310
and he said I can yes but only for what

1565
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,069
I have done because this guy has a

1566
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:11,660
supplier who is developing a lot of the

1567
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,040
software and the supplier was in a

1568
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,529
different country in that case in

1569
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,359
Austria so I went to the supplier is

1570
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:18,619
that guys show me what are you doing how

1571
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,470
do you do software development how do

1572
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:24,020
you protect your environment they were

1573
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:26,419
less advanced than the main supplier and

1574
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,980
then they told me about by the way the

1575
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,260
main part of our software is not

1576
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:33,560
developed here in Vienna but in Romania

1577
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:35,960
so I had to go to Romania to a very

1578
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,290
small company have a look at them and

1579
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,450
say guys you build a core a core element

1580
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:44,089
of my product how do you protect it and

1581
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:46,310
I was very surprised that they have a

1582
01:02:44,089 --> 01:02:47,420
super protection in place they were

1583
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:50,150
fully ISO 20

1584
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,430
I wasn't compliant so this was good good

1585
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:54,260
news yeah but this is only an isolated

1586
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:56,299
case so we we need to make sure that

1587
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,670
this happens now for all the suppliers

1588
01:02:56,299 --> 01:03:00,380
we need to have a process in place so we

1589
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:02,660
are talking with other industries

1590
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,480
currently like with a German automotive

1591
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:08,359
manufacturer industry VD aid they have

1592
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:11,180
the same issue with the controls for

1593
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:13,549
their for their automatic control units

1594
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,899
the control everything in the car they

1595
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:16,400
have lots of different black boxes with

1596
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,200
software in there from different

1597
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,799
suppliers they have invented a process

1598
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,299
over the last few years and also a

1599
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:25,220
mechanisms to ensure that they have the

1600
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:28,369
right place for audits in place by

1601
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:30,140
external parties and when they get their

1602
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:32,030
components and the software this is

1603
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:34,490
built to an appropriate security level

1604
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:36,589
so we think we will join forces with

1605
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,359
these other industries see what they

1606
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:43,578
have done take the best practices and

1607
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:45,828
implement them in space I would add I

1608
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:48,770
think again within this idea of

1609
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:51,079
information age capabilities in many

1610
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:53,839
cases we're trying to drive the car

1611
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:56,869
while we build it and and so within

1612
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:58,130
within our structures we use the

1613
01:03:56,869 --> 01:04:00,230
structure actually go based from

1614
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,940
Napoleon right so the the three function

1615
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:04,790
is the operations function and the five

1616
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,140
is the planning function and as we see

1617
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:08,720
these new capabilities come onboard

1618
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:10,670
there's always a push to get get folks

1619
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,770
into the three as quick as possible into

1620
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:14,690
the current operations hey you've

1621
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:18,049
developed a widget and we can use it

1622
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:19,579
because we we have a we have a match in

1623
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:21,770
the battle space somewhere out there

1624
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:25,309
where that that's applicable and we

1625
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:27,530
force that in there the problem is with

1626
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,030
these new TF abilities for at least from

1627
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,339
my perspective is that a lot of times

1628
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:33,349
they're they're very specific right

1629
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:34,970
there are their exquisite capabilities

1630
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:39,680
and they're they're functional on a

1631
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:41,328
specific situation and what we maybe

1632
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,129
should be looking to do is put more

1633
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:45,559
people in the five right in that

1634
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:49,250
planning function where you can get

1635
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:51,220
baked in to the long-term plans for

1636
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:53,569
military operations and then that drives

1637
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,910
capability development through the

1638
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:58,700
requirements process and then you can

1639
01:04:55,910 --> 01:05:00,589
then you can actually have a wider range

1640
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:03,319
of capabilities that are applicable

1641
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:05,420
in a host of military operations versus

1642
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:07,038
starting with that exquisite capability

1643
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,199
and then trying to figure out different

1644
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,699
ways that you could use it and that

1645
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,259
seems to be something that I don't think

1646
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:14,599
is unique to space or to cyberspace

1647
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:16,189
anytime we get a new capability we we

1648
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,099
rush it to ops instead of really letting

1649
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:20,989
it get baked into our plans but when we

1650
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:22,489
do that then I think then that goes to

1651
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:31,670
your question that we're able to then

1652
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:33,469
handle those types of things in Catina

1653
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,019
park from the NATO Defense College I

1654
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:38,089
wondered if the panelists could comment

1655
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:40,879
about the role of artificial

1656
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:43,699
intelligence revolution as we ponder

1657
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,299
about cyber and space because Simon for

1658
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:50,959
instance reminded me of you know how and

1659
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:54,288
how potentially if a non-state terror

1660
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:58,279
group or some unknown entity intercepted

1661
01:05:54,289 --> 01:06:01,189
and in a you know hypothetical situation

1662
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:04,039
if we had to make a decision you know

1663
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:07,759
there is a human factor but sometimes it

1664
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:10,400
may be unclear or we may have to make a

1665
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:12,979
decision very quickly and at that point

1666
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:18,049
just as a layperson who is not an expert

1667
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:21,288
on space related capabilities I wondered

1668
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:23,959
where we are generally speaking from

1669
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:25,819
your respective fields on dealing with

1670
01:06:23,959 --> 01:06:32,178
new challenges coming from the eye

1671
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:34,249
revolution so I'm not remotely expert

1672
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:36,589
but I guess one thing that I would talk

1673
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:39,589
about is we used genetic algorithm in

1674
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:41,209
designing our attack and for us that was

1675
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:42,920
this wasn't an AI paper this wasn't

1676
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:44,509
focused on AI I it was simply a tool

1677
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,219
that saved me the trouble of having to

1678
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:48,799
learn orbital physics and I think that

1679
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:50,749
AI takes a lot of that complexity and

1680
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,150
provides general purpose tools that

1681
01:06:50,749 --> 01:06:58,399
might decrease the cost of understanding

1682
01:06:53,150 --> 01:07:02,479
these esoteric domains we as a company

1683
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:05,089
taking a lot of actions currently into

1684
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:07,669
the research in AI because you believe

1685
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:10,279
this is beneficial to us also if you

1686
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:14,330
look currently our spacecraft are not

1687
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:16,910
very intelligent they are based on

1688
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:18,200
set of procedures and commands and if

1689
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:20,210
you have a loss of communication for

1690
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,160
instance usually a spacecraft is acting

1691
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:24,350
very simply going in a safe mode for

1692
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,140
instance build a mission in the future

1693
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:29,299
we have more intelligent spacecraft with

1694
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,339
some kind of AI capability to take

1695
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,840
decisions on their own especially if

1696
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:35,480
they are on missions that are away from

1697
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:38,270
from our deep-space missions and we're

1698
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:41,890
looking at deeply but this is just at

1699
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,890
the beginning in this kind of research

1700
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:47,600
I'm definitely a expert either but I

1701
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:50,390
guess I would I would just echo what I

1702
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,839
previously said rather it is gonna it is

1703
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:57,170
coming it's gonna happen and and how we

1704
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:59,180
how we integrate AI fact capabilities

1705
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:01,310
into operations needs to be baked into

1706
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:05,720
the plans I I think there's going to be

1707
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:10,490
a potential to change the way we think

1708
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:12,109
about planning right now within the

1709
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:14,209
military there's there's a big focus on

1710
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:16,580
command and control right and the and at

1711
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:19,250
the highest levels right we use generals

1712
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,830
are watching UAVs watching missions

1713
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,950
there's a famous picture many of you may

1714
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:26,870
have seen with President Obama watching

1715
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:28,279
footage of the Osama bin Laden takedown

1716
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:30,519
right I mean they had overhead and he's

1717
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:34,819
watching that real-time right

1718
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:38,150
but as systems become more and more self

1719
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,500
dependent through AI capability the

1720
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:41,179
adversaries are going to have that to

1721
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,399
them you have to assume that and so

1722
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:45,609
you're gonna have to command to control

1723
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:48,439
more and more as a planning function

1724
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:50,060
then as a real-time operation function

1725
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,429
because as soon as you start to put a

1726
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:54,500
human in the loop or keep a human in the

1727
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:56,870
loop the humans not going to be fast

1728
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,689
enough to react right so so we're gonna

1729
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,939
have to redress how we approach command

1730
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:04,279
and control and we may have to look back

1731
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:06,169
to to how it was done previously I mean

1732
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:07,608
you look in the Second World War when

1733
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,950
Carrier Strike groups were sent out in

1734
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:10,940
the Pacific they weren't commanded

1735
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:12,858
controlled all the way through right

1736
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,870
they were given mission orders and sent

1737
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:17,270
off to conduct their mission and we're

1738
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:19,939
gonna have to figure out ways to think

1739
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:21,260
about how we do that with with systems

1740
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:24,500
that are going to be similar we're gonna

1741
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:27,170
have to send them out and let them do

1742
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,990
their mission in a safe effective

1743
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:31,640
that's gonna take a lot of trust but but

1744
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:35,630
it will cause us to I think to rethink

1745
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:39,009
how how we approach operations thank you

1746
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:43,330
any other questions yes

1747
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:43,330
wait for the microphone coming

1748
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:52,639
we thank you very much my name is Marcus

1749
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:55,280
mother from the Japanese mr. diffuser

1750
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:58,190
and I'd like to ask to each panelist

1751
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,579
whether what would be the most dangerous

1752
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:05,419
scenario you may be able to come up with

1753
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:08,269
using a cyber capability to disrupt your

1754
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:11,449
space system or architecture or other

1755
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:14,060
mine your mission if you may say the

1756
01:10:11,449 --> 01:10:17,089
unit avoid such a scenario what we can

1757
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:36,739
do at this moment I mean today to

1758
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:39,020
prevent such a worst-case scenario maybe

1759
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:40,579
you can't I think the worst thing we do

1760
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,230
is remain static right

1761
01:10:40,579 --> 01:10:46,159
I mean it's we've heard throughout the

1762
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:46,968
course of the week sorry all the all the

1763
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,129
different comments from the other

1764
01:10:46,969 --> 01:10:52,969
speakers kind of blend together at one

1765
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:54,290
moment but we can do defense and we can

1766
01:10:52,969 --> 01:10:56,659
do defense to a point but the

1767
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:58,099
adversaries they're they're thinking and

1768
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:59,449
they're adapting right we were there

1769
01:10:58,099 --> 01:11:01,969
we're probably not going to see the same

1770
01:10:59,449 --> 01:11:04,159
types of attacks repeated right because

1771
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:06,679
they're they're learning as well and so

1772
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,019
to stay static and think that our

1773
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:11,150
firewall or is you know Norton is going

1774
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,800
to take care of everything that's that's

1775
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:14,598
probably the most dangerous thing we we

1776
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,449
really have to understand that this is

1777
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:19,070
an evolving security situation and it

1778
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:24,199
will continue to evolve and we're gonna

1779
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:25,880
have to continue to adapt I guess I

1780
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:27,259
don't have any privileged information so

1781
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,869
anything I can come up with I can say

1782
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:32,469
which is refreshing but I think that

1783
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:35,089
Roberts comment about the one web

1784
01:11:32,469 --> 01:11:37,219
network and there's like massive new

1785
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,500
space generation of satellite networks

1786
01:11:37,219 --> 01:11:40,730
is really increasing both the amount of

1787
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,650
things we have in the orbit and the

1788
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:44,030
amount me depend on them and space is

1789
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:46,790
something that the whole world shares we

1790
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:49,190
only have one earth in one orbit and so

1791
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:51,290
a debris generating attack could really

1792
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:54,110
change our ability to use space for

1793
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:56,480
generations and I think that is probably

1794
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:59,339
the most scary to me

1795
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,440
yeah I would add from my sort of space

1796
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,660
perspective as well that one thing that

1797
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,400
sometimes is forgotten in the debate is

1798
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,170
the space it's not interesting for space

1799
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,730
itself well it is it's interesting but

1800
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,560
but I mean it's because with all the

1801
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:12,900
things we do with it and we do so many

1802
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:16,980
things with space so I mean weather

1803
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:18,990
forecasting disaster forecasting it's

1804
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,330
the main way for the European Union to

1805
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:26,160
monitor use of agricultural subsidies

1806
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:29,400
for instance at space any other

1807
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:30,660
questions while you're thinking I take

1808
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,570
the opportunity because I really want to

1809
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:36,420
ask this this question myself so I was

1810
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:39,540
just wondering if to all of you if that

1811
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:42,420
you see a point where the threat level

1812
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,480
or the possibility of bad things is

1813
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:47,340
going to get to such a level that that

1814
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,740
will actually hinder development

1815
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,570
innovation because the threat is seen to

1816
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:55,139
be so big that that it actually holds

1817
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:57,860
back innovation or whether that point

1818
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:00,330
will then push for this kind of

1819
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:03,420
agreement like you mentioned we have

1820
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:05,640
with the Outer Space Treaty that what

1821
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,620
will it we will it be that we we say

1822
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,210
whether it's the private business or

1823
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,070
even the military that okay let's hold

1824
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:13,170
back it's too dangerous or will it mean

1825
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,030
that okay yes we have to sort of put

1826
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:18,570
ourselves in a frame of rules and

1827
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:20,340
regulations very speculative I am after

1828
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:24,330
an academic as well so we can ask

1829
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:27,570
anything we like and and any sorts of

1830
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:32,130
that I can tell you we see the threat

1831
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:35,009
levels rising rapidly in space

1832
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:38,420
but on the other hand we need to take

1833
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:41,760
measures to protect ourselves so we are

1834
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:43,530
increasing protection levels I think you

1835
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,320
know necessary good or bad but it is

1836
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:48,330
affect yeah we have to do that and I

1837
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,950
think it is will continue on look at

1838
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:51,950
worse in the next few years

1839
01:13:53,080 --> 01:14:00,220
I can take a guess I think that my hope

1840
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:04,120
is that there's a lot of positive

1841
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:05,380
changes in spaces and overall we're

1842
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,390
seeing a lot of commitment to using

1843
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,610
space technology and I'm very optimistic

1844
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,440
that the magical promise of those

1845
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,969
technologies will be such that we're

1846
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,530
willing to face these risks head-on

1847
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,270
instead of hide from them I think that

1848
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:18,009
cybersecurity is something we've gotten

1849
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:20,080
actually very good at engineering on the

1850
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:22,150
ground saikhan shows there's a lot of

1851
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,370
really committed research in the broader

1852
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:26,379
cybersecurity area and I think in outer

1853
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:30,460
space there's potential for that it can

1854
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:35,050
protect that innovation I guess I would

1855
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:36,820
look at it and and think right now it's

1856
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:40,750
just it's such an uneven playing field

1857
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:42,429
in space so that there's you know really

1858
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:44,830
back to what James talked about in his

1859
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:47,410
in his presentation that the for

1860
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,850
cyberspace the threshold is so low but

1861
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:51,070
for outer space the threshold was so

1862
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:52,510
high so as long as we continue to have

1863
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:55,299
that imbalance there's always going to

1864
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:57,190
be that that threat environment but that

1865
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:00,160
as the technology develops and that

1866
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:02,679
threshold outer space drops you know

1867
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,840
will we get to that point before things

1868
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,700
go terribly wrong you know I don't know

1869
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,080
but until that as long as that

1870
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:12,000
imbalances there then I think yeah

1871
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,000
there's the potential to to be worried

1872
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,620
some questions don't this wonderful

1873
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:25,540
opportunity of having these different

1874
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:28,019
experts go lost come on you must have

1875
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:38,260
some questions

1876
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:40,450
yes good morning

1877
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:42,570
yeah from the European room in all three

1878
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:47,670
years so I have a question reckons with

1879
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:51,549
these tools were provided by Airbus so

1880
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:54,730
have you the intention to certify by the

1881
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:56,110
national security agencies these tools

1882
01:15:54,730 --> 01:16:04,330
to provide their products have a

1883
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:08,440
protection yeah so you say that you are

1884
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:10,540
providing some tools to certify that you

1885
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:13,599
come you can give this protection to the

1886
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:15,580
satellites and all the systems so all

1887
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,100
these software that you like to

1888
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:21,030
implement is going to be certified by

1889
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:24,430
national security agencies

1890
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:27,070
yes absolutely what is the whole toolbox

1891
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:28,810
that needs to be employed but they're

1892
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:30,910
not only tools but it's also governance

1893
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:33,880
and processes that needs to put in place

1894
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:35,800
so in Europe for instance we have a

1895
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,250
certain process for space developments

1896
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,640
called EC SS standard and this e CSS

1897
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:46,000
Center is currently evolving and up to

1898
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,070
now there was very little cyber risk in

1899
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,860
the standard actually almost nothing and

1900
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,750
now this is changing there will be an

1901
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:56,320
evolution of this whole governance

1902
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:59,080
processes coming up but it takes some

1903
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,540
time it's governance is quite slow

1904
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:04,630
it took us also four years to implement

1905
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:06,670
appropriate governance and now we're

1906
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:08,800
still not there so when I write here

1907
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,810
full lifecycle protection yeah we are

1908
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,820
just the beginning to protect a full

1909
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:15,250
lifecycle yeah it's a pretty lengthy

1910
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:17,410
process and tools of course they're out

1911
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:19,540
there another issue we develop even more

1912
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:21,220
on tools in-house fortify off-the-shelf

1913
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:23,320
use commercially we work regularly

1914
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:26,290
together with academia to achieve that

1915
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:30,880
but to us it's pretty long and dds and

1916
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:34,480
costly process and in all this process

1917
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:37,450
for the products so we I attended

1918
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:41,169
yesterday upon and they talk about the

1919
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:44,320
ops all answers so do you have in this

1920
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:47,590
brother lifecycle the observance of the

1921
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:49,840
product they need to update and the

1922
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:54,130
running pace between operational leads

1923
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,409
and maintaining means that they need how

1924
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:58,360
to because usually when you have to

1925
01:17:56,409 --> 01:18:00,429
certify all these things and you have to

1926
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:06,009
update usually when you finish this

1927
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:06,460
cycle a new egg has come so yeah we have

1928
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,170
impleaded

1929
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,840
implemented what we call product

1930
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:13,810
security lifecycle management plan is a

1931
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,540
complete governance document including

1932
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:18,100
with the product security control plan

1933
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,409
where we implement all these controls

1934
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,060
there is no part of our we call it BMS

1935
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:25,360
business management system we have

1936
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:28,119
implemented it our our engineering and

1937
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:31,330
other teams start living to it but we go

1938
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:33,280
permanently and do reassessment and our

1939
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:35,469
job is to do a clear risk assessment

1940
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,719
stater is to the business come up with

1941
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:39,730
mitigation activities and reduce the

1942
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:42,909
risk levels and then we come back again

1943
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:45,339
a year later look again at the residual

1944
01:18:42,909 --> 01:18:47,710
risk make sure we can add additional

1945
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,869
measures and put it down to the complete

1946
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:52,540
sack cycle and these tools this PSL MP

1947
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:55,869
and the PSAP is an in-house developed

1948
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:58,239
processing tool to support that what we

1949
01:18:55,869 --> 01:19:00,299
are happy to share somebody need some

1950
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:03,280
information just contact me directly I

1951
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:05,710
would like to take the opportunity to to

1952
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,570
make any new question so it's in

1953
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:10,929
reference to the lieutenant colonel

1954
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:12,719
about the how to integrate cyber and

1955
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:15,310
space planning

1956
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,040
process inside the operational planning

1957
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:21,070
process as you said there are new

1958
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:24,790
domains now we can say that we can have

1959
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:28,599
at least two new domains we have four

1960
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:30,100
services so what is the what is the way

1961
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,770
that you think that is going to be

1962
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,570
implemented in the in the operational

1963
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:36,580
planning process so it should be used

1964
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:39,670
like a special operational forces in

1965
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:43,179
from the strategy level or you should we

1966
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:44,739
use integrated in their services how how

1967
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:46,659
do you think that is going to be used in

1968
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:49,000
my opinion it is a fully needs to be a

1969
01:19:46,659 --> 01:19:51,129
fully integrated approach also in

1970
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,080
operations it needs to be done by the

1971
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,550
key players in for instance to all the

1972
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,040
European Space Agency's

1973
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:59,110
crafts are operated by a sock is

1974
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,400
operation center in terms of Germany so

1975
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:02,619
this needs to be implemented in their

1976
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,989
day-to-day operational plans also they

1977
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:07,750
do a lot of already of that and

1978
01:20:04,989 --> 01:20:09,780
protecting that kind of activities so

1979
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:12,880
this is a hand-in-hand process between

1980
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:15,489
industry between the customer between

1981
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,889
international organizations get it

1982
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:20,049
certified if you apply specific

1983
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:22,989
equipment you have to have a certain

1984
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:25,690
certification levels talk to National

1985
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:29,169
Space Agency so we're talking to German

1986
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:32,290
DLR to Frenchness and and others so this

1987
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:34,030
is a process but this is just taking off

1988
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:36,400
you know you know this is in the

1989
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:38,949
civilian world this is just starting for

1990
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,489
the last three or four years but it's a

1991
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:41,489
long way to go

1992
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:49,110
my experience is much more in the US

1993
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:52,420
system and I'm still learning NATO but

1994
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:54,940
there's there's a separation at least in

1995
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,920
the u.s. between the services which are

1996
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:59,799
primarily an organized training equip

1997
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:01,540
function and then the organization's the

1998
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,579
combatant commands that we have that

1999
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:05,920
really do the operational level planning

2000
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:10,659
right so they they rely on the services

2001
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:15,579
to have forces provided to them so the

2002
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:17,230
service side of it I think I think

2003
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:19,299
there's a very real argument that you

2004
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:22,388
shouldn't have a military service

2005
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:23,920
without an ability to exercise some type

2006
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:26,170
of military force right some type of

2007
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,989
force application but at the same time

2008
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:31,570
we're seeing these information age

2009
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:33,579
domains or capabilities they can't get a

2010
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:35,440
seat at the table right so then there's

2011
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:38,500
it's a resourcing and funding issue

2012
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,808
that's a little separate from or not a

2013
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,190
little it is separate from within the

2014
01:21:40,809 --> 01:21:44,829
combatant commands building the

2015
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:47,409
operational plans we've seen some people

2016
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:49,329
for some time with space expertise for

2017
01:21:47,409 --> 01:21:52,540
cyber space expertise definitely

2018
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:55,000
electronic warfare in the planning teams

2019
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,300
in these in these combatant commands

2020
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,280
trying to do that I don't know that it's

2021
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:03,429
it's fully functional there's a lot of

2022
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:06,610
other competing issues we heard a couple

2023
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:08,260
days ago from the j6 right so if you're

2024
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:10,450
gonna do cyber operation

2025
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:13,360
where should that person sit should they

2026
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:15,519
sit in the six where should they sit in

2027
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,650
the three if they're doing free sure

2028
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:21,010
planning should they sit in the six or

2029
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:23,379
in the three I think there's an argument

2030
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:25,870
to say that if you're a cyberspace

2031
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:28,900
operator you should be either in the

2032
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:30,880
three or the five right doing planning

2033
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,769
as our operations and if you look across

2034
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,840
at least for the US if you look across

2035
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:36,640
the our combatant commands and then

2036
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,800
within the Air Force our major commands

2037
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:41,100
we've got a lot of different approaches

2038
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,040
out there we've blended a three six or

2039
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:47,350
three five six or we certain the Intel

2040
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,260
guys the two we have a a two three six

2041
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:52,810
right so we're no we haven't made a

2042
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:54,910
remind yet right all of the rest of the

2043
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:57,220
operators are in the three and all of

2044
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:58,870
the planners are in the five with the

2045
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,630
exception of the six guys they're over

2046
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:03,700
in the six still right and so it's hard

2047
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:06,100
to for me to make argument we're fully

2048
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:08,380
integrated when they're in different

2049
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,120
staff structures and as you travel

2050
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:12,760
around to different headquarters the

2051
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:17,500
structures themselves change slightly

2052
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:20,970
right so I guess my argument would be at

2053
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:23,470
least one unifying staff structure

2054
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:25,090
putting the people in the six into the

2055
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:27,190
three and five would be a way I don't

2056
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:29,650
know I'm sure people in the six would

2057
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:32,710
have disagreements with that but then on

2058
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:37,030
the service side can we find another way

2059
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:38,980
to get the folks who are responsible for

2060
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:41,769
these capabilities a seat at the table

2061
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,179
an equal full seat at the table when it

2062
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:44,770
comes to discussing funding and

2063
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,900
resources because this stuff is

2064
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,380
expensive right I mean this we're not

2065
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:52,690
talking about about low-cost

2066
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:54,310
capabilities I don't know that we can do

2067
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,960
that without services right so the in

2068
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:59,200
the u.s. we're looking at a separate

2069
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,750
space service we are standing up a space

2070
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,250
command for the you know across we have

2071
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:05,590
a Cyber Command but there's no talk

2072
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:07,540
about a cyber service within NATO I

2073
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:10,330
think the Germans are the only ones now

2074
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:13,870
to have a cyber service but it's a cyber

2075
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:15,220
and information service and they don't

2076
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,570
have it my understanding they don't have

2077
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,610
a true ascension thing right so there's

2078
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:20,080
nobody who who enlists or is

2079
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,880
commissioned within the German armed

2080
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,070
forces as a cyber person

2081
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,570
you're in the Army or the Navy and you

2082
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:27,820
can go do an assignment as a cyber

2083
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:29,679
person in their service but then you

2084
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:32,380
just as likely go back to your your

2085
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,300
separate service right so we haven't

2086
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:36,460
figured this out yet what's the right

2087
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,170
approach but I think there is an

2088
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:40,180
argument that these folks need to have

2089
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:43,180
that seat at the table if you're going

2090
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:44,470
to treat them as true peer capabilities

2091
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,510
and operational domains

2092
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:48,820
you can't keep funneling them through

2093
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:50,380
the traditional services because the the

2094
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,920
funding is just not there

2095
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:56,170
right as an error chief his primary

2096
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,240
responsibility is the air space and

2097
01:24:56,170 --> 01:25:00,040
cyberspace are going to naturally be

2098
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:03,849
secondary considerations and they should

2099
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:05,650
be right so you know you need to have

2100
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,060
somebody that's sitting there next to

2101
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:10,509
those folks that can make those

2102
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:12,190
arguments I think thank you for very

2103
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:13,990
good questions I just add from my point

2104
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,910
I think this really illustrates this

2105
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:17,920
importance of interdisciplinarity which

2106
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:19,360
is a term we tend to use in academia but

2107
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,060
I think should be as much more widely

2108
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,480
it's actually not possible to keep

2109
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:26,380
that's one of the consequences of

2110
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,480
development of Technology which is

2111
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:31,030
nothing to do with technology only but

2112
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,469
it is that we no longer have the borders

2113
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:34,990
between people doing one thing and

2114
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:36,640
people doing another thing so I think

2115
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:39,670
now you have aren't you a coffee break

2116
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:41,920
especially the panel unless there's any

2117
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:45,430
short quick questions you thought about

2118
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,870
then I think I can thank you the

2119
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:48,520
audience for your attention and thank

2120
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:52,110
our wonderful panel I think we give them

2121
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,110
another hand for a very interesting
