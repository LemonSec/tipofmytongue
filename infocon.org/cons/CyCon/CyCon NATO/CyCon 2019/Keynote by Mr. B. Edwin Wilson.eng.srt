1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,798
thank you and good morning it's really

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,240
an honor to be here this morning and be

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,730
able to share some thoughts and some

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,559
perspectives first I just wanted to

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,240
extend my sincere thanks to the CCDC OE

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,850
really for your leadership and vision

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,009
bringing together forums like this it's

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,230
you know like you mentioned yesterday

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,230
yeah cuz you're a small organization but

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,060
I would argue a bit of a sports buff you

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,240
hit well above your weight if you will

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,040
so well done it's a great to see the

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,350
caliber of talent you you bring together

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,320
each year and so just keep up the

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,120
tremendous work and it's a topic of such

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,920
importance to us all it's good to see

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,370
the whole team come together and be able

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,070
to share perspectives I know I speak for

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,288
the all of the conference participants

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,239
we also appreciate the hospitality of

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,280
really the whole Estonian team out here

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,349
I don't know yok you said that weather

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,059
was bad but from my perspective it's my

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,800
first visit to Estonia and we've had

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,180
three days of really good weather so I

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,819
don't you've got a long summer going on

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,150
based on your comments yesterday so well

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,799
done ordering up the good weather so I'm

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,990
pleased to really have the opportunity

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,710
to share some perspectives on

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,560
cooperating to strengthen cyber defenses

32
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:20,009
this is a topic it's important as it is

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,200
timely it's so to be sure strong cyber

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,420
defenses are relevant to all of us

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,950
because they can do and can and do

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,130
effect such things as military

37
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,369
operations economic development national

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,490
policy choices and even our very notions

39
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,380
of nations sovereignty towards this end

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,560
working together to improve national

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,449
cyber defense mechanisms will strengthen

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,060
regional stability and confidence and

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,540
enable us to counter the influence of

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,189
global competitors the United States has

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,310
long been committed to an open and

46
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,839
reliable access to information we

47
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,880
believe in the United States that every

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,240
nation's prosperity liberty and security

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,280
depend upon it the internet empowers us

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,310
and enriches our lives by providing ever

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,819
greater access to new knowledge business

52
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,250
and services in the US military

53
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,900
computers networks information

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,560
technologies all types of systems are

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,870
really

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,220
involved in the IT ICT are the

57
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,370
underpinnings of our warfighting

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,800
superiority but the world is really

59
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,140
changing and has been for some time and

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,420
it's my counterpart from Japan

61
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,299
highlighted it's accelerating the

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,738
threats are accelerating a dramatic pace

63
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,450
the arrival of the digital age has

64
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,610
created tremendous challenges for the

65
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,738
Department of Defense and the United

66
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,410
States and our partners and allies the

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,209
open transnational and decentralized

68
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,880
nature of the Internet can also create

69
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,190
significant vulnerabilities we all

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,780
depend on the cyberspace domain for

71
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,019
nearly every essential civilian

72
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,640
commercial and military function given

73
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,410
this dependence threats to our cyber

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,950
defenses have the potential to be an

75
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,660
urgent and unacceptable risk

76
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,750
unacceptable risk to any nation its

77
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,329
partners and its allies today we are

78
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,370
gauged in a long-term strategic

79
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,489
competition with aggressive revisionist

80
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,140
powers these bad actors are waging

81
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,830
persistent campaigns in and through

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,760
cyberspace

83
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,220
to achieve asymmetric advantage they

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,750
steal technology many of the nation's

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,090
represented here there's still

86
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,459
technology undermining our military

87
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,230
advantages threaten our critical

88
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,329
infrastructure disrupt our government

89
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,149
and commerce weaken our collective

90
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:36,810
prosperity and challenge our democratic

91
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,780
processes the scope the pace and the

92
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,370
sophistication of the malicious cyber

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,220
activity we're seeing around the world

94
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,660
continues to rise

95
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,630
although the consequences for any single

96
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,160
intrusion or incident may be limited in

97
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,780
the aggregate these coordinated

98
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,970
malicious cyber campaigns form a

99
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,329
strategic threat where their objective

100
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,010
is to win without waging war operating

101
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,239
below thresholds of our traditional

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,950
response mechanisms or thresholds these

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,340
activities pose a long-term strategic

104
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,290
rests to the risk to the United States

105
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,569
to our allies in to our partners our

106
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,429
fear is that in today's strategic

107
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,190
environment these state-sponsored

108
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,459
campaigns of daily online cyber activity

109
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,650
may divide and destabilize us but with

110
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,020
the challenge comes lots of opportunity

111
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,940
our vision is to chart a new course for

112
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,280
new

113
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,690
for how our respective militaries and

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,630
national governments confront these

115
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,730
threats let me describe the approach

116
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,490
we're taking in the United States to

117
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,050
confront these challenges the US has

118
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,690
recognized the long term strategic

119
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,360
competition that I described previously

120
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,410
requires a more assertive proactive

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,220
approach especially in cyberspace

122
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,780
coupled with a more comprehensive

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,750
approach to integrating cyber

124
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,059
capabilities with domestically in the

125
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,880
United States and most importantly with

126
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,580
our international partners towards this

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,730
in secretary mattis issued a new DoD

128
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,320
cyber strategy last August which was to

129
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,720
guide the development of DoD cyber

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,750
forces and strengthen our cyber defense

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
and strategic deterrence posture we

132
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,400
understand that our systems must be

133
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,549
cyber hardened resilient and secure even

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,780
in a cyber contested environment

135
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,230
ultimately our strategy is what we

136
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,820
described us to defend Ford to see and

137
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,850
understand imminent threats in

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,890
cyberspace to deter disrupt and defeat

139
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,710
cyber threats the threat in the United

140
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,930
States our international partners and

141
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,299
this is best accomplished at their

142
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,050
source before they reach the homeland

143
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,290
our homeland or our partners and allies

144
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,450
homeland our new strategy articulates

145
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,470
DoD's military objectives for cyberspace

146
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,780
in four key areas first we must ensure

147
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,230
that our networks and systems and when I

148
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,669
say systems I mean force structures such

149
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:05,150
as aircraft ships submarines land forces

150
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,520
etc or cyber hardened resilient and

151
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,010
secure against malicious cyber activity

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,260
in the end or joint force must be able

153
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,960
to execute its missions both defensive

154
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,560
and offensive in and through a cyber

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,419
contested environment second we must be

156
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,450
prepared to defend our national critical

157
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,520
infrastructure from cyber attacks just

158
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,000
as we do against threats from air land

159
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,280
sea and the in the space domains

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,870
cyberspace is not unique the DoD plays a

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,820
role and we've been working very

162
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,430
diligently to understand that role

163
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,050
alongside our domestic departments and

164
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,569
agencies such as the Department of

165
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,749
Homeland

166
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,789
purity third we must improve our ability

167
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:46,349
to secure sensitive DoD information

168
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,808
wherever it resides

169
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:51,089
whether that is DoD networks and systems

170
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,879
or the contractors that make up our

171
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:57,300
defense industrial base that information

172
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,860
really is gives us a military strategic

173
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,929
advantage in the future and that's being

174
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,020
put at risk and I'll describe that in

175
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:05,938
just a second and lastly which is really

176
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,529
the bedrock of our strategy we must

177
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,969
strengthen our partnerships around the

178
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,550
world when it comes to countering

179
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,558
emerging cyber threats we understand

180
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,479
this is a really a strategic force

181
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:18,899
multiplier so that's both with

182
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,389
international partners industry and then

183
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,860
domestically inside the country in the

184
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,959
United States as alongside of our

185
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,959
domestic partners our department and

186
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,729
agencies for generations the Western

187
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,649
world has relied on close partnerships

188
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,469
to counter the strategic threats from

189
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,819
our adversaries in this digital era we

190
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,069
are turning to this foundational

191
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,199
principle I believe secretary mattis

192
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,330
expressed it clearly as we were

193
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,849
developing the cyber strategy our DoD

194
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,659
cyber strategy when he shared a personal

195
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,878
perspective and that was in over 40

196
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:53,599
years of military service that included

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,279
a long legacy of combat experience

198
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,069
general mattis or secretary mattis at

199
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,389
the time never once fought in a US only

200
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,800
formation he emphasized that he always

201
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,659
always fought side-by-side with

202
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,559
international partners in coalition

203
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:12,599
formations so this concept is we began

204
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:15,300
to think about it really applies in

205
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,938
cyberspace it's at the heart of our DoD

206
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,919
Cyprus strategy and it's fully supported

207
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,180
by secretary Shanahan who was

208
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,459
instrumental

209
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,069
we saw him quite often as we were

210
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:29,399
developing our do to cyber strategy so

211
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:32,789
he fully endorses as we this concept as

212
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,889
we were developing the cyber strategy to

213
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,828
maximize the potential of success when

214
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,779
operating in this critical domain

215
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:42,688
the DoD cyber strategy was published in

216
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,550
2018 clearly and strongly prioritizes

217
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,490
expanding cyber cooperation with

218
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,229
partners to that end we have renewed our

219
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,120
focus over the last year to build and

220
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,040
enhance our relationships with their

221
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,250
international allies and part

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,110
as well as industry and our u.s.

223
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,639
interagency counterparts such as the

224
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,019
Department of Homeland Security and the

225
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,639
Federal Bureau of Investigation the FBI

226
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,649
just as the cyberspace domain itself

227
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,569
does not recognize territorial boundary

228
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,940
lines we understand that our efforts to

229
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:13,800
strengthen our cyber defense must extend

230
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,440
beyond the borders of the United States

231
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,829
we strongly desired a closely partner

232
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,060
with international partners and allies

233
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:24,508
building on partner nation skills

234
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,449
resources capabilities and I think most

235
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,130
value bilities perspectives we believe

236
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,029
this enhances our mutual cybersecurity

237
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,339
posture

238
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,860
both here in the region in Europe and

239
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,880
around the world

240
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,519
we are working to improve our own

241
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,060
competence in and resources for building

242
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,990
partner capacity in cyberspace

243
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,449
traditionally we've done a great job I

244
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,100
think in Detroit in the both in the

245
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,189
force structure associated with combat

246
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,470
operations kinetic forces this new

247
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,649
security cooperation is a bit new for

248
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,240
cyberspace so we're working through that

249
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,279
where necessary we seek to reinforce

250
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,649
existing information sharing mechanisms

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,620
and develop new ones we think this is

252
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,350
foundational to our success it is from a

253
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,970
foundation of robust international

254
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,620
information sharing relationships that

255
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,769
we will increase our collective cyber

256
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,600
defense posture additionally the United

257
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,839
States wants to improve how we train

258
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,720
exercise and operate alongside partners

259
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,510
in the region and on the world on a

260
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,060
globally to improve our collective cyber

261
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,370
capabilities as part of broadening our

262
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,138
coalition of close cyber partners we

263
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,060
will continue to advocate for our allies

264
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,000
and partners to secure their domestic

265
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,040
telecom networks and supply chains

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,079
similar to the direction that the

267
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,930
Japanese are have just articulated

268
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,000
previously to this talk but making

269
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,849
informed decisions today to avoid

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,910
mortgaging really their nations security

271
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,800
in the future the DoD will also continue

272
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,300
to work alongside our domestic and Ford

273
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,279
partners to promote international

274
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,060
commitments related to appropriate

275
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,610
behavior in cyberspace including the

276
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,189
peacetime norms adopted by all nations

277
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,680
in the United Nations we also seek to

278
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:10,250
develop and implement

279
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,569
confidence-building measures where CBMs

280
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,490
above all the US government advocates

281
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,310
for responsible state behavior in

282
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,290
cyberspace during peacetime so will we

283
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,270
also press our global partners to hold

284
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,670
states that are acting irresponsibly in

285
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,189
cyberspace accountable for their actions

286
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,050
and we see that as the baseline is the

287
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,760
norms of responsible state behavior in

288
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,900
cyberspace that's been articulated by

289
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,280
the United Nations consequently along

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,810
with international partners in this

291
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,870
effort we're working to enhance our

292
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,810
combined ability to attribute indict de

293
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,480
marsh sanction or when appropriate

294
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,369
impose consequences against States or

295
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,130
non-state actors that conduct malicious

296
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,330
and destabilizing behavior in cyberspace

297
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:55,170
which are outside the accepted

298
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,850
international norms of state behavior if

299
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,560
you think about deterrence structures

300
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,320
just traditional deterrence structures

301
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,000
we think they apply to some extent it's

302
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,500
a bit more challenging in cyberspace

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,840
because there's so many different actors

304
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,240
the spectrum of conflict if you will

305
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,730
both through peacetime into conflict is

306
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,210
a challenging environment but when you

307
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,610
think about deterrence by denial good

308
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,770
cybersecurity or deterrent by

309
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,690
consequences which is what we're

310
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,240
referencing here we're strategically

311
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,040
communicating all of them apply when it

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,530
comes to strategic deterrence in

313
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,000
cyberspace

314
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,010
we recognize that cyberspace is a

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,720
man-made domain and in it many ways

316
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,610
private companies are on the front lines

317
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,340
of nation-state competition in

318
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,440
cyberspace the theft of substantive

319
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,180
sensitive DoD information from our

320
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,570
defense industrial based partners is

321
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,120
something that puts our future military

322
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,960
technological advantage at risk in

323
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,290
recognition of this fact

324
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,520
DoD continues to work with industry and

325
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,650
alongside our sister departments and

326
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,689
agencies across the US government to

327
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,490
build and strengthen trusted

328
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,920
relationships with private sector

329
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,960
entities our focus is to implement

330
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,780
world-class cyber security protections

331
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,760
and to improve how we share cyber threat

332
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,620
information whether it be threats to our

333
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,390
critical infrastructure theft of

334
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,000
intellectual property or malign

335
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,270
influence designed to destabilize

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,410
domestic and international institutions

337
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,490
likewise we are also leveraging

338
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,439
commercial cyber security

339
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,690
practices in innovations in order to

340
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,450
bring them into the US government it's a

341
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,000
long-standing of policy to include the

342
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,680
Department of Defense many of the

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,990
commercial standards and approaches for

344
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,760
workforce training certifications cyber

345
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,529
security and cyber defense serve as an

346
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,649
ideal foundation for our military

347
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,080
missions domestically we've also focused

348
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,450
on how our cyber forces operate

349
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,020
alongside our interagency partners in

350
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,029
the homeland in a supporting role and

351
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,829
this is new because in the past there

352
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,850
was a bit confusion as to whether the

353
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,770
DoD wouldn't be involved in supporting

354
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,140
defense and security of our critical

355
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,610
infrastructure we've now articulated

356
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,830
that the deity does have a role in a

357
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,680
supporting mechanisms to the other

358
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,750
departments and agencies like our

359
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,670
traditional response to incidents such

360
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,950
as natural disasters terrorist attacks

361
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,360
or other physical attacks DVD is

362
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,399
collaborating with the Department of

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,190
Homeland Security and other sector leads

364
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,440
in order to secure and defend homeland

365
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,540
cyber threats homeland from cyber

366
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,540
threats including cyber attacks on

367
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,770
critical infrastructure systems

368
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,599
similarly we are issuing guidance to our

369
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,060
National Guard personnel to support the

370
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,670
use of defensive cyber capabilities for

371
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,140
State cyberspace activities we see this

372
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,750
as an effective way to better leverage

373
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,699
the unique cyber skills and knowledge of

374
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,470
our citizen soldiers in the guard to

375
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,079
increase the resiliency of networks and

376
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,570
systems at the state city and local

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,459
community levels while providing a

378
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,760
strategic reserve of cyber security

379
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:55,109
talent for the nation all leaders should

380
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
consider how they can best leverage

381
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,800
their civilian talent to help protect

382
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,459
their respective nations we think this

383
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,870
is a best practice in many ways and

384
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,750
Estonia is probably one of the the

385
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,260
leading nations in this regard in many

386
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,180
ways each of our nations works

387
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,930
diligently to defend against malicious

388
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,050
and malicious and destabilize

389
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,010
destabilizing activities in cyberspace

390
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,569
unfortunately the current reality is

391
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,270
that our defenses may not be were both

392
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,910
robust enough and are certainly not

393
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,189
sufficient sufficiently integrated with

394
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,740
or informed by international partners

395
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,320
and allies our adversaries take

396
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,750
advantage of this fact today tomorrow

397
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,400
for the foreseeable future malign cyber

398
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,820
actors are taking more aggressive and

399
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,410
more disruptive actions in cyberspace

400
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,450
clearly our national interests are under

401
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,060
attack in cyberspace and the level of

402
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,500
risk is growing at an increasing rate as

403
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,380
we passively endure these attacks

404
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,120
history is a powerful teacher one of the

405
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,340
timeless lessons is that nations are

406
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,620
stronger when they stand together United

407
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,650
collectively against common threats the

408
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,030
emerging cyber threats that we face in

409
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,819
our respective homelands are no

410
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,860
exception that is why the United States

411
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,450
believes that a more reasoned sensible

412
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,070
approach to these emerging cyber threats

413
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,340
includes strong multilateral

414
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,680
multilateral collaboration frameworks

415
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,820
among like-minded nations would be the

416
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,920
bedrock of that collaboration frameworks

417
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,990
in enable proactive risk informed

418
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,810
actions in order to secure and defend

419
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,670
our shared interest our collective

420
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,589
responses will help blunt the actions of

421
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,329
malicious actors strengthen

422
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,640
international structures of deterrence

423
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,300
and ultimately reduce the risk of

424
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,140
miscalculation by our adversaries

425
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,750
together as a group of like-minded

426
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,199
partners we have an opportunity to shape

427
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,870
our future as my Navy friends would say

428
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,980
it would require it will require us to

429
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,840
stand the watch together and look beyond

430
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,090
our own borders in order to see

431
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,660
understand and defend against cyber

432
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:05,100
threats emanating from around the world

433
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,959
to be clear the United States stands

434
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,659
ready to work alongside our partners and

435
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,820
allies to make this a reality

436
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,310
collectively with focus and hard work

437
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,230
I'm confident with that we will

438
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,530
strengthen our collective cyber defenses

439
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,540
and be able to deter disrupt and defeat

440
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,810
cyber threats before they threaten our

441
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,699
collective national interest again thank

442
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,520
you to the ccd seolhui

443
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,870
for your vision and support I look

444
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,720
forward to continuing the work ahead

445
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,820
we've got a lot of work ahead of us it's

446
