1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,670
may I have your attention to announce

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,080
the cyber commanders panel our

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,969
distinguished commanders will be

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,460
introduced and moderated by none other

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,170
than the former commander of US Cyber

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,960
Command and Director of National

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,859
Security Agency and Merle Michael Rogers

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,800
Mike Rogers yes applause will be in

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,160
order

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,570
[Applause]

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,359
I'll pose is in order because Mike

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,780
Rogers retired from the US Navy in 2018

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,880
after almost 37 years of naval service

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,950
rising to the rank of four-star Admiral

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,620
he culminated his career with a

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,750
four-year tour as the commander of cyber

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,699
of US Cyber Command and Director of

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,010
National Security Agency in this

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,930
position Admiral Rogers was in charge of

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,120
creating the DoD's newest combatant

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,739
command and running the US government's

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,989
largest intelligence organization

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,370
currently retired Admiral Rogers is

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,769
supporting companies in the private

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,108
sector serving as a member or a senior

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,300
advisor in various ports here at the

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,309
CCDC OE we are very proud to have Mike

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,789
roaches as one of our advisory board

29
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,470
members so Admiral Rogers I hereby give

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,420
you the command of the commander's panel

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,250
I have the Conn and I have the deck as

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,960
we say in the United States Navy well

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,850
thank you all for being here today and

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,460
participating think you are fellow panel

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,259
members I'll introduce the panel what we

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,600
thought we would do is each will provide

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,390
an overview of their respective nations

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,490
efforts in the cyber arena and how their

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,009
organization fits into that then we'll

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,919
have a discussion amongst the four of us

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,320
and we'll conclude then with time for

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,090
the audience to ask questions on for the

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,240
panel on any topic that you would like

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,159
so first let me introduce the panel to

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,740
my left lieutenant general Ludwig line

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,860
host who is currently head of the German

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,079
cyber and Information space command his

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,680
background expertise and electronic

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,729
warfare information technology c3 and

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,759
signals intelligence continuing down

51
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,439
Brigadier General Maria biank a signal

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,290
officer in the United States Army

53
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,370
currently the j6 at US European Command

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,980
in Stuttgart in Germany prior to this

55
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,319
current tour was the j-3 or the

56
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,679
Director of Operations for u.s. army

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,399
cyber and lastly at the end Brigadier

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,700
General Francisco vestido who a tornado

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,860
pilot who currently is the commander of

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,410
the Joint Command for cyber operations

61
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,819
and prior to his current tour was

62
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,160
leading the center for defense

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,390
innovation so to my three panel members

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,519
thank you very much for your willingness

65
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,920
and if I could we'll just start down the

66
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,810
line we'll let you start it off thank

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,578
you very much Mike inviting me to this

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,069
distinguished panel and it's always a

69
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,750
pleasure to be back here in in Tallinn I

70
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,670
would like to start with a quote wet

71
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,700
also was mentioned by adenoids and

72
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,069
already by NATO former Warsaw summit

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,290
communique in 2016 we recognize

74
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,879
cyberspace as a domain of operations in

75
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,950
which NATO must defend itself as

76
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,129
effectively as it does in the air on

77
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,010
land and at sea and which brings us

78
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,870
immediately to a new dimension and what

79
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,280
distinguishes the military dimension of

80
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,220
saipan information space from

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,930
traditional operational domains despite

82
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,750
the complexity that connect you can

83
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,430
argue for all domains there's one thing

84
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,680
which you have to mention in the

85
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,470
beginning its authority is complemented

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,810
by virtual reality and cyber information

87
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,730
space cannot be divided into combat

88
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,430
sectors with clear spatial boundaries

89
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,869
with a significant difference the same

90
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,340
is true for maneuvering of troops or

91
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,880
counting troops and divisions this is

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,919
not the same in the dimension of cyber

93
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,168
and also but you must not be let

94
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,720
yourselves be fooled by the term virtual

95
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,120
in cyber information space two physical

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,799
effects can be achieved however the

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,139
place where cyber information

98
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,970
domain operations create an effect can

99
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,470
freely be tens of thousands of

100
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,310
kilometers away from where we actually

101
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,660
was initiated that's also a difference

102
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,940
time to has a different meaning in cyber

103
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,290
information space for example an effect

104
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,290
can be achieved over any distance

105
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:11,429
without delay so effects are achieved in

106
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,250
real time so all of these things and the

107
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,930
growing digitalization has resulted in

108
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,849
the join bonus were to establish a new

109
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,459
service as a consequence out of these

110
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,740
developments this service is called

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,880
cyber information domain service and it

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,870
was inaugurated in April 2017 what we

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,570
have done in a nutshell

114
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,850
we have centralized the core of a J 2

115
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,070
and J 6 capabilities of a Bundeswehr

116
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,389
with a jeffrey flavor to put it in a

117
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,880
very short words this six German armed

118
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,919
forces service comprises roughly about

119
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,590
fourteen thousand soldiers and civilian

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,760
employees so by doing this we took a

121
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,919
reaction on the importance of this new

122
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,090
dimension domain but we are also

123
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,539
contributing to a national security

124
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,429
provision with it we have by intention

125
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,020
no I made this service a little bit

126
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,880
broader from content when the NATO

127
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,570
definition because we have also included

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,979
the information space so that it's an

129
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,599
important effect not just dealing with

130
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,909
the technical aspects of cyber but also

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,860
what is done within which techniques the

132
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,360
information but it's perceived in

133
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,180
different ways and it's also an

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,669
important factor we have established

135
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,729
already our own situation center for the

136
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:26,609
cyber information two domains space

137
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,349
space domain a valid situation picture

138
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,210
providing the basis for options for

139
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,789
action and Zuno G's is generated

140
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,469
generated by merging situation reports

141
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:37,710
from all areas that may be relevant for

142
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,590
the cyber information domain so with

143
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,349
this situational picture we can actively

144
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,929
support the idea of future joint force

145
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,550
in which a joint operational commander

146
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,830
is enabled to achieve the side effects

147
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,180
throughout all domains be it see land

148
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,310
air space and cyber information domain

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,229
so there may be future consequences

150
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,820
which may result in an establishment for

151
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,710
example on cyber information two main

152
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,130
component commands or something like

153
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,349
this likely haven't we have our domains

154
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:10,260
in addition to risk clearly military

155
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:12,599
aspects we are looking on close national

156
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,250
international cooperation because I

157
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,659
strongly believe that cyberspace plays

158
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,610
in Ossining role in today's

159
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,250
understanding of national NATO's over

160
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,410
deterrence and defense posture we have a

161
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,229
military capabilities for national cyber

162
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,900
operations available and Germany is

163
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,789
spending on a national political and

164
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,739
legal mandate in general willing to

165
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:35,880
contribute to nato-led operations also

166
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,950
with regard to the cyber domain nato as

167
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,440
well as NATO member states have to be

168
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,729
completely aware of where cyberspace to

169
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,499
understand minute by minute

170
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,169
state of our network so that commanders

171
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:48,419
can rely on them we have to deepen our

172
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,698
close bilateral cooperation as well as

173
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,089
our cooperation at European Union and

174
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,409
NATO levels close dialogue is essential

175
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,669
at the international level since the

176
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,839
Simon information space is not a

177
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:02,339
respecter of national boundaries but we

178
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,740
have also a national cooperation and

179
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,749
from German perspective this is based on

180
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,189
the German federal federal government's

181
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:12,870
cybersecurity strategy which was

182
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:14,399
published in 2016 already in 2011 we

183
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,580
established under the lead of a Minister

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,129
of Interior national cyber defence

185
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,719
centre since then it served as a forum

186
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,520
for cooperation between the various

187
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,770
sectors government bodies in the

188
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,899
sovereign information domain the center

189
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,580
is currently being developed into an

190
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,259
inter-ministerial operational

191
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,139
institution involving all key

192
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,999
stakeholders a crucial important step to

193
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,319
ensure Germany's future capacity to act

194
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,909
in this field our national cyber

195
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,439
information domain service is already

196
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:45,479
closely connected with all key

197
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,249
authorities and government agencies we

198
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,289
have also entered into our first

199
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,209
partnerships with academic and business

200
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,680
institutions for example with Internet

201
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,289
service providers with German telecom

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,169
but also with research institutes for

203
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:59,998
example Fraunhofer Institute in summary

204
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,310
only together nationally internationally

205
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,620
can we guarantee resistance to threats

206
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,180
from the cyber information space which

207
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,709
is an essential requirement for future

208
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,709
development and welfare of modern

209
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,539
societies and my service will make a

210
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,610
significant contribution to achieve this

211
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,479
important task thank you very much thank

212
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,479
you Ludwig Maria

213
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:27,840
good morning Maria biank from United

214
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,400
States European Command and it's been an

215
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,069
honor to be asked to be here

216
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,250
I certainly appreciate it my first visit

217
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,630
to Tallinn and Estonia so it's been been

218
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,429
wonderful and I certainly appreciate the

219
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,130
hospitality

220
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,370
so Admiral Rogers mentioned just one of

221
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:49,080
my three jobs so my first job really is

222
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:51,690
a very traditional j6 job and you know

223
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:56,360
that deals with what I would call you

224
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,620
know operations and plans communications

225
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,240
satellite communications terrestrial

226
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,950
communications we focus on

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,250
interoperability we work very closely

228
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,450
with NATO and obviously we do quite a

229
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,940
bit with exercises I have a second job

230
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,430
that's you know it takes not much of my

231
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,520
time but a little bit it's the chief

232
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:20,189
information officer for the theatres the

233
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,100
European theater and that is really the

234
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,010
governance and policy there's different

235
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,560
laws and regulations of what we can put

236
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,890
on our networks in and it's just part of

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,760
our part of our layered defense

238
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:38,040
mechanism I spend most of my time on the

239
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,920
3rd job which is the commander of the

240
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,120
joint cyber center and the joint cyber

241
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,000
center plans coordinates synchronizes

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,430
and integrates cyberspace operations

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,490
throughout the European theater this is

244
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,510
a this is a significant lift I have a

245
00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,720
great team of folks that that assist

246
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,750
with this and what's I think a little

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,230
unusual for European Command as a

248
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,339
combatant command is that this

249
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,640
organization the joint cyber center

250
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:14,100
actually works directly for our Director

251
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,500
of Operations at European Command so the

252
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:24,210
j-3 I have a the the position of j6 has

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:28,140
an additional duty as the deputy j-3 for

254
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:31,200
cyber and that we use the the joint

255
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,750
cyber center as a mechanism to do that

256
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,200
that takes up a little over half of

257
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,020
of our time when when dealing with the

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,150
many threats and vulnerabilities and and

259
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,660
that sort of thing our goal with the

260
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:50,360
joint cyber center is to normalize cyber

261
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:54,030
operations and what I mean by that is to

262
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:59,640
treat cyber like we treat any other

263
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:02,640
domain air land sea we use the processes

264
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,330
that we already have in place at the

265
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,569
command at the headquarters and we we

266
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:13,200
have we use we use those processes for

267
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,020
cyber we don't develop new processes and

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
that at times you know that's a that

269
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,150
that that has been maturing over the

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,140
last few years I'd say we're probably

271
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:27,360
we're well into that we exercise like

272
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,500
that but most importantly we work day to

273
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,310
day as an integrated element out of the

274
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,990
j-3 shop and what I mean by that is that

275
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,329
you know so there's a targeting process

276
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,030
like any other domain well cyber is part

277
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,370
of that targeting process there is a

278
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,740
process for you know staffing certain

279
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,410
things making decisions there's a whole

280
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,390
process there's a whole battle rhythm

281
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,199
process battle rhythm events that we

282
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,750
have integrated cyber so cyber isn't you

283
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,480
know isn't the trailer on you know

284
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,910
hooked to a car or something like that

285
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,390
cyber is is completely completely

286
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,969
integrated and that allows us to provide

287
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,280
a common operating picture as best we

288
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,860
can there's much growth to be done there

289
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,910
in terms of a cyber common operating

290
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,740
picture it allows us to assess risk in

291
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,060
terms of what commanders would

292
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:27,839
understand it allows us to assess and

293
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:31,199
develop mitigating strategies to to

294
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,170
mitigate those risks and and we do that

295
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,960
best by emphasizing quite frankly

296
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,810
collaboration and coalition building we

297
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,920
share a lot of our information we work

298
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:47,760
very hard to do that we have a cyber

299
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,209
information sharing cell

300
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,959
sell quite frankly we've had a lot of

301
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:57,859
luck getting things important

302
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,709
information down to the lowest possible

303
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,920
common denominator classification wise

304
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:08,579
and we have a great partnership with

305
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,769
with NATO allies and other partner

306
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,349
nations to do that we also have a cyber

307
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:17,459
analytics team that shares at the

308
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:20,339
unclassified level using threat connect

309
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:24,060
and slack and that is a that that team

310
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,769
has had great success also in in sharing

311
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,329
the information and you know the purpose

312
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:30,329
of sharing that information is to

313
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:32,729
provide common situational awareness as

314
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:35,638
well as a common understanding of

315
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,769
network defence and so we've had a much

316
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,300
luck in that we're the only combatant

317
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,910
command to do something like that

318
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,069
so this cyber information exchange cell

319
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,810
as well as well as the cyber analytics

320
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:50,930
team and so we we we we realize that the

321
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,719
the best defence is a collaborative

322
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:57,689
defence it's a common defense a common

323
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,300
posture that we all understand the

324
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,639
adversary the threats against our

325
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,819
different networks are different

326
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,579
nation-states and so we we understand

327
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:11,699
that that value and it's a quite frankly

328
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,399
it's a full-time job and we've got a

329
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:18,469
good team at a US European Command to do

330
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,470
that Francesco

331
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:29,490
[Applause]

332
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,410
thank you for the opportunity the CCD

333
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,449
Center of Excellence has given Italy the

334
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,149
minister of defense to represent and

335
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:40,209
they bring the regards of the chod the

336
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,870
general naturally with my authority in

337
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:46,420
direct line of command through the

338
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,249
Minister of Defense and we are here

339
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,170
because Italy is one of the supporting

340
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:52,689
nation thanks a lot to the director of

341
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,089
the center the great support you gave to

342
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,309
the cyber community I'll bring in my

343
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,370
experience in the next 8 and 10 minutes

344
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,829
on what I do what my role is three years

345
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:06,519
ago I was given the task to build a

346
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:10,300
Cyber Command by scratch my attitude was

347
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,040
I know I have to build the cake which I

348
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,258
don't know what the cake is going to

349
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,379
look like I have some ingredients three

350
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,809
years later now I realize I know which

351
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,100
cake I need to make still don't have all

352
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:25,899
the ingredients so it's quite

353
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,620
interesting and there was a chef in meat

354
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:33,129
and they said build cakes and so my real

355
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,250
duty here is my background is a tornado

356
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,740
pilot I'll bring some considerations on

357
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,709
commander control role of industry

358
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,480
recruit me the use of range and legal

359
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:47,529
studies these were all doing the next

360
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,870
seven eight minutes believe it or not I

361
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,899
have three thousand plus hours on the

362
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,730
tornado air-to-ground role the very

363
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,589
first one live in the formation there

364
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,809
and when they gave me this task I came

365
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:05,589
in an environment and what I'll bring in

366
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:08,670
today is the perspective of being having

367
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:11,319
an operational background and insider

368
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,420
3,000 plus hours on tornado zero

369
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,599
knowledge on networks clouds and all the

370
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,649
things you say which brings the first

371
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,620
consideration cyber operations is really

372
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:27,850
an operational art using the principle

373
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:31,059
principle of Wars two wars to design

374
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:34,209
your campaign one day you can go law

375
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:37,000
the next day hi in the dark daylight in

376
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:39,880
the clouds and you need to think

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,550
nicholae like your enemy is thinking of

378
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,820
you this is the perspective I bring in

379
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:48,430
in my zero knowledge of CAS with all the

380
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,650
respect with technicians and after all

381
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,339
it's a teamwork and you need to bring

382
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:56,470
together all these perspective why

383
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,530
because as a bomber I had the task an

384
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,710
effect to produce standing 10 hours to

385
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,760
understand how to penetrate the lines

386
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,490
get there alive

387
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,310
produce some effects come back through

388
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,609
the same line of defense people were

389
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,819
even more mad than few hours before in

390
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,069
that case lend measure the effects plan

391
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:23,560
again and do something else this is just

392
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,869
a cyber operation and my command in

393
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,050
Italy takes care of the military domain

394
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:31,989
the information and the network in Italy

395
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,899
and wherever we have military operations

396
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,980
if the nation calls upon I'll be ready

397
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,230
with my command

398
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,280
to participate to the support of the

399
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,420
defense of the nation

400
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,149
that's why without going into details in

401
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,820
Italy the cyber domain is an

402
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,560
intelligence driven organization the

403
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,370
services are in charge

404
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm the brown part on the right hand

405
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,560
side of the screen I do look at the

406
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,050
military domain and I give all the

407
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,379
support taken on the left hand side

408
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,360
there are people with certs

409
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,940
incidence response team taking care of

410
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,580
the public administration and the

411
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,160
private companies we all fuse all this

412
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,189
information in a single point of fusion

413
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,560
which is the das department for

414
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,350
intelligence and they refer to the Prime

415
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,200
Minister also there's a connection

416
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,389
between me and in the military

417
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,600
intelligence and the national

418
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:35,230
intelligence so I only take care of this

419
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,659
and my only duty is cyber defence this

420
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,860
is written in the books I'll be ready to

421
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,450
do operations in the theatre with an

422
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,719
appropriate legal framework which is

423
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,360
probably the most complicated activity

424
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm facing in the past three years which

425
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,040
is there

426
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,620
rules and laws to obey to tumbly man one

427
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,930
in six hundred pages pretty much says

428
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,989
keep in mind you are the civil law a

429
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:05,800
common law shared the principles in it

430
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,770
but come out with a national concept or

431
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,350
now to do legally cyber operation and I

432
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,480
am very grateful to the expertise we

433
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,480
have been Talon and we are doing the

434
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,370
same in my nation and it's easy I only

435
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,390
have to take care of command and control

436
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:25,540
and ever deployable cell they be able to

437
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,600
go somewhere in the theater and fix

438
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:33,520
things the gig guys with the a mix of

439
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:36,610
intelligence expert operational guys the

440
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,879
physical world has changed I was able to

441
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:44,320
recognize ships tanks in few seconds

442
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:47,950
from 20 miles away what I need to scope

443
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,220
now my attention on is there's a digital

444
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:55,420
domain under every single platform and

445
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,100
this is the focus of my team it's not

446
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,930
just a matter of IT

447
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:05,669
it's the OT behind be behind the things

448
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:09,400
they make and produce cyber effect in

449
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:12,160
theater that's why the domain scope of

450
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,220
the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry

451
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,500
of Defense has declared this is

452
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,250
resilience and values wire resilience

453
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,750
because we need to have platforms

454
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:29,530
equipment tools to work efficiently and

455
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,720
how do we make this work efficiently we

456
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:36,460
need to understand that resilience is a

457
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,910
matter of how we do things at night in

458
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,370
the air domain we could send radium 5 a

459
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,830
couple of jets to respond to the threats

460
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,770
now it's a matter of milliseconds and

461
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,429
that's why we need to produce a card of

462
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:54,070
young experts who have to operate in

463
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,070
this domain recruitment is the most

464
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,139
important things we have touched this

465
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,840
recently I think we need to intercept

466
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,100
those high school guys who are about to

467
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,919
approach the professional attitude

468
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,399
and the university we cannot wait for a

469
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,950
full cycle of universities to pick up

470
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,100
just two or three guys we need to

471
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,770
intercept this digital generation which

472
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,750
is there and the last recruitment I've

473
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:26,180
made was picking up 17 18 years old guys

474
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,640
dual use means how to communicate

475
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,470
command the control yes it's too easy

476
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,740
for me to take care of the military

477
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,410
domain in my command but I need to keep

478
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,980
in mind that there's a national other

479
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:43,190
side picture that looks at the cyber

480
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,520
domain so soon in a matter of seconds we

481
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:49,400
need to transit the operational picture

482
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,310
which used to be the one of land air

483
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,250
maritime now there's a cyber picture we

484
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:58,159
need to transfer to Everest the chief in

485
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,890
command of that operation that night why

486
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,980
because with my operational background I

487
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,830
kind of understood with my people that

488
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,070
there's a hybrid side of the cyber

489
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:13,929
warfare which of course we talk every

490
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:16,790
day but which is capitalizing on

491
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,820
psychological warfare everything let's

492
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,620
say crime espionage and terrorism and

493
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:26,149
probably someone doesn't have any

494
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:28,610
interest in going to cyber warfare and

495
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,250
so we need to get together with the

496
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,889
civil society and transmit what I would

497
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,530
call the tactical altitude attitude of

498
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,990
the military camouflaged people in

499
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,080
defending networks and the nation and

500
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,570
the domain we are protecting how do we

501
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,010
do this the same as I was trained on a

502
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,409
tornado let's discuss a range are

503
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:55,070
popping up here and there we abuse the

504
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:59,030
range for the locked shield we have our

505
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:01,850
own range in Italy called univox done by

506
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,910
the great company Leonardo with a bunch

507
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,709
of universities we have some

508
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,620
representatives here all I want to point

509
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:14,210
out is range is not just a matter of IT

510
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,129
we need to teach our guys 24 hour 7 how

511
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,900
to protect the military domain that's

512
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,270
why we need to discuss the

513
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,290
military operational technology which is

514
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:26,300
we need to have a multiple stakeholders

515
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:29,600
multiple end users a thorough system

516
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,810
cyber range which is able to train on

517
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,310
the military platforms avionics naval

518
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,620
satellites and so on

519
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:40,370
academia the young guys were going to

520
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:44,479
become the cyber operators and small big

521
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,550
industries were the the real tissue of

522
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,250
the nations and that's why we are

523
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,840
conference concentrating on this on the

524
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,660
experience of what shield we are

525
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,870
preparing our multi-stakeholders

526
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,150
exercise in Italy and we use this range

527
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,250
as well I'm closing down with this

528
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,620
instance with that with all the respect

529
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,690
for the scientists who came up with this

530
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,929
is if you want to protect your

531
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,600
environment energy and so on you have to

532
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,040
make your own situ and so we are being

533
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,760
in here today we're going to discuss

534
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,020
this with University of Geneva and

535
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,300
modern and regime Illya are the two

536
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:26,360
University doing cyber science and

537
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,210
masters for us I think we need to bring

538
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,419
our tactical intuition the military one

539
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:35,210
in exercising the experiments that

540
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,640
protect our networks we need to know

541
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,460
exactly right now what is running in our

542
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:46,010
networks so we think the same way the

543
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:48,350
enemy under sorry is what I bring in

544
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,500
side the range we need to give the guys

545
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,740
the operators a system which is even

546
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,850
open a night to practice to practice the

547
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:02,150
less likely scenario the most dangerous

548
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:04,459
scenario also procurement we need to

549
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,130
produce cyber operators for industry

550
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,580
because I've flown a jet for 40 years

551
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:14,720
the tornado has gone through six seven

552
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,840
lifts an update I think we need to have

553
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,140
teams work pretty much from three five

554
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,120
years time span in procurement so that

555
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,280
when a team is building the new

556
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,790
capability another team is going to

557
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,440
think in the next 10 years also

558
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,908
electronic force protection we are

559
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,309
concentrating on

560
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:38,269
because there's an environment which is

561
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:41,599
really hybrid is the mix of networks and

562
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:44,409
electronic warfare we are we have a very

563
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,178
tight connection with Special Forces

564
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:50,209
psyops and so on and in fobs

565
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,919
close down resilience dual use if you

566
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,529
should look at the same picture in the

567
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,109
nation then no matter what everyone is

568
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,539
looking at the same situation I think

569
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:02,089
this is pretty much it by the end of

570
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:05,029
this year my command will let the full

571
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:13,729
operational capability thanks a lot

572
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:15,889
thank you very so you have each laid out

573
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:18,709
a structure and approach if you will to

574
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:20,389
the military execution of cyber slightly

575
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:22,699
different one has gone on the service

576
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:25,189
route - I would argue have kind of gone

577
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:26,809
with traditional joint kind of structure

578
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,879
I'm gonna give you a minute to think I'm

579
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:30,678
gonna ask you about assessing where you

580
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:33,259
think you are when I was a commander

581
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,089
what I used to tell my bosses that our

582
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,579
chief of Defense the secretary and our

583
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:39,440
political leadership was I thought there

584
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:41,569
were four keys to our ability to execute

585
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,949
military operations in cyber so number

586
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:45,319
one we have to develop the technical

587
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:47,149
means to actually execute defense in

588
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:50,209
offense number two we have to generate

589
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:52,609
the capacity in the form of a trained

590
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,649
work force that's dedicated to apply

591
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,369
these capabilities to maximum

592
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:57,289
effectiveness

593
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:59,678
number three we need to make sure that

594
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,759
we've got the operational processes and

595
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,799
structures in place with a well-defined

596
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,959
command and control structure that both

597
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,879
the cyber side as well as the broader

598
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:10,429
operational construct that cyber is a

599
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:12,259
part of all understand and then lastly

600
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,539
we need to make sure we have clearly

601
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:17,839
articulated legal and policy frameworks

602
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:20,869
that actually allow us to execute our

603
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,908
cyber activities within a legal policy

604
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:25,189
framework that everyone understands it

605
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,749
is accepted so if you look at those kind

606
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,429
of criteria do you have the technical

607
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:30,979
capabilities do you have the people with

608
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,419
their enough and the right training do

609
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:34,519
you have the kind of operational

610
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:36,469
processes and well-defined command and

611
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,809
control and do you have the legal and

612
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:41,989
policy authorities you think you need if

613
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,789
you use those criteria how would you

614
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,290
kind of grade where you are right now in

615
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:47,620
your jury

616
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:49,690
Ludwig I'll ask you first now let me let

617
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,439
me first start with the main fault when

618
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,930
you're looking at the major

619
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,520
organizations for every domain the

620
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,920
classical domains you have established a

621
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,780
service so we have now a new domain that

622
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,030
was rationale to establish was this new

623
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,230
domain also a service not just that they

624
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,270
have a service but you have

625
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,770
preconditions to do with things that you

626
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,230
are only authorized if you're at a

627
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:10,180
service level but starts with getting

628
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,340
the right people to train and educate

629
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,410
the people this is an our system

630
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,959
depending on a service level to have a

631
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,030
significant influence also to

632
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,400
development of capabilities so since we

633
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,290
are a relatively young organization two

634
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,560
years now in stage I think we are on a

635
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,230
very good path we are not at the target

636
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,000
at the moment but I don't think we will

637
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,000
ever be so it's really a constant

638
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,220
process but with the organization set up

639
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,520
we have brought the preconditions for

640
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,230
the things that we can do as a military

641
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,360
concerning more of a legal side and I

642
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,730
think there are still a lot of debates

643
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,929
and a lot of nations which brings me to

644
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:52,150
with scenarios because looking in future

645
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,620
scenarios we had previously classical

646
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,290
military sonars you have at a certain

647
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,810
point time a declaration of war or

648
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,920
whatever we have now to face with

649
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,750
scenarios where we have probably

650
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,840
conflicts but are below the threshold of

651
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,410
a formal declared war on low tension and

652
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,870
there you have different questions now

653
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:13,210
what means by what organization can be

654
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,919
used in this type of conflicts and I

655
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,570
think there's the discussion to be

656
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,150
needed on a national basis but also

657
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,840
internationally places how to deal with

658
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,550
these things

659
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,820
who can execute certain things what are

660
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,290
the what is the legal basis for this so

661
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,570
we ciphered scenarios I think it's a

662
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,370
it's an area where organisations still

663
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,740
have need a discussion internally

664
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,969
depending on the legal set of I am Maria

665
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,180
where would you say you are in your

666
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,600
journey sir so I think from a technical

667
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:44,710
means and a generating capacity

668
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:48,840
perspective we have the the the US has

669
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:53,500
invested quite a bit in those two areas

670
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:56,020
and you know we we train our cyber

671
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,029
mission forces are trained to a joint

672
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,469
standard that standard is

673
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:03,429
is determined by US Cyber Command as you

674
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:10,869
well know sir

675
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:12,940
we are an inspired idea and so we you

676
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:16,899
know we I think that really makes us

677
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,820
very very unique so a commander gets you

678
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:21,129
know an Air Force commander gets an army

679
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,080
team on their on the on an Air Force

680
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:25,269
Network that's it's the same standard so

681
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,949
that that's that's that's a big part of

682
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,809
it our challenge quite frankly on the

683
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,629
technical and generating capacity side

684
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:33,519
is there is fierce competition for this

685
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:39,428
talent that's probably our biggest

686
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:43,809
challenge how do you recruit and as you

687
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:46,139
train and then retain the talent is is

688
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:49,029
significant and each of the services

689
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:52,449
department offense or have several

690
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:54,759
programs in place to get after that from

691
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,089
the the perspective of the operational

692
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:02,349
processes I think we're in a in a better

693
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:05,408
place than we were when when I worked at

694
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:07,119
jhq Joint Forces headquarters

695
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,789
doden a few years ago as we were

696
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,369
standing that opera organization up as a

697
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:15,330
as the defensive mechanism if you will

698
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:19,119
for defending Department of Defense

699
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:21,399
networks and so we're in a lot better

700
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:25,149
place with that I would offer that will

701
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:28,928
always have to grow that will always

702
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:33,119
mature and especially as your fourth

703
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:36,039
point as Sir was the the legal the legal

704
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:41,709
side of this the policy framework piece

705
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:44,429
I think I think the US has made great

706
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,950
strides there's great momentum right now

707
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:51,159
when it comes to the full spectrum of

708
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,379
cyberspace operations we are seeing it

709
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,570
in our national defense strategy we're

710
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:58,149
seeing in our national military strategy

711
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:02,009
we're seeing it in our national security

712
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:05,408
strategy very input this is overarching

713
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:09,179
cyber operation guidance these are

714
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:11,800
national level strategies these are not

715
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,200
just focused on cyber

716
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,820
now we also have cyber strategy the

717
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,920
department defense as a cyber strategy

718
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,100
there's a national cyber strategy that

719
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,590
further delineates and gets more into

720
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,540
the nuts and bolts of of certain things

721
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,530
so I think we've made really great

722
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:33,610
strides you know in that we've worked

723
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:36,960
the the US has worked very hard in terms

724
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,949
of a whole-of-government perspective and

725
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,490
and specifically for the for the DoD

726
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,980
getting additional authorities in place

727
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:50,770
so that we can be timely and relevant in

728
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,470
the cyberspace operation so I will offer

729
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:56,139
that just like general line who had said

730
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,760
it's a constant it's it is something

731
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,030
that is a constant process these things

732
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,220
and so as something changes there's some

733
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:06,250
there there's there's a refinement and

734
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,260
adjustment to to these four areas but

735
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,070
you know I I mean I'll offer a grade

736
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,810
just just because so I I think we're you

737
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,790
know I think we're probably at a at a

738
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,830
b-plus and I think we're doing well

739
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:22,540
great Francesco

740
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:25,330
yes thanks a lot for this question from

741
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,770
a philosophic Socratic point of view

742
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,350
this is an environment where I've

743
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,540
realized that the more you know the more

744
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:36,129
you realize you don't know everything

745
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:38,460
and with this paradox I think that the

746
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,410
major point I need to face every day is

747
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,180
convince the leadership the decision

748
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,540
maker that you are doing something good

749
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,820
and you have to make them understand the

750
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,970
decision they have to make so as the

751
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:55,360
president well laid out few minutes ago

752
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:58,000
we need to establish clearly a flow of

753
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,570
decision making activities which goes

754
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,330
from United Nations international law is

755
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,360
it an act of war or not and tell our

756
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,399
leadership that we need to act or react

757
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,799
and this is the first thing we are

758
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,199
trying to face this year so I'm working

759
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,399
with my legal team likely as a

760
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:21,250
representative here in CCD Co Center of

761
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:25,460
Excellence and try to get together and

762
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:29,520
there be another Italian lawyer

763
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,679
expert in legal activities and what we

764
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,409
need to try to understand is we need to

765
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,529
have a clear define see to command and

766
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:39,420
control legal background with the legal

767
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,660
background that tells the decision-maker

768
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:46,500
act now what we are trying to do also is

769
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:49,830
when I said at first I had ingredients

770
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:53,219
all I had was very expert technical guys

771
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,389
very Loring's coming from the every

772
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,620
single service

773
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:02,160
nowaday what am missing is guys who are

774
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:05,009
very expert but that the an operational

775
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,620
overview on things how to conduct

776
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:11,160
military operations that's why we need

777
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:14,190
to have the J two three five six series

778
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,560
with a bit of one and seven able to

779
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:21,660
design in shaping how we act our

780
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,360
professional education in order to

781
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,549
conduct military operation and how I'm

782
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,670
trying to do this trying to get together

783
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:33,360
with the operational tactical level say

784
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:36,030
ops special ops every single air land

785
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,960
maritime domain so that we produce

786
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:44,820
effects which are explainable to our

787
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:47,370
military leadership and I think we are

788
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,890
pretty much at a good stage and this is

789
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,440
the most demanding part producing a

790
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,109
legal framework and an operation of

791
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,510
design of the military operation very

792
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,550
good so we've talked about the different

793
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,710
structures or approaches you have each

794
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,080
taken we've talked about so where do you

795
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,540
feel you are in your journey you know

796
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,400
clearly the military piece is just one

797
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,110
part of a much broader component for

798
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,140
governments and so my next question

799
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,020
really is so how does the work that you

800
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,850
were doing from a military perspective

801
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,860
fit into the broader national effort

802
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,470
that each of your respective nations is

803
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,210
attempting to execute in cyber Francesco

804
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,310
I'm gonna ask you to take this one first

805
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:32,180
you didn't give me time to think

806
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,180
you're a tornado guy

807
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:48,580
and luckily I'm a tornado guys already

808
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:53,230
of the answer so I was thinking to

809
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,240
connect luckily in my nation I have a

810
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:58,330
good framework with the national

811
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,399
strategy or now to do things and take

812
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:03,100
care of the legal background which

813
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,450
supports cyber operation the main

814
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:10,600
framework is designed on democracy and

815
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:13,450
transparency and rule of law and um a

816
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:17,049
part of it the great consideration to

817
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:19,200
bring in is to build trust between the

818
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,850
military war that in civilian words

819
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,109
educate the people let the people of the

820
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:28,330
nation the old millions people

821
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:32,290
understand that the cyber is a real

822
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:35,350
threat that finally someone has got the

823
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,380
tool to reach directly the center of

824
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,660
gravity that Clausewitz said with the

825
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,600
instrument that sunsuit thousand of

826
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,970
years ago said don't even come to a war

827
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,220
just control the enemy and so we need

828
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:51,040
people understand that someone is

829
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,649
probably in the networks is doing some

830
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,930
harm already and we'll see defects

831
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,960
probably in a matter of year so I think

832
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:02,279
it's a matter of communicating trust in

833
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,260
the nation everyone staying in its

834
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,350
institutional role

835
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:11,260
Maria saying we're so I think

836
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:13,690
whole-of-government is a is a key piece

837
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:17,970
of this Admiral wheeler mentioned in his

838
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:23,110
keynote speech about the defense of the

839
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:25,209
the u.s. midterm November 2018 elections

840
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,350
and I think that was a you know we did

841
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,390
quite a bit there and there was a

842
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,930
whole-of-government we learned in in in

843
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:35,620
the Department of Defense and that type

844
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:38,290
of thing is that we're we're in a

845
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,759
supporting role so we support the

846
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,070
Department of Homeland Security we

847
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,960
support the Department of Justice and

848
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,720
the Federal Bureau of Investigation so

849
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,730
that that

850
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,990
that is a supporting role that's clearly

851
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:53,720
defined and so I think that's kind of

852
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,330
how I would see it we also though it in

853
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,660
the department offense we still interact

854
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:03,410
with other interagency partners across

855
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:07,160
our government and I think you know the

856
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:10,279
the the fact that we have published

857
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,149
strategies at the national and

858
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,300
Department of Defense level we get very

859
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:20,930
clear policy guidance in terms of

860
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:24,650
cyberspace operations our legislative

861
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:27,500
our mark our Congress has also passed

862
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:29,810
certain authorities as part of our

863
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,470
National Defense Authorization Act for

864
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:36,910
2019 and that ensures that all of us it

865
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:40,430
is set and especially US Cyber Command

866
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:44,330
can't quite frankly operate at the speed

867
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:49,160
of cyber to be timely and to be to be

868
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:51,200
relevant and so so when it comes to you

869
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,930
know the cyberspace operations at a

870
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,730
national level it is a very

871
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:59,020
collaborative whole-of-government

872
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,250
approach and it takes a lot of work

873
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,890
because sometimes that's not always

874
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,370
clear and it takes a lot of a lot of

875
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,930
teaming it's very much a team sport

876
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,670
moving I think what Maria mentioned the

877
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,230
role of government approach is vital in

878
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,060
that domain but it's also a difference

879
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,820
of this domain to be about classical

880
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,490
military domains I think and this is

881
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,560
reflected in Germany in the government's

882
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,240
cyber security strategy lettuce has been

883
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,160
published in 2016 under the lead of a

884
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,899
Minister of Interior and the core body

885
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,970
to reflect this a whole-of-government

886
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,740
approach with national cyber defence

887
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,750
centre where we have all the

888
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,649
institutions that have a role in on

889
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,530
cyber security in Germany under one roof

890
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,270
so when it's including my organization

891
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,650
but it's also including the intelligence

892
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,170
services it's including the criminal

893
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:51,320
office it's including the federal office

894
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:54,410
for IT security and also all the major

895
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,820
players and the most important thing is

896
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,589
I think you have to get at the whole of

897
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,630
government at a government level

898
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,120
situational awareness and there's a lot

899
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,800
of entities contributing to this but are

900
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,500
not all under the light of a Ministry of

901
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,660
Defense so this is the basis for any

902
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,630
action that you might intend to do and

903
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,879
also to get the resilience and with

904
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,830
therefore this defense center where we

905
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,540
are part of it is for us a crucial

906
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,250
element and we have to look how we

907
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,259
further evolve this what has to be done

908
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,020
to get this in a kind of operational

909
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:27,470
able to act at a state level to certain

910
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,690
threats um one of the themes we've

911
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,959
talked about broadly so far and some of

912
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:35,090
the opening comments this morning is how

913
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,700
cyber really is that is the ultimate

914
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,590
team activity that it takes multiple

915
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,629
expertise multiple different

916
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,260
organizations so I'd like to focus on

917
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:47,180
partners and teammates for a moment so

918
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,190
I'd like you to talk about who are your

919
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,589
key partners and I'd specifically ask

920
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,150
you can um finito specifically as you

921
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,290
talk about who your partners are can you

922
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,940
specifically talk about the role of

923
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,790
industry with what you're trying to do

924
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,910
and the role of the academic world so

925
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,170
Ludwig I'll ask you good I I start with

926
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,810
the partners of course I think

927
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,340
International Cooperation of course is

928
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,200
mandatory necessary a bit under the

929
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,780
classical organizations NATO and

930
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,450
European Union for many reasons in order

931
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,880
to standardize to harmonize to establish

932
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,680
processes so that we have a mutual

933
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,780
understanding if you are using certain

934
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,000
words but not one nation is

935
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,110
understanding a and the our nation's

936
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,200
understanding V so there's a lot of

937
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,670
reasons for international cooperation in

938
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,259
this has to be done on a on an

939
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,670
organizational basis but also I think on

940
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,080
a bilateral basis we are doing both of

941
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:38,510
it on the national level industry I

942
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,250
think is an important factor as well

943
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,620
because there's a lot of things where we

944
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,440
already depending on industry because

945
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,000
industry is providing our capabilities

946
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,980
that's one thing but also if you're

947
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,750
looking internet service providers for

948
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:54,110
example they only very have the key

949
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:57,530
force to do certain things it's not in

950
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:59,570
our hands so we need also to to consider

951
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,240
how we involve in a whole-of-government

952
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,800
approach at least some key industries

953
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,930
and that's a discussion that we are also

954
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,090
taking on specifically the Internet

955
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:10,940
service providers in order to be able to

956
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,660
provide resilience and to react right we

957
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,120
need them as well

958
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,910
academia is another important thing

959
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,230
because we academia is driving our

960
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,790
capabilities we go in the future and we

961
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,980
have established for example at the

962
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:25,630
University in Munich an institution

963
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,630
where we bring academia industry

964
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,790
Universal University training together

965
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,030
in order to foster these topics as well

966
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,759
Maria

967
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:38,750
but teammates for you so when it comes

968
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:43,160
to partners NATO the Alliance there

969
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:44,810
other European Union that are not NATO

970
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:50,330
partners necessarily that are not part

971
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:54,830
of NATO rather our key for us any ally

972
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:57,170
in in Europe is is their very key and as

973
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:00,830
I mentioned earlier we do a lot in terms

974
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:03,650
of information sharing with those those

975
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:05,120
partners and because it's really you

976
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,300
know quite frankly it's a it's a form of

977
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:11,450
deterrence and so when it comes to the

978
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:16,130
commercial or industry piece we we work

979
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:18,020
very closely with that and not just so

980
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,620
much in our communication side but also

981
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,900
on the logistics side and so you know

982
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:29,390
the it's it's really important for us to

983
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:32,270
understand what are our partners and

984
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:35,270
allies have their capabilities in terms

985
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,130
of critical infrastructure and so so we

986
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:40,940
work very closely with that we try to

987
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,100
exercise that and and understand that

988
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,150
better as well as reach out to those

989
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,299
those specific those specific industries

990
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:55,280
and then finally when it comes to

991
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:57,980
academia from you know from a from

992
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,990
European Command perspective we we do

993
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:04,850
quite a bit with John Hopkins University

994
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:05,359
and we've done some things with Lincoln

995
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:13,040
labs

996
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:15,020
Abed with MIT and and that's the

997
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,110
Massachusetts Information Technology

998
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,180
Institute of Technology sorry and so

999
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,010
we've done you know and and having them

1000
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,990
come in and look and talk with us and

1001
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,400
look at some assessments with critical

1002
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,350
infrastructure

1003
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,720
there's certainly a it you know it's it

1004
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:36,890
whether it's industry or academia very

1005
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:41,089
much our our key players in that we also

1006
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:42,440
have several long-standing relationships

1007
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,620
with the National Defense University

1008
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:49,400
also out of Fort McNair that's you know

1009
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:53,000
out of the DoD in Washington DC thanks

1010
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,710
Francesca yes thank you for this the

1011
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,760
beauty of being part of the cyber

1012
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:00,410
community is you belong to an ecosystem

1013
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,570
where is not just a matter of being

1014
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,490
specialized inside but you need to

1015
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,950
communicate with different environments

1016
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:09,229
which is if you are a University's not

1017
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:12,350
just a matter of computer science it's

1018
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:14,030
also psychology anthropology social

1019
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,980
study and so on and so on

1020
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,290
so I think the best example of

1021
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,490
collaboration comes from the what the

1022
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:24,140
Admiral called ins Shakti the FFC I the

1023
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,779
framework for collaborative initial

1024
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,879
initiative so what we have done in Italy

1025
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:32,170
like Shakti does in the world especially

1026
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:36,110
in the mc/dc serious the multiple

1027
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:40,480
capability development campaign we take

1028
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:43,700
hand by hand an idea and and support the

1029
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,860
industry expert in that part and get

1030
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,290
together with University so that with

1031
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,660
the research we deployed the best

1032
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:54,140
solution at that time for it

1033
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,549
we military refine the idea and so we

1034
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,310
probably come out with the best

1035
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,340
procurement and because I said you need

1036
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:03,529
to build your own commander control also

1037
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,870
I think a consideration to bring in is

1038
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:09,200
the role of the center of excellencies

1039
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:11,509
let's not forget Shakti as more than 20

1040
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,600
center of excellence around the world so

1041
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:17,360
if it's really an ecosystem then there's

1042
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,069
need to be communication among all the

1043
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,140
center of excellence you can participate

1044
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,960
I'm thinking about modeling and

1045
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:27,259
simulation security force assistance or

1046
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,840
C to center of excellence and so on so

1047
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:33,050
that we pick the best from every single

1048
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,420
area of expertise so thanks a lot to

1049
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,850
society the great job they do with these

1050
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,700
new solutions in the multi national

1051
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,078
domain

1052
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,848
very good we're gonna open up to

1053
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,950
questions in just women amendment do one

1054
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:45,869
last final question for my German and

1055
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,240
Italian teammates the US has talked

1056
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:50,160
about the role that Cyber Command played

1057
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,740
in the election process Europe has just

1058
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,779
finished an EU election cycle this week

1059
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,729
as a matter of fact I'm just curious for

1060
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,619
my German and my Italian teammates did

1061
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,690
you have any role in election security

1062
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:03,900
in your respective nations or no is that

1063
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,339
outside your responsibility in Germany

1064
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,339
it's not my responsibility it's on the

1065
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:11,460
Minister of Interior it's not by my

1066
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:14,520
responsibility as a military command but

1067
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,890
I'm part of the cyber system in Italy

1068
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,410
there was a particular attention have no

1069
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:22,200
report I was there they probably called

1070
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,910
yesterday in the office check and with

1071
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,279
that let's we have 10 minutes left let's

1072
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:31,109
open it up to questions any questions

1073
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:37,290
for the panel I see one about third row

1074
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:38,369
back on that side over there good

1075
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,109
morning Madame gentlemen thank you for

1076
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:41,609
coming in speaking to us today so you

1077
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:44,670
mentioned applying traditional military

1078
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:46,470
taxes and understanding to cyberspace so

1079
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,849
my question is how can NATO deny our

1080
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,740
potential adversaries freedom of

1081
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,359
maneuver and impose costs on them as

1082
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,339
well as dictate the tempo of these

1083
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:57,359
battles and conflicts when capabilities

1084
00:48:53,339 --> 00:49:03,630
and defensive lines are dynamic any of

1085
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:07,500
the three give him a yes or no I'll go

1086
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:10,500
before I forget Ian I think the matter

1087
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,530
is just lately in the past few years in

1088
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,950
the conference's we have seen we have

1089
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:18,720
associated that deterrence to a great

1090
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,970
defense of the system more than

1091
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,390
offensive we need to continue in that

1092
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:27,419
because someone else will build a higher

1093
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,450
level than the wall itself and so

1094
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,060
someone is always going to be able to go

1095
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:35,910
through the lines of defense I think

1096
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,859
what really we need to do is info

1097
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:41,040
sharing we had this discussion yesterday

1098
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:43,470
at the cyber commander forum which means

1099
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,990
an Eightball neighbor watch program

1100
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:48,598
where you can tell your ally and friend

1101
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:51,000
what is happening in your networks and

1102
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,410
share this experience with the others

1103
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,960
because for sure

1104
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,990
someone else will be infected by these

1105
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,590
intrusions because there's a proxy

1106
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:03,959
approach to the network warfare so M for

1107
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:08,570
sharing I think is the key solution key

1108
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:12,330
I agree with that and I would also add

1109
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:15,960
talking with a common vocabulary a

1110
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:18,900
common lexicon which you know NATO is

1111
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:22,320
working on doing for cyberspace

1112
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:24,630
operations specifically because it you

1113
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,760
know just like we saw a little bit

1114
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:30,380
yesterday even you know different

1115
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,030
different words mean different things to

1116
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:36,720
two different nations when it comes to

1117
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:39,450
cyber cyberspace and I just a foot stomp

1118
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:43,169
what my colleagues said is you know

1119
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:44,879
defense is deterrence in this area and

1120
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,580
we have to have a common defense a

1121
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,080
common cyber posture and that's why I

1122
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,060
think situational awareness is so

1123
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:57,029
important and as well as the the

1124
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:58,830
information sharing ok next question and

1125
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:04,950
I see one it will go towards the back a

1126
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:06,540
little bit is it not all right I think

1127
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:09,600
you very much differences until senior

1128
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:12,390
researcher from the 80s relation my

1129
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,549
question is for Mia Marie or Mike what

1130
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,980
defense posture in cyberspace would you

1131
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,130
like to see your European allies adopt

1132
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,200
or as caress differently should the

1133
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,110
Germans and Italians be able to defend

1134
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:28,589
forward in u.s. infrastructure and a

1135
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:32,850
quick yes and no question if I may this

1136
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:34,740
is one part right does neutrality exist

1137
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:37,230
for you in cyberspace meaning is there

1138
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,450
green space in cyberspace Thanks

1139
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,180
so you can pick any one of the four

1140
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:44,279
questions I thought I heard actually

1141
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,589
pick the one that you like so I think it

1142
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,110
goes back to a common you know defensive

1143
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:53,400
posture an understanding situational

1144
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:55,920
awareness you know we all you know all

1145
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,530
nations are sovereign nations with with

1146
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,880
laws and and national laws and policies

1147
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,480
and governance and so I think it's

1148
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,690
important that we have some level of

1149
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,450
commonality it might not be the same

1150
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:11,630
in Italy as it is in Germany potentially

1151
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,460
or in the US but that's okay as long as

1152
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,250
we have some some commonality and we

1153
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:19,670
have common situational awareness on the

1154
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:22,430
defense side and again it just I think

1155
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:25,400
that's why the the information sharing

1156
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,930
is so important I in and I stress it's

1157
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,019
information it's not intelligence

1158
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:34,180
sharing so I think that's what how we we

1159
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:36,609
can get after that next question

1160
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:39,730
I'll try right up front

1161
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:43,369
thank you and my question is about the

1162
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:46,099
collaboration between the military space

1163
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:47,900
and companies but not so much companies

1164
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:50,029
helping the military space but the

1165
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:53,539
opposite so we know that the majority of

1166
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:55,940
attacks are actually on companies and I

1167
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:59,839
believe that the military could have a

1168
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:02,480
role in defending companies from attacks

1169
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,730
do you have any policy on that so

1170
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:10,819
thoughts please Francesca I'm gonna use

1171
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:14,690
the yes and no card yes we are doing we

1172
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:16,750
are applying this approach also a kind

1173
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:20,930
of answering to the to the other

1174
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,559
question and give you the real answer to

1175
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:24,379
what you asked

1176
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:26,029
si cyber commander a military cyber

1177
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:30,980
commander what I really want is a

1178
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:32,450
permanent role in the watch room I want

1179
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,640
to know everything that is happening

1180
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,189
right there as a fighter pilot I would

1181
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,710
never enter a fight without knowing who

1182
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:41,809
is their enemies friends allies

1183
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:44,720
everything and so on so I need the

1184
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:48,440
permanent radar on the networks if I

1185
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,200
have that then I think I need to guide

1186
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,079
the industry in the academia in

1187
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,328
designing my real tool to do cyber

1188
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,539
operation and I'm doing this with a

1189
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:02,509
close connection with the industry and

1190
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:06,140
explain them clearly every single

1191
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:10,359
details or of the capability I won in

1192
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:13,788
every single sector anyone else just

1193
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:17,210
really in Germany the responsibility to

1194
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:18,930
defend the networks of industries or to

1195
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,280
protect the industry it's

1196
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:24,210
ability the first place of Industry

1197
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,579
itself and of course there's an office

1198
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,170
under the Minister of Interior of a

1199
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,119
federal office for IT security that is

1200
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,010
provided providing some some guidance

1201
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,890
also some commitments that they have to

1202
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,970
do in if something happening in of a

1203
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,618
certain scale they have to report

1204
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,640
certain things to the government but

1205
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,579
it's a responsibility of the

1206
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
organization itself first to protect it

1207
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:47,390
time for one more question

1208
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,390
we'll go and towards the back here

1209
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,839
members of the panel my name is Kevin

1210
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,220
deploy from the United States Military

1211
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,558
Academy and I was hoping you could

1212
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,480
explain how a state analyzes the

1213
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,970
proportionality of a response to a cyber

1214
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,089
attack given the disparity in nature and

1215
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:06,899
effect of different attacks thank you

1216
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:09,359
so proportionality comments yeah I think

1217
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,000
there's a decision by heads of states at

1218
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:15,029
NATO but also a cyber attack can cause

1219
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,680
an article 5 situation but does not mean

1220
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,809
but in cyber tech has to be answered

1221
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,919
with a cyber attack but it's all

1222
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:24,180
possible actions possible with me

1223
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,609
starting with diplomatic actions

1224
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:30,118
economic actions cyber actions or even

1225
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:32,910
use of kinetic so this is not a

1226
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:36,030
one-to-one relationship it's it's open

1227
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:40,170
if such threshold is reached by a cyber

1228
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:42,720
attack any other this is the topic of

1229
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:45,210
the air and the CAS a probably will take

1230
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,598
a couple of years to define every single

1231
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:50,480
response this studies on the table I

1232
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,950
think we need to prepare first

1233
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,619
capability how to respond and then

1234
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:58,828
measure proportionality which we pretty

1235
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:03,359
much don't know yet how we can cause

1236
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:04,920
collateral effects and I'd only make one

1237
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,990
comment having participated in

1238
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,030
discussions in the US with our national

1239
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,790
leadership as we were thinking about how

1240
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,970
we were gonna spawn Sony not petya other

1241
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:16,500
incidents we used you know my input

1242
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,720
always was we should use the exact same

1243
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,280
framework for proportionality in the

1244
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,109
cyber world that we do in the physical

1245
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,750
world there shouldn't be difference we

1246
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:26,220
should use a standard methodology here

1247
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,770
and clearly the legal and policy

1248
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:32,310
framework is going to be very critical

1249
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:34,380
here with that I'd like to thank the

1250
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,240
thank you very very much for a very

1251
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,550
comprehensive and very straightforward

1252
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,540
dialogue to the audience thank you very

1253
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:46,420
much for some great questions thank you

1254
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:46,420
[Applause]
