00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,418
ladies and gentlemen after this

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,480
intriguing insight from the cyber

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,099
commanders we now turn to a glance at

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,190
the future challenges of cyber security

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,769
for infrastructures and for the academic

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,139
keynote speech it's my pleasure to

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,320
welcome professor Alberto san giovanni

awarded the OEE /r se maximum medal for

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,440
groundbreaking contributions that have

19
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,269
had an exceptional impact on the

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,459
development of electronics and electric

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,980
and electric engineering or related

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,199
fields he received an honorary

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,930
doctorates from my home country all

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,689
Brook University Denmark and one from

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,799
kth in Sweden

26
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,039
professor Sanjeevani Venter telly has

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,640
published more than 950 papers and 19

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,670
books finally professor san giovanni

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,909
vegetal ii is not only a great academic

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,500
but also the co-founder of two companies

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,530
in the electronic design information

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
space both of them very successful each

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,479
with a billion dollar revenue so it's my

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,380
great honor to give the floor to you sir

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,030
and I'm sure that you will give us a

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,710
great academic keynote speech Hank

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,909
thanks Ari thank you very much

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,030
[Applause]

39
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,670
thank you for and for being here and my

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,060
question about the relationship between

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,490
military and civil at the reason because

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm going to focus on the importance of

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,880
infrastructure and how important it is

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,530
to defend the infrastructure so the what

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,689
I would like to talk about is in fact

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,420
what kind of risk we are going to have

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:11,850
it infrastructural level and what kind

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:15,720
of challenges that we find to battle

49
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,920
against all kind of negative forces out

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,910
there some of the important

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,369
infrastructures are of course energy

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,540
infrastructure and which has been the

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,370
subject of the most important attacks to

54
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,679
severe infrastructure and the

55
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,519
transportation system where we have not

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,620
seen yet an attack but I'm afraid we

57
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,420
will see it very soon the other

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,230
infrastructures kind of interesting is

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:49,828
health now we are depending more and

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:52,048
more often on cyber solutions to health

61
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:55,019
problems from devices that we carry in

62
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,549
our own body and my own University we

63
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,799
have developed a chip that can be

64
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,720
implanted in your brain and with this

65
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,359
chip you can communicate with the

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,880
Internet is research but it is possible

67
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,859
to do so and then you can imagine the

68
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,350
danger of being hacked by someone

69
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:13,530
directly in your brain right so

70
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,380
infrastructure is important so without

71
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:20,840
further ado let's going the body of the

72
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:23,400
talk so we said the energy distribution

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,160
infrastructure and we know that have

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,329
been attacked you know Ukraine is has

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,739
taken down the energy network in United

76
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,730
States there have been a number of

77
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,220
attacks some known some less known why

78
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,480
is that because it's easy to take down

79
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:49,019
we energy infrastructure so much so that

80
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:52,929
the fear of the United States is that in

81
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,329
the next few years very few years the

82
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,969
Lee hood that someone is going to take

83
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:02,260
down the entire energy infrastructure is

84
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:05,200
very real so much of a 3/4 of the CEOs

85
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,769
of energy companies are sure that within

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,569
two years the energy infrastructure in

87
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,900
the United States is going to be down

88
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:18,190
now a estimate of the damage of such an

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,100
action range from 250 billion to one

90
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,870
trillion dollar okay so this is real and

91
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,680
this is very very dangerous

92
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:32,199
in my opinion is a mistake to think that

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,509
infrastructure or what is the world of

94
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,330
companies for example energy companies

95
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:40,090
should be left alone to fight the battle

96
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,580
against cyber attacks this is a

97
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,440
something that we all have to join

98
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:50,258
together to stop and to prevent now one

99
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,259
of the issues that we see as being the

100
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:55,060
danger in distribution network and this

101
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,030
is just a literacy tea but could be gas

102
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,690
could be water is the fact that there

103
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,138
are a lot of devices in these systems

104
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,020
that are old and they are non protected

105
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,940
the moment in which you bring in

106
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,099
digitalization which is like the key

107
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,349
word that everybody is talking about for

108
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:17,800
the future of the economy you are

109
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:20,699
exposing all these all devices to

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,509
attacks and they are completely

111
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:29,050
defenseless now by the same token we

112
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:32,470
have to consider that things like the

113
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:38,470
smart grid is opening all kind of holes

114
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:40,330
in the infrastructure now anytime we

115
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,130
think about digitalization we think

116
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,349
about two or three things one is

117
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,659
artificial intelligent and the other one

118
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,570
is Internet of Things and Internet of

119
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,310
Things means that all devices that you

120
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,219
have around you are going to be

121
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,570
connected mostly through the internet

122
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,229
and that's the reason why it's called

123
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:03,750
Internet of Things but these devices are

124
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:05,599
very small and not very powerful but

125
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,570
they can create

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,350
havock because of the numbers of these

127
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,060
devices so it is estimated that by 2020

128
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,840
we are going to have more than 50

129
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:21,620
billion devices by 2025 we are going to

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,169
have 1,000 devices per person worldwide

131
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,430
so no matter if you are a young kid or

132
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:32,300
an old guy 1000 devices every time you

133
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,870
add a device to the interconnection you

134
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,090
are opening a door and so think about

135
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,690
the vulnerability that we are going to

136
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:45,229
face so in my opinion the major obstacle

137
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,510
to the future of digitalization is

138
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,570
security because of this issue of

139
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,020
opening doors all over the place now in

140
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,770
fact you can even use the Internet of

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,900
Things to attack the infrastructure and

142
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,650
we have seen for example we attack in

143
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,620
United States that has been flu lamps

144
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,400
you know intelligent smart lamps that I

145
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,470
have created denial of services that has

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,200
taken down the major corporation in

147
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,390
United States and that I started from

148
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,950
Internet of Things so of the famous door

149
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,860
which were opening and we are not

150
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,830
realizing what are the side effects of

151
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,380
opening these doors now if we look at

152
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,750
the number of sites that have been

153
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,870
created in the Internet and we have seen

154
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,990
because many more probably are there but

155
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:44,540
we have not seen them what you see there

156
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:47,060
is doubled from 2017 to 2018 these sites

157
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,370
are the ones that are used to control

158
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,590
the Internet of Things in a negative way

159
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,040
so they are going to take over the

160
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:58,270
Internet of Things and then creating a

161
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,860
serious damage to the infrastructure now

162
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:05,240
it's not only the Internet of Things but

163
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,950
this vent our enterprise is very

164
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,530
vulnerable so the number of

165
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,650
vulnerabilities for a single enterprise

166
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,109
is grown up tremendously the past few

167
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,049
years so we have the distributed

168
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,310
infrastructure we have application and

169
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,170
API of all kind

170
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,690
we have cloud infrastructure and

171
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:27,230
services and so the attack surface is

172
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:31,490
growing but mind you in general the

173
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,600
weakest link of security is us is people

174
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,330
not machines

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,820
it's people and we have seen a number of

176
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,970
attacks that have used remote access

177
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:47,570
employees to gain access to the company

178
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,470
data and control systems now so we are

179
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,020
in a battle

180
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,180
is this a real serious battle so this

181
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,180
one is one of my favorite painters Paulo

182
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,520
China and so this is a very crude

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,400
depiction of what about a looks like and

184
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,199
I take one I mean I couldn't put down

185
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,780
the name but this is one of the

186
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:13,250
companies that I found it and we have

187
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:15,260
about 10,000 attack per day most of them

188
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,740
have not gone through because we are

189
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,890
well defended but boy we would I like to

190
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,130
have some information about the attacks

191
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,300
that may come down the pike and so why

192
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:33,290
can't we also put to work and secret

193
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:38,290
services military everybody to try to

194
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:40,430
stop these damaging situations now they

195
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,230
this one is an example for

196
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:47,300
transportation systems less interference

197
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:51,770
it even notices there are two people far

198
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,439
away they are controlling a car to under

199
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,540
my the way the trick started small oh my

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,610
god there was a picture of Charlie and

201
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,920
Chris in tracksuits

202
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,570
it just appeared on the dashboard but as

203
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,209
I drove down the interstate things

204
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,880
started getting unpleasant and very loud

205
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,640
[Music]

206
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:23,300
at this point the sound system has been

207
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:23,300
activated remotely and then now the wine

208
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:46,740
wipers are going ok so the engine stops

209
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,449
now in this very real very possible you

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,600
can imagine what kind of terroristic

211
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,260
attack you can have by activating a car

212
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,660
from remotely you can provoke accidents

213
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,110
everywhere in a town and you can cripple

214
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,279
completely a town or infrastructure such

215
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:08,490
as a freeway and in fact if we look at

216
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,070
the surface of attack of the car is like

217
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,680
coal under right I am Italian so I like

218
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,500
pasta this is like a colander so you

219
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,140
have so many holes but you can penetrate

220
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,810
into a car in any possible ways it's the

221
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,660
simplest thing that you can do I bet

222
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,839
that my son can do it easily and he is

223
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,420
19 so I can do this no problem at all so

224
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,920
how come it has not happen yet because

225
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,500
there is no money to be made as yet but

226
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,380
will this will happen so there will be

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,160
an attack on the transportation

228
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:47,880
infrastructure so if we think about the

229
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,760
future of transportation there is no

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,699
doubt that some degree of autonomous

231
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,370
driving is going to take place now what

232
00:11:53,699 --> 00:12:01,620
is the issue with autonomous driving

233
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:04,440
well you're adding automation hence you

234
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,769
are adding sensor hence you are adding

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,850
nodes hence your open doors even more

236
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:14,579
and what is already open let's look at

237
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,010
what is the four fundamental question of

238
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,469
autonomous driving so first one is where

239
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,610
am i right so how do you detect where

240
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,129
you are

241
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,100
technology of GPS inertial navigation

242
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:28,829
system and then mapping technology well

243
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,319
you can fool a GPS system you can give

244
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,689
the wrong information to your car what

245
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:35,790
it is and so you can have your car going

246
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:38,488
down a cliff because you are giving the

247
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,860
wrong information to the sensor the next

248
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:43,290
question is what is around me and so you

249
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,929
need vision systems like radars Lee

250
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,589
lighters and so on and you can fool them

251
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:51,509
as well remember and this has not been

252
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:56,970
the result of an attack but think about

253
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:59,399
they be the Boeing 737 max that you know

254
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,299
to accidents what was because of eight

255
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,389
accident with the interaction between

256
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:09,089
sensors and control system now that was

257
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,220
caused by malfunctioning but if I am a

258
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,879
terrorist I can do that as well right

259
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,509
and so I can provoke huge number of

260
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,339
damages in that domain now what will

261
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,589
happen next so when we have an

262
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,470
autonomous driving system given the

263
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,899
situation that I can see what is likely

264
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,169
to happen so that I can react to it so

265
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,389
it's predictive system so software and

266
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,910
algorithms in general and the next one

267
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,489
is what should I do and what should I do

268
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,868
is a decision that you have to take and

269
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:45,869
this decision system today are basically

270
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:47,999
taken with neural networks so artificial

271
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:51,239
intelligence topics so if you look at

272
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:53,730
the enabling technology of autonomous

273
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:56,369
driving is sensor fusion and big data

274
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,939
but we say the interaction between

275
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:04,549
sensors and the computing part of the

276
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:06,748
car is a weak point you can attack it

277
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:10,459
simply what about artificial

278
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:14,249
intelligence is that a robust technology

279
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:17,638
well I have my doubts so here is an

280
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:20,040
example that you can find is a paper

281
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,649
published by Stanford but we also have a

282
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,959
number of example like this and the part

283
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:28,949
of our research in Berkeley of my group

284
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,899
is to try to fool neural networks so

285
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:34,319
that we can prevent bad things from

286
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,900
happen so if you train

287
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,140
neural network on recognizing objects

288
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,010
you can get pretty good results but take

289
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,290
the image of the right we perturb the

290
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:50,040
image and we introduce some random noise

291
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,589
now what you see there is a pattern it

292
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,270
doesn't look like a penguin at all right

293
00:14:52,590 --> 00:15:00,120
but yet neural network decides with

294
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:04,740
99.99 percent assurance that that is a

295
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,870
penguin right so I can do exactly the

296
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,540
same thing on the decision mating of an

297
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,210
automobile as well as any other decision

298
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,240
systems so I would like to stress the

299
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,310
fact don't trust artificial intelligence

300
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,580
too much understand what the limitations

301
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,339
are people I hear people say well we use

302
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:27,420
artificial intelligence to fight cyber

303
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,010
crime be careful understand what you are

304
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,810
getting into and what I have a

305
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:37,760
limitation now in all of this we have to

306
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,160
think about the basis of all this

307
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,020
internet and all of this capability

308
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,240
digital capability which is the

309
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:50,760
semiconductor chip that's the basis

310
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:53,820
that's a common denominator well you can

311
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,790
hack chips too and we'll see how that

312
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,890
Intel is decided to try to use

313
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,260
microprocessor to defend against

314
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:04,170
software attacks so we have devised a

315
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,010
particular algorithm because is called

316
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,430
SGX

317
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:11,280
but allow programs to have an inkling a

318
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,339
particular zone of the memory which is

319
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,160
not accessible except for red one

320
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,080
application well it so happens that if

321
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,800
you give to some researchers at the

322
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,720
University a target like try to prove

323
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,060
that it doesn't work well very well

324
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
right and so they demonstrated that

325
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,859
actually is more damaging than good

326
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,859
because you can put a negative malware

327
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,450
into that protected area and there is

328
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,570
nothing you can do once you have it you

329
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:44,160
have it you cannot get rid of it but

330
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:46,950
there have been two instances of bugs :

331
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,889
quad which are at the architectural

332
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,079
level is not

333
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:53,470
softer miss architecture of the chip

334
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,920
that creates a vulnerability and these

335
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,759
are called meltdown inspector and they

336
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:05,010
were discovered a year ago more or less

337
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:09,039
but they were present in the chip since

338
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:12,158
2010 so it took nine years to to detect

339
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,769
that particular but why did it take so

340
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:16,889
long because it's not simple it's really

341
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,819
difficult to do so this is a

342
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:21,039
illustration on the mekinese but

343
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,799
essentially what happens is that to make

344
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,679
your chip go faster you take some

345
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,139
decisions that are iffy

346
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,750
one of the basis for making your

347
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:34,600
microprose to go fast is to do what is

348
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,460
called speculative execution so you are

349
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,080
trying to guess what your program is

350
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,630
going to tell the chip to do and you

351
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,240
start doing it before the software tells

352
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,389
it to do it and that is a vulnerability

353
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:51,330
so you can attack that particular step

354
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:56,500
of speculative execution to siphon off

355
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:58,990
the cryptid password database and so

356
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,580
that is the ultimate security that we

357
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,409
think it is so to encrypt our passwords

358
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,100
well they are not secure at all you can

359
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:11,200
get to it

360
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,840
so now what is the solution of this box

361
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,289
at the chip level well our research

362
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,720
tells us that we can design chips in

363
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:22,480
such a way that this kind of bugs quote

364
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,419
unquote can never occur and this one is

365
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
a very complex mathematical proof based

366
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:31,149
system but it is possible but you have

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,580
to think about security at the moment in

368
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:36,580
which you are designing the new systems

369
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,330
if you patch it later on it's too late

370
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:43,510
you have to start thinking with security

371
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,629
in mind no matter what you do software

372
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,120
hardware think security seems to a very

373
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,929
first line of code since the very first

374
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,789
line of Reggie's transfer level so what

375
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,639
can we do here so this is another

376
00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:01,210
painting by Paulo cello in st. George

377
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,949
slaying the dragon so well one thing is

378
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,560
that

379
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:09,700
hardware in such a fundamental basis for

380
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,370
security that you can look at anomalies

381
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,580
that are occurring at the hardware level

382
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:19,419
by placing a watchdog it's difficult

383
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:22,270
what you do for example in the case of a

384
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,850
system that made misbehave because they

385
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,150
are broken right so it's a reliability

386
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,699
you check reliability by observing what

387
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,340
happens on the chip itself same thing so

388
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,150
we are proposing to do the same at the

389
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,310
level of the chip to analyze if the chip

390
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,940
is behaving like you think it should

391
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:45,250
behave by the same token the companies

392
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,030
for example in energy like NL is the

393
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,850
largest company in energy in Europe I

394
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,370
believe and what we decided to do is to

395
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,980
team up with a start-up and we startup

396
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,560
is design hardware which is connected to

397
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,010
their SCADA system and they can watch

398
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,649
what is going on at the network level

399
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,470
and detect anomalies is the same

400
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:12,700
solution as we have seen on the chip and

401
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:16,030
this time at the network layer this one

402
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,700
is another solution which is fund

403
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,060
startups right so the private sector and

404
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,420
the new innovative company is always

405
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,510
been very good in solving complex

406
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,970
problems so these are 28 startups that

407
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,360
have been funded in the last 3-4 months

408
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,460
so in 2019 and each one of these

409
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,990
companies is attacking a particular

410
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:43,420
domain of cyber security now some are

411
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,600
very promising so for example oma Marc

412
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:49,570
fig encryption has been a dream of

413
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,600
cryptography since the time of a critic

414
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:56,080
Rafi was born which means that you don't

415
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,179
need to decrypt data to edit the data or

416
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,639
to do something with the data itself you

417
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,250
can operate on the data in encrypted

418
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,040
form so you are removing it puts

419
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:10,810
potential a big potential liability of

420
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:14,110
your systems now the other way is what I

421
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,980
was asking before to the panelist I

422
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,070
can't we

423
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,380
get together can't we have a

424
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:23,168
private-public partnership now in energy

425
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,960
which is sector I know very well the

426
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,570
investment of companies in security is

427
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,750
dismal it's very small compared to the

428
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:36,399
risk why because they don't have enough

429
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:40,980
money to invest in security but the

430
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:45,400
energy infrastructure is vital for a

431
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,770
country so that is a very clear place

432
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,230
when a private public partnership should

433
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,780
take place there are some attempts in

434
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,270
United States but I think that the issue

435
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,370
of resiliency of our infrastructure is a

436
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,220
key one not only in the United States

437
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,379
worldwide and in fact I think this one

438
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,360
is a study that we did in United States

439
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,030
and National Academy of Engineering and

440
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,178
I trust that this should be also

441
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,030
something that the NATO should encourage

442
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:15,040
in Europe so take a look at the

443
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,260
infrastructure see what the

444
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,570
infrastructure in Europe is capable of

445
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,990
doing or not capable of doing this my

446
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,659
slide in this is in my opinion possibly

447
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:30,960
the strongest weakest worldwide that we

448
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:35,049
have is the lack of people so we buy a

449
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,610
estimate by USC square the number of

450
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,650
people that were missing in cyber

451
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,290
security is something like almost three

452
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,450
million people like when we talk about

453
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:49,360
the future of jobs when we talk about

454
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:52,419
people who should be literate in digital

455
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,490
technology security is one such a key

456
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:56,500
thing so if we want to solve part of the

457
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,230
problem we should invest more in

458
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,110
education of people that are very well

459
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,980
versed in security thank you very much

460
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,979
[Applause]
