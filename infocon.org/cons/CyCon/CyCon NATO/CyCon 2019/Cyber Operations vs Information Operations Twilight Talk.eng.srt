1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,930
and welcome to a twilight talk a toilet

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,349
zone there is an app for everything so I

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,280
checked on a app called Sun and Moon

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:17,100
when is a sunset today and it's quarter

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,070
past 10:00 and the Twilight is about in

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,420
a one hour after the sunset so brace

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:28,220
yourself we're going to be locked here

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:33,780
until quarter past 11 p.m. a I do not

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:35,700
intend to introduce the gentlemen we we

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,930
have here at length because we're very

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,140
well known and they're civvies our

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,460
extensive series are on a cycle webpage

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,750
just you know what to save our turbulent

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:54,329
is one of our best researchers varies in

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,730
the world concerning cyber and General

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,530
Petraeus is one of the best generals

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,500
burries in the world both formidable

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,119
intellectuals so it's gonna be a treat

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:16,289
and we will start with session wave herb

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:19,110
who has prepared some points for us to

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,509
kick off the session so her please low

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,060
resource okay so am i it is okay thank

23
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,390
you um so I'm delighted to be here at

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,990
saikhan again thank you for having me

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,460
and and indulging me what I wanted to

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,280
talk about was the difference and

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,309
similarities between cyber operations

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,280
and cyber-enabled information operations

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,880
now there is a tendency these days to

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,130
lump everything under the cyber label

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,070
and I think that that's a mistake

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,259
because solutions for one don't

33
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,908
necessarily cross over to solutions for

34
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,909
the other at the same time there's some

35
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,770
insight to be had by drawing the

36
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,330
similarities drawing some similarities

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,849
and understanding some of the the

38
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,569
differences so let me start with this

39
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,340
which is

40
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,969
is Russian interference in the u.s.

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,159
election of 2016 as an act of cyber war

42
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,780
many people asserted that this was an

43
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,269
act of cyber war against the United

44
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,359
States

45
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,129
Dick Cheney Hillary Clinton a variety of

46
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:32,409
people you mean it's not often that you

47
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,870
get Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney to

48
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,349
agree on something but here but here

49
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,430
they here here here they agree okay I

50
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,689
don't want to point out that there's a

51
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,379
difference a big difference between

52
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,439
cybersecurity thinking about

53
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,939
cybersecurity and defending against

54
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,069
cyber enabled information operations

55
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,159
okay well if you think about cyber war

56
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,099
and cyber conflict they target entities

57
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,939
in in in cyberspace you're able to

58
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:02,469
prosecute it because of flaws in the

59
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,799
technology that you're attacking that is

60
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:08,168
their you know the of design flaws of

61
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,689
design flaws of implementation and so on

62
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,699
by contrast cyber-enabled information

63
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,799
operations part you know uses

64
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:17,979
information to target not computers but

65
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,650
human minds right so adversaries

66
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:24,280
prosecute IO by taking advantage of the

67
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,169
technical virtues of IT that is the

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,060
Russians use Facebook and Twitter and

69
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,939
YouTube and so on exactly as they were

70
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,590
intended to be used right Novum knows

71
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:35,108
you know zero-day vulnerabilities

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,620
they're at least not in the usual sense

73
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:41,849
that we understand the the the term that

74
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,739
used twitter they used Facebook are they

75
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,649
they benefited from the algorithms that

76
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,729
the social media platforms are developed

77
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,989
to increase user engagement with

78
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,120
advertisers and user-generated content

79
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,009
right that's exactly what they that's

80
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,419
what YouTube in the there that's what

81
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:03,309
they're for if you look at the official

82
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,489
US government one.you official US

83
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,409
government definition of cybersecurity

84
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:14,590
it's found in NSP d54 national security

85
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:16,238
directive 54 prevention of debt

86
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,280
cybersecurity is a provision of damage

87
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,459
to protection of restoration of

88
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,359
computers electronic systems are and and

89
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,520
so on okay the target computers right

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,340
information operations

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,190
are they deliberate of use of use of

92
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,460
information to confuse mislead affect

93
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:41,169
the choices of the adversary are that

94
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:44,109
the target is minds right the head there

95
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,120
are some commonalities between them and

96
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,710
of course now the screen is too far away

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,490
so we can't read it so I'm going to

98
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:55,448
stand up III apologize here okay both of

99
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:59,259
them both of them depend on deception

100
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:02,650
okay cyber operations they depend on the

101
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,780
ability to deceive you into clicking on

102
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,638
a link right nobody sends you an email

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,008
says click here and I'll try your hard

104
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,840
disk nobody says that right if there's a

105
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,460
deception in their information

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,150
operations depend on deceptive content

107
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,318
inauthentic attribution economic and

108
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,270
senders reduce attention to

109
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,349
cybersecurity right you don't care about

110
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,090
in and off you don't pay enough

111
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:29,169
attention to the cybersecurity it's too

112
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,750
expensive to use economic there are

113
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,630
economic incentives to exploit cognitive

114
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,449
limitations and to increase the time on

115
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,610
platform right Facebook has incentives

116
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,400
to keep people on their platform as long

117
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,560
as possible and so they are exposed

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,900
potentially to adversary information

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,729
operations so constantly there are

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,349
vulnerabilities in software there are

121
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,860
vulnerabilities in the human mind our

122
00:05:53,349 --> 00:06:00,279
cognitive we call biases and cognitive

123
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:05,289
biases that change the way we perceive

124
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:07,990
the world both brains and computers both

125
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:13,240
have limitations bandwidth memory and

126
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,729
and and the like convenience works

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,409
against cyber security and what the

128
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,169
psychologists call cognitive economy

129
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,279
works against analytical thinking but

130
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,380
you only have a certain amount of

131
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,340
cognitive resources and you can spend

132
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,400
them here or there

133
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,880
and when you're out of it you have to

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,340
wait and fill your replenish or when a

135
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,870
or are you else you just fall back on

136
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,859
your old intuitive thinking you don't

137
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,289
think things through very well

138
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,170
you make much worse decisions when

139
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:45,240
you're hungry or sleepy for exam

140
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,160
for cyber the you know it the the great

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,980
connectivity and inter and integration

142
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,400
of information technology you know they

143
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,290
are strengths right but they're also

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,190
they also turn into vulnerabilities in

145
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,670
cyberspace the First Amendment and

146
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,900
commitments to truth I'm from America

147
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,910
you know from the United States you know

148
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,359
that was a really important to me right

149
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,360
um skeptism that's been turned into what

150
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,620
those have been weaponized against us

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,650
those are those strengths have been

152
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,880
turned into a vulnerability okay for

153
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,989
both of these there are there's a

154
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,730
diffuse locus or response in in the US

155
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,220
government nobody's in charge of this

156
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,290
stuff either for cyber only thirty seven

157
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,730
agencies well no you know dozens of

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,080
agencies in the United States have

159
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,760
something to do with cyber security and

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,120
there's because then nobody responsible

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,890
for a feeling like thinking about IO

162
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,900
they both require not just a

163
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,900
whole-of-government response but a hold

164
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,690
of society response it's hard enough to

165
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,229
get a hold of government response

166
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,450
thinking about what it means to

167
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,210
immobilize a whole society to respond

168
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,770
they're both they both require that the

169
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,260
target space is not under government

170
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,859
control that's a good thing right but

171
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,920
it's a problem right private sector owns

172
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,730
lots of the cyber space but the and the

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,980
private sector

174
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,920
you know people individually you own

175
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,080
your own mines and all the people out

176
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,570
there on their own minds I don't want

177
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,859
them under government control but that's

178
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,920
a problem in services developed in

179
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,870
response and in both cases borders are

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,980
ineffective and here's some similarities

181
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,870
you think about it you have to think

182
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,690
about the battle space what's the battle

183
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,290
space in in cyber well it's cyberspace

184
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,200
right the information environment is the

185
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,010
corresponding construct for information

186
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,689
operations and note that it contains

187
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,979
cyberspace in it the other part of it

188
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,660
that's a perfect physical and

189
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,780
informational then there's the cognitive

190
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:47,280
part of it the cognitive dimension of of

191
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,620
the information environment that is how

192
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,750
people think about stuff you can talk

193
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,350
about cyber capabilities offensive cyber

194
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,520
capabilities in terms of acts

195
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,710
any access software hardware

196
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,870
vulnerabilities and payloads if you have

197
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,890
psychological operations as requiring

198
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,700
access to the users make the people

199
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,319
cognitive taking advantage of their

200
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,500
cognitive vulnerabilities and using

201
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,230
tailored content to exploit those

202
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,130
voltage argument of older abilities

203
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,160
think about the different kinds of

204
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,350
impact that you might have on by

205
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,780
targeting information technology the

206
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,460
usual confidentiality integrity

207
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,740
availability

208
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,940
there's impact on humans too you can use

209
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,980
IO to inform to persuade to distract the

210
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,270
obvious Kate the mislead provoke

211
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:38,260
confused and the like you think about

212
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:43,500
viruses propagating in cyberspace ok

213
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:45,880
viruses in and and worms as ways of

214
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:51,370
conducting attacked here network

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,780
segmentation helps because it stops in

216
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,820
from you know a virus from going from

217
00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:00,010
one place to another in the information

218
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,810
of our a talk it you talk about messages

219
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,770
going viral the contents of those

220
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:09,010
messages can be good or bad and there

221
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:13,810
come community segmentation hurts you

222
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,800
situational awareness okay so so that's

223
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,239
a difference okay

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,819
the nature of the intelligence required

225
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,120
both are heavily dependent on good

226
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:29,170
intelligence side but I would argue that

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,200
cyberspace is really dependent on good

228
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,120
tactical intelligence and it's mostly

229
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,520
classified it's mostly hard to obtain by

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,950
contrast understanding the intelligence

231
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,660
even further I oh I think it's mostly

232
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,900
strategic that is you have to understand

233
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,280
the political situation on the ground

234
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,660
you have to understand their societal

235
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,220
fault lines you have to know who you the

236
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,600
useful idiots are it's open it's easy to

237
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,270
obtain it's hard to analyze but it's

238
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:04,110
easy to obtain both pay a lot of

239
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,100
attention to pre quote pre-conflict

240
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,150
there's a shaping of the cyberspace

241
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,220
environment you have to

242
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,319
gain access to your targets you have to

243
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,780
identify targets and so on well in

244
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,610
advance of when you want to attack them

245
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,260
I'm in the information environment you

246
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,680
have to do a lot of preparation before

247
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,240
you actually launch an operation for

248
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,329
example you want to establish the

249
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,520
accounts for the the Twitter account and

250
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:32,080
whatnot for gaining influence you want

251
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,640
to gain influence and credibility before

252
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,230
you start the operation and you have to

253
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
participate you have to persuade people

254
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,570
that you're a credible source that

255
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,730
you're credible party you want to lay

256
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,990
the groundwork so that others can do

257
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:53,500
your dirty work think about different

258
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,060
kinds of operation in cyberspace there's

259
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,550
a cyber attack cyber exploitation that

260
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,729
we've all know about in different kinds

261
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,439
of operations in the information of army

262
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,080
can think about propaganda what I quote

263
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,000
this is my own taxonomy it's nothing

264
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,380
particularly original about it but these

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,130
are useful things

266
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,230
chaos production and leaks different

267
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,660
kinds of operation intended to cause

268
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,770
different kinds of effects and you can

269
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,770
think about different ways of protecting

270
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,470
okay in cyberspace I just have three I

271
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,210
have four categories that I that are

272
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,530
worth talking about here

273
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,910
by the way I'll send these slides to

274
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,839
anybody who wants them just send me an

275
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:34,870
email and I'll be happy to send them you

276
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,120
can avoid you can detect you can defend

277
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,230
and you can recover in both cyberspace

278
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,170
and in the information environment all

279
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,280
those things on the left you recognize

280
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,310
using the internet less as a way of

281
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:53,410
avoiding a way of avoiding doing anomaly

282
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:55,930
detection for for detection for defense

283
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,839
writing more secure code patching and

284
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,719
the life recovering doing backups and so

285
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,820
on an avoidant in the information space

286
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,880
for IO to defend against it even what he

287
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,450
can do you can use social media less you

288
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,480
can avoid untrusted or bias sources you

289
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,550
can for detection you have to identify

290
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,720
an information campaign against you in

291
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,900
progress you have to do you have to

292
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,450
recognize it as such

293
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,480
notice that's really difficult to detect

294
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,260
in an environment in which a society is

295
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,790
already riven by conflict okay Russians

296
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,950
all they have they don't they can it's

297
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,790
harder than to create conflict it's

298
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,080
easier them to amplify existing conflict

299
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,880
defense you could do media literacy

300
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,920
fact-checking and and and so on you

301
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,130
change business models to inhibit spread

302
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,689
of information all those things are good

303
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,910
from a defense standpoint for recovery

304
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,370
you can issue Corrections you can

305
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,170
undertake retrospective attribution you

306
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,380
can try to isolate targets and so let

307
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,510
audio instance from each other I point

308
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,279
out one interesting characteristic about

309
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,300
this which I I wish I put on this slide

310
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,300
and I had forgotten about it

311
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,930
for cyber protection okay if you want to

312
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,170
protect myself in cyberspace everybody

313
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,969
who owns a computer recognizes that at

314
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,860
least you know what's that computer to

315
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,029
be protected may not take all the right

316
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,600
action but they want to be protected

317
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:30,130
your target audience in the information

318
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,029
right in in information operations not

319
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:36,400
all of them want to be protected this is

320
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,200
a policymaker I can take make the

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,470
assumption if I'm trying to protect

322
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,360
people in cyberspace that every every

323
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,880
owner of a computer wants that computer

324
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,410
protected I can as a policy man I can't

325
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,310
make that assumption about my entire

326
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,439
population not everybody wants to be

327
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,810
protected and I'll point out that on the

328
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,550
right hand side many of the items there

329
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,609
that I've listed as elements of

330
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,609
protection they have to they involve the

331
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,610
person being targeted wanting to be

332
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,160
protected they have to want to be media

333
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,700
literate they have to want to detect to

334
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,910
care about facts they want to have the

335
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:20,440
want to use social media less that's

336
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:22,959
some problem right so these are some of

337
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,450
the thoughts that I have here and I

338
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,459
would love to hear you know to engage in

339
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,459
a discussion here so they can wish

340
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:42,219
and do you disco Street to you for

341
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,230
reflections on on what it just sit well

342
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,080
first of all privilege to be back here

343
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,820
congratulations to the organizers for

344
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,850
putting on yet another very very

345
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,340
stimulating endeavor herb that was

346
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,080
terrific thanks for dressing up for us

347
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,410
to death and never seen you in a jacket

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,690
before I was gonna compliment you on

349
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,270
having a shirt with a collar I thought

350
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,620
that was and I want to reassure you that

351
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,770
there assure you that I have no

352
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,470
PowerPoint slides I am keenly aware that

353
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:14,860
as a general officer while on active

354
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,290
duty I was authorized and encouraged to

355
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,440
use PowerPoint and exercising my First

356
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:24,069
Amendment free speech rights but I have

357
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,080
sworn off those since retiring I want to

358
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,150
make two points actually and only the

359
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,450
second one is going to comment on what I

360
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:33,850
thought was a very thought-provoking

361
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,010
briefing herb the first is actually to

362
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,270
reflect a little bit on what we have

363
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:42,400
heard today because I think that we have

364
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,670
to be careful and I'm talking from the

365
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,800
u.s. perspective to a degree here we

366
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,500
have to be careful not to make too much

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,859
of what seems to be a really

368
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,130
revolutionary development in the US

369
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:01,720
where the United States is actually

370
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:05,800
going on the offense if you will yes

371
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,780
Cyber Command has publicly acknowledged

372
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,859
the Department of Defense has

373
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:15,180
acknowledged that they used cyber if you

374
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:19,389
will offensive capabilities to disrupt

375
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:23,470
the actions of the Islamic state in

376
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:28,140
cyberspace as an effort to augment or

377
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:31,450
make truly comprehensive the campaign to

378
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,010
defeat the Islamic state which obviously

379
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,170
was conducted in so much as the Islamic

380
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,300
state as an army was defeated not

381
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,400
Islamic state as insurgent groups or

382
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,830
terrorist elements we're going to see

383
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:47,300
them emerge I think as they read or

384
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:50,360
more worryingly than then may be

385
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,520
expected but they help take that down

386
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,610
and that was complemented in turn by a

387
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:00,920
kinetic focus on the cyber capabilities

388
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,990
of Isis they destroyed the Raqqa

389
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,630
operational center not only did they

390
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,420
destroy the servers and switches but

391
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:12,710
also killed many of the leaders of that

392
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,990
entity and that was a big deal

393
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,060
task force Ares built around actually

394
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,610
general na Cassone commanded at that

395
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,580
time the US Army cyber which general

396
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,649
Hernandez was the first commander of

397
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,020
some years ago that was a very big deal

398
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,990
and then of course we have seen the

399
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,420
public acknowledgment that Cyber Command

400
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,770
used some offensive capabilities to

401
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:46,150
disrupt actions of Russian elements on

402
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:49,040
the eve of our midterm election in 2018

403
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,230
this is obviously not the first time we

404
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,230
have used offensive cyber capabilities

405
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,380
in the United States this capability has

406
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,300
been around for a while I can't talk

407
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,280
about some of the capabilities that we

408
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,500
may have exercised because if they were

409
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,480
at that time they would have been under

410
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,240
what's called covert action authorities

411
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,920
rather than title 50 rather than title

412
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,800
10 which is Department of Defense

413
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,380
military activities title 50 being of

414
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,840
course the CIA covert action authorities

415
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,780
but you can read David's angers book

416
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,260
about Stuxnet and and determine what

417
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,540
happened there and there are some other

418
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:31,700
examples that at least are out in the

419
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:34,310
public realm and I think though that we

420
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,780
are not going to see as much offensive

421
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,250
activity as again people expect that you

422
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,810
know the military commanders have always

423
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,360
been frustrated that we're not doing

424
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,889
more of this look no one knows this

425
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,050
better than the guy who commanded the

426
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,590
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and

427
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,200
Central Command at their height and it

428
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,820
was very very interesting the

429
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,290
perspective that I had as a

430
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,000
commander on the battlefield where I

431
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:05,090
wanted to see these activities taken

432
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,800
down why do we allow inspire magazine

433
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,330
the magazine of al Qaeda and the Arabian

434
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:15,050
Peninsula a very very effective

435
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,419
electronic magazine a zine especially

436
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,430
because they had American colloquial

437
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,490
English speaking individuals some

438
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,210
actually had us dual citizenship were

439
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,210
the ones who were the editors of this

440
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:32,600
and then when I got when I became the

441
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,180
director of the CIA I realized that

442
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,719
number one it's not as easy to take

443
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,120
something down and keep it down as I

444
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,710
thought it was as a four-star even

445
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,629
though we had obviously all kinds of

446
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,150
title 50 authorities supporting us I

447
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,890
just never sat and work through okay

448
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,890
then what and then what and then what

449
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:56,120
and then what ultimately is they pop

450
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:58,520
back up which by the way remember Isis

451
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,510
is still active in cyberspace we have

452
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:05,030
not defeated Isis the Cyber Caliphate we

453
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,160
have taken away the ground caliphate not

454
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,560
the cyber caliphate have we disrupted it

455
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,280
at various times certainly but you want

456
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,280
to do that I think for strategic reasons

457
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,540
may be operational but not just

458
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,230
constantly because every time you take

459
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,070
it down you are exposing your methods or

460
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:27,860
possibly your sources and capabilities

461
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:30,770
and if you understand the value of

462
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,540
watching something and you could say

463
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,770
that this is persistent engagement

464
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,060
because that would be an accurate

465
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,590
description you recognize that maybe you

466
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,480
don't want to take it down and maybe

467
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,780
there's even some this gives you some

468
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,000
options if you need to at some point in

469
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,740
a very strategic way there are some if

470
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,190
you can think about this again without

471
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:56,180
getting into details what this actually

472
00:21:52,190 --> 00:22:00,020
gives you the capability to do and I

473
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,030
think again that as this evolves began

474
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,190
much discussion that finally this

475
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,320
finally were on offense finally we're

476
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,750
using these capabilities we have always

477
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,590
had these capabilities have we developed

478
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,669
in various

479
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:16,220
Stanly further by adding the so-called

480
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:20,600
national cyber mission task force 133

481
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,580
teams it's over 6000 in total summer 30

482
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:28,039
plus summer 60 there's different

483
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:31,189
capabilities and organizations yes that

484
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:35,419
is a huge augmentation of American

485
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:39,200
military cyber capability but look we've

486
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:41,960
had NSA for decades and NSA long before

487
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,220
this transition from being a traditional

488
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:50,390
signals intelligence organization to

489
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:53,289
being arguably the best cyber element in

490
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,149
the world together with certainly the

491
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,610
publicly known the IOC the information

492
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:01,939
Operations Center at the CIA and then

493
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,820
when you put together what the CIA can

494
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,830
do with its capabilities that if you

495
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,289
can't get in through cyberspace perhaps

496
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:12,529
there's another way to get in let your

497
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:13,879
imagination run wild you can see that

498
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:16,309
this is a very very substantial

499
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,760
capability and we have had this for some

500
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:23,178
time but we have always argued with

501
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,220
ourselves about what happens if we use

502
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:29,120
an offensive capability and thereby

503
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,279
expose it it's the same as again

504
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,379
disclosing something that gives up a

505
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,860
very valuable source this is a very

506
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,590
valuable capability a very valuable

507
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,350
method and and again I welcome

508
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,129
discussion on this after this if folks

509
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:49,309
and I know that we had the Cyber Command

510
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:53,630
j5 in here but I think we need to be a

511
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:55,610
bit careful again in assessing whether

512
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,409
this means that we're really now on the

513
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,539
offense of all the time in a way that we

514
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,080
have not been in the past keep it in

515
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:04,549
mind in the past if we did do something

516
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,740
it most likely would have been under

517
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:09,139
covert action authorities which means by

518
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,640
definition by law you cannot talk about

519
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,919
it I am aware of only one title 50

520
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,440
covert action ever disclosed

521
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,659
deliberately and that was when President

522
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,350
Obama announced the operation that took

523
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:26,390
down Osama bin Laden which was a covert

524
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,429
for a variety of reasons had it not gone

525
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:32,900
well I was a commander in Afghanistan at

526
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:35,900
the time otherwise what we know about

527
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:40,010
those have come from books like David's

528
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,800
angers or other journalistic endeavors

529
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,090
so that just one to throw out there just

530
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:50,419
perhaps to be a tiny bit provocative

531
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:53,899
with respect to your briefing herb I I

532
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:56,270
thought the big idea here or the light

533
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,880
bulb that came on for me obviously all

534
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,830
of this is you know you would say is

535
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,050
intuitively obvious to the casual

536
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,610
observer as West Point math books used

537
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:09,230
to say especially when it was not

538
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:12,770
intuitively obvious the big idea here I

539
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:16,970
think is the challenge that this

540
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:21,940
presents to democracy is uniquely and

541
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:24,200
the unique ability it may give to

542
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,520
authoritarian governments that wish us

543
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:32,930
ill because of the vulnerability if you

544
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:36,230
will and I use quotes of social media

545
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:39,530
platforms internet service providers and

546
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:42,470
so forth to those who want to do what

547
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:49,070
the Russians did quite effectively in

548
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:54,250
the 2016 elections that is quite

549
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:58,879
profound and I think it highlights a

550
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,400
very serious conundrum right now for all

551
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,860
of societies but especially again for

552
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,220
democracies and especially frankly for

553
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,590
big democracies like the United States

554
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,110
and that is that we are having a hard

555
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,060
time just intellectually keeping up with

556
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:19,000
what's going on in cyberspace and the

557
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:24,429
implications of that much less actually

558
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,410
gathering the support in Congress for

559
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:29,420
legislation we were talking earlier

560
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,510
remember there was this very least

561
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,330
common denominator cybersecurity bill

562
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,040
put up by both a Republican chairman of

563
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,309
the House Intelligence Committee and is

564
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,049
dead

565
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:43,519
kradic leader and that couldn't get

566
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,129
through Congress for another three or

567
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,749
four years so obviously it's way behind

568
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:49,748
the curve when it comes to that

569
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,559
legislation we finally in the United

570
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,269
States just last fall created something

571
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,168
many of us have been calling for for

572
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:02,899
some time which is a cybersecurity and

573
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:04,549
they call it it's an unwieldy title

574
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:07,879
sisse the cybersecurity and

575
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:09,408
infrastructure security agency which is

576
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:13,399
under the Department of Homeland

577
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:16,700
Security which was desperately needed to

578
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:19,580
oversee the most critical infrastructure

579
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,529
cyber security and again much less

580
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,710
policies and regulations and all the

581
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:26,690
other not to mention the capabilities to

582
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,490
actually implement what legislation is

583
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,460
being established given the challenges

584
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,600
of government attracting enough of the

585
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,309
best and brightest in the cyber world

586
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,469
where I think only two organizations

587
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:41,330
truly are having the great success in

588
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,950
that and those are arguably NSA and

589
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:47,840
again CIA and yet this is a whole of

590
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:52,159
society debate because that's what has

591
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,889
to be the response and this is quite

592
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,669
quite significant I mean how do we get

593
00:27:54,889 --> 00:28:00,408
people to get educated on media

594
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,740
consumption media literacy I think your

595
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:06,049
slide said we know that people gravitate

596
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,860
to media bubbles how do we shake them

597
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:13,580
out of that how do you how do we get

598
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:16,248
social media platforms to get much more

599
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,418
on the front foot in addressing the

600
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:21,350
issues that we are seeing emerge

601
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:25,669
especially when those issues are

602
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:28,399
contrary to their economic incentives if

603
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:30,679
it's all about clicks we know from

604
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,469
internal leaks from Facebook and

605
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,200
elsewhere we know that they don't take

606
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,720
stuff down right away because it's click

607
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,320
click clicking away it is controversial

608
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,580
it is provocative and it is again

609
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,279
supporting their economic model I tend

610
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,320
to think that we need legislation for a

611
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,800
number of these areas I've felt for

612
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,450
time that extremist content on the

613
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,950
internet should have been taken down or

614
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,630
should have been made illegal the same

615
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,460
way that we made child pornography

616
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,350
illegal in the United States and again

617
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:08,110
some countries by the way are much more

618
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:11,570
agile at this than is the United States

619
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,389
what about in fact this concurrent issue

620
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:18,889
that arose just in the last 24 or 48

621
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:20,650
hours a very clearly altered video of

622
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,520
the Speaker of the House of

623
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:26,750
Representatives of the United States

624
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:29,900
which makes her appear drunk or ill or

625
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,550
something how do you distinguish that

626
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,230
and they were fused to take that down

627
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,139
although clearly it is disinformation

628
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:39,700
and the argument is well but then we'd

629
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,500
have to take down satirical videos or

630
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,170
political cartoons or who knows what so

631
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,100
where do you at this is the kind of

632
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:53,030
debate that should follow from all of

633
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,209
this it is very very profound because it

634
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,240
has a huge impact on our democratic

635
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,550
processes not the least of which are our

636
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,890
elections but it goes way beyond that to

637
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:08,510
influence the influence of society on

638
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:11,000
those who have been elected I understand

639
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,450
that Facebook actually is going to

640
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,430
create a Supreme Court type entity to

641
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,110
resolve these kind of issues but

642
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,660
presumably you'll have to have one for

643
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,419
the EU one for the US one for other

644
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,570
distinct markets you can see where this

645
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,460
is going and again the complexity that I

646
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,060
think you highlighted in your

647
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,270
discussions is really quite significant

648
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:38,270
again all of us I think have been aware

649
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:41,270
of this inside but that sort of hit us

650
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,460
in the middle of the face intellectually

651
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:46,420
and I think it spurs an awful lot of

652
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:49,790
very very good reflection and thought

653
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:55,990
all right thanks thanks a lot and thanks

654
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:58,460
for bringing in the the notion that that

655
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:03,410
undemocratic Nations have a clear

656
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:05,210
advantage in information operations

657
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,010
well they don't play by the rules

658
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,340
exactly there are such I mean there are

659
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:14,270
sort of normally accepted rules I think

660
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:21,470
albeit again countries do spy on each

661
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:25,190
other I am told I only know what I read

662
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:27,050
in the newspaper and facility terrible

663
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,090
when it was found reported according to

664
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,889
the newspaper that the United States was

665
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,070
actually eavesdropping on the Chancellor

666
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,920
of Germany I find that hard to believe

667
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:40,040
yeah embarrassingly so it was a offer of

668
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,110
a won war in 140 characters David but

669
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,050
Recaros was in telling actually last

670
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:49,010
weekend and we had a discussion ISM you

671
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,510
know we're in a literary festival where

672
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,320
he actually you know one of the things

673
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,790
he said that if the US would have a

674
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,899
operated at Ron farm somewhere in

675
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:01,639
Delaware influencing elections in our

676
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,920
country when pris would have known about

677
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,200
that in one week and you know next state

678
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,620
will be prosecuted taken down and so

679
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,840
forth

680
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,149
and of course we avail pass it is not

681
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,070
the case but I want to ask you booth one

682
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,840
question and we say is it not the case

683
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:21,679
it apparently was approved by funded by

684
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:26,060
and so forth so of course again by the

685
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,670
so called a criminal if a guy called

686
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:33,590
prigogine when asked about a following

687
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:35,840
question they NATO nations in five years

688
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,409
ago at the way summit declared what a

689
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,120
cyber attacks can lead to invocation of

690
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,330
a collective defense clause so that we

691
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,320
can actually go to war because of a

692
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:54,800
cyber attack could you and visit our

693
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:58,330
imagined a situation whereby we will go

694
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:02,360
to war because of a information warfare

695
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:07,040
that's right I mean I can imagine it you

696
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:11,810
can imagine a an attack that was clearly

697
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:16,100
attributed to an adversary that took

698
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:18,639
down the entire electrical grid of a

699
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:22,000
major country and caused

700
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,300
the effect that's an easy but so cyber

701
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,810
weapon of mass destruction I mean that's

702
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:31,510
I assume again this is very easy to make

703
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:33,129
this kind of declaration it's a little

704
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,750
bit more difficult when you get around

705
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,250
the the table and Brussels and start

706
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,840
discussing should we actually invoke

707
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,700
article 5 which as you know has only

708
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,750
been invoked one time in the wake of the

709
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:50,440
9/11 attacks information operation which

710
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,960
is actually the war I think I think the

711
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,470
the point here is is that under US

712
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,930
doctrine right now the term information

713
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,580
operations include cyber attack but in

714
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,650
in the way in which I've been trying to

715
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,340
talk about it here I've been using the

716
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,440
term Bill

717
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,918
I've been separating cyber attack and

718
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,380
information operations in in in a casual

719
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,629
in a casual way the problem is that the

720
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,610
terminology here is to is totally

721
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,130
muddled and I think you're the intent of

722
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,830
your question was in the information

723
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,800
operation sense of propaganda and and so

724
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,810
on can one imagine a invoking article

725
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,230
five and the aunt from my standpoint the

726
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:32,440
answer is no it was at a collection

727
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,918
infrastructure make by hacking voting

728
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,830
machines

729
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:37,540
perhaps I point out that this cyber

730
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,759
security and infrastructure security

731
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,909
agency in the United State does have

732
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,770
responsibility for cyber protection but

733
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,440
not for information operations in the

734
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,810
sense that I was a for propaganda for a

735
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,570
bad universe for misinformation on

736
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,860
Twitter and this information on on

737
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,780
Facebook and so on doesn't have

738
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,240
responsibility for that but nobody has

739
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,980
responsibility for that so in the sense

740
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,520
that you're talking that I understood

741
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:07,620
your question no impossible to imagine

742
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,620
that that NATO would invoke article 5

743
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,440
you're implying

744
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,530
again war I think everyone is

745
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,210
immediately leaping to the kinetic

746
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,190
definition of war that we're going to

747
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,400
start dropping bombs or we're going to

748
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:23,080
launch missiles or invade or something

749
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,740
like that there are lots and lots of

750
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:30,279
other options that exist short of that

751
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,470
even if you invoke article 5 and I think

752
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,480
the truth is that again this is an Arian

753
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,959
which we're doing what might be termed

754
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,940
intellectual low crawling we're sort of

755
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,060
its discovery learning no we're just we

756
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,770
don't know exactly we haven't thought

757
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,430
our way through all this stuff despite

758
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:50,859
all the debates we have not drawn clear

759
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:54,040
conclusions and I think we have also

760
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:56,619
learned that you should be very careful

761
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,660
of declaring red lines or these kinds of

762
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:03,940
very clear thresholds because if a red

763
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,779
line is crossed you'd really should have

764
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:10,599
to act on it and if you do not that

765
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:14,140
inaction sends shivers around the world

766
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:16,060
as to the credibility of the country or

767
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,040
organization that might have established

768
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,099
that red line or established the

769
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:24,220
threshold that was breached has happened

770
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:26,740
in August 2013 after a Syrian chemical

771
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:30,149
weapons radius we addressed and I can

772
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:34,930
tell you that as far away as Singapore

773
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:37,510
people pulled me aside and said you know

774
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,819
this has ramifications out here not just

775
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,510
in the Middle East and I would contend

776
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,640
that it may have had some ramifications

777
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:48,040
in Ukraine and some other places as well

778
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,740
so it's a very very significant issue

779
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:56,920
and I think policymakers would be very

780
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:59,200
wise to avoid very clear definitions or

781
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,480
very clear red lines because once

782
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,368
they're crossed something does have to

783
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,030
be done maybe just explain for the

784
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:09,010
public that in August 2012 President

785
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,230
Obama said that if chemical weapons

786
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,920
would be used against a population in

787
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:17,109
Syria he would reconsider a u.s.

788
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,170
position in you know using force in

789
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:22,839
Syria and then East Goethe in a I think

790
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:25,540
6th of August 2013 the chemical weapons

791
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:27,460
were used with a huge amount of

792
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,369
casualties when actually is another

793
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,640
Obama different but I want to open now

794
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:36,820
up to the audience we have 22 minutes

795
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,310
and 7 seconds and first goes to these

796
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,590
and even if everyone at stage know you

797
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,180
please identify yourself to

798
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,550
lissa past and I'm currently with a

799
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,500
McCain Institute for International

800
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:50,950
leadership and I'd like to take 90

801
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:54,340
minutes of the remaining 24 as likely

802
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:57,819
lever I did question one of the things

803
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:00,460
that you didn't really address much is

804
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:04,060
that our serial behavior in both

805
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:07,060
information and cyber operations and in

806
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,580
how similar that these in being agile

807
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,310
and integrated and opportunistic now

808
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,450
integrating cyber and information

809
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:18,310
operations law of economic warfare all

810
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:21,009
of that during peacetime

811
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:24,160
very similar in staying below the

812
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:27,640
threshold of armed attack and very

813
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,779
simulating that all and any tools and

814
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,359
targets are legitimate so knowing what

815
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,060
we know about adversarial strategy and

816
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,880
in how flexible and light rail it is how

817
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,360
can we as rule of law based nations that

818
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,800
have very clear change of command which

819
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,730
democracy takes time and deliberation

820
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
takes time

821
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:51,130
how do we manage risks in a way that's

822
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,610
as a child and as flexible as the

823
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,780
adversary to clear these so basically

824
00:38:54,610 --> 00:39:02,200
how to respond to a full spectrum

825
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:06,540
warfare but my answer to that question

826
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:09,669
is is that one of the fundamental

827
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,170
guiding principles of certainly the

828
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,020
United States and most democracies I

829
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:19,450
think is a clear distinction between

830
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:21,730
quote war and quote peace and and this

831
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:24,819
is an environment in which there are no

832
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,080
non-combatants especially information

833
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,100
with what I'm talking about is

834
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,799
information operations information

835
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,360
warfare if you will there are no

836
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,200
non-combatants in that there's a

837
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:40,600
constant battle going on all the time

838
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:42,430
and the entire I'm most familiar with

839
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,440
the US government the entire structure

840
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,180
of the US government is oriented around

841
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,630
the distinction between peace and war

842
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:52,480
and and it doesn't do very well in this

843
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,420
grit in in this gray zone whereas the

844
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,130
adversaries that it's not it's not as

845
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,230
dental in my view that the you know

846
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:02,019
there that that Russia and China are

847
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,779
authoritarian States and they can do

848
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:07,629
things in in the space that that that we

849
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:09,730
can't so I don't know how to I don't

850
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,369
know how to deal with it but that that's

851
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:16,059
to me the the fundamental problem is how

852
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:18,849
you transform to a semi war footing in

853
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:20,920
an intermediate stage you know where

854
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,019
there's conflict all the time and I

855
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,890
don't know how to deal with that dude I

856
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:29,200
I think what you have is a comprehensive

857
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,940
toolbox all the time by the way as a

858
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,460
member of the board of the McCain

859
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:39,519
Institute I congratulate you on your

860
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:42,039
affiliation look I think that what

861
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,660
you've laid out again is very

862
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,250
hypothetical and I have to give a very

863
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,609
hypothetical answer because there's no

864
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,400
specific to it but you saw us do this

865
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:54,788
actually in the run-up to the 2018

866
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,890
elections where there was a decision

867
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:59,680
that the risk was too high at the

868
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:02,558
eleventh hour that Russian activity

869
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,660
could put a finger on the scales of the

870
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,109
election or disrupt them in some fashion

871
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,149
and so all of a sudden we used the

872
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:12,369
capabilities that we had and by the way

873
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,019
on the title 10 side I'm pretty certain

874
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,089
because obviously we talked about it

875
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:18,788
afterwards which you wouldn't do if it

876
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:23,200
was on the title 50 side the covert

877
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:25,450
action side and we risk exposing our

878
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,430
capabilities and potentially some

879
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:31,779
sources and other tools that we had and

880
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,299
that was a case you're just constantly

881
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:38,730
doing risk mitigation now we have also

882
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:43,299
subsequently subsequent to the 2016

883
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:48,009
elections had a variety of punitive

884
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:52,150
trade or economic sanctions imposed we

885
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:54,609
have used the legal tools and actually I

886
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,740
think indicted or preferred charges

887
00:41:54,609 --> 00:42:00,339
against some of the individuals who were

888
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:04,720
involved it's going to dramatically

889
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:06,009
reduce their ability to go to many of

890
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,339
the countries with whom we have

891
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:11,100
extradition agreements

892
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:15,390
and and and on and on and on and and we

893
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:17,940
named and shamed and etc so by the way I

894
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,250
should nothing should be taken to infer

895
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,530
that I am anything but one who agrees

896
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,420
with Winston Churchill that democracy is

897
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,150
the worst form of government except for

898
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,640
all the others and I very much want to

899
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:33,120
live where I live I feel very fortunate

900
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,980
to have grown up in a democracy but I do

901
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,370
think we have to recognize that there

902
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:42,120
are some sort of unique vulnerabilities

903
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:44,370
because of our system I do think that

904
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,200
again we can react to these but again

905
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,600
I've been around the situation room

906
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,910
table in the West Wing of the White

907
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,790
House as we debated this kind of stuff

908
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,890
and it usually has to be fairly

909
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:59,070
significant before we're going to do

910
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:01,529
something that is visible by the way

911
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,570
keep in mind there are other less

912
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:06,030
visible or invisible activities

913
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,840
hopefully they stay invisible they don't

914
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,700
always but in the covert action toolbox

915
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,150
there's an awful lot that can be done as

916
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:17,220
well and as you think about what you are

917
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,170
trying to do sometimes what you want to

918
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,680
dream up is something diabolically

919
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:24,930
clever that they may not know who did it

920
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,850
they know something happened they don't

921
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,649
know precisely who did it they may think

922
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,480
we did it but they don't actually want

923
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,140
to acknowledge that they know that we

924
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,510
did it and we're happy not to have them

925
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:39,839
publicly say that but there is an effect

926
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:42,420
there as well like a former CIA director

927
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,420
well you know if you think about how do

928
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,080
you respond right now for example to

929
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,880
Iran it would be irresponsible if people

930
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,590
weren't thinking of that kind of

931
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:59,460
response as well as the again obvious

932
00:43:54,590 --> 00:44:02,220
kinetic or very overt activities very

933
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,140
gentlemen you have been both speaking

934
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,259
about the vulnerabilities of direct

935
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,200
democratic societies but very say of

936
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,900
course there a number of strengths and

937
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,839
one is of course a very important

938
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,480
regulatory power what democracy sir

939
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,660
because of a huge markets in North

940
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,750
America in Europe in Japan South Korea

941
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:29,578
Australian so forth and and David you

942
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:33,410
were alluding to when need to legislate

943
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:36,569
to regulate away social media platforms

944
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,910
her venue had your last slide on in

945
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:41,460
terms of protection measures you

946
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:47,819
actually had as one I think the first

947
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:49,740
line was use less social media I don't

948
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:53,220
think this is necessarily going to be

949
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:58,288
the case let's try and if you agree with

950
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:00,660
that what would be the avenue for you to

951
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:03,210
approach actually regulating the social

952
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,640
media platforms do we should we consider

953
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:09,869
them to be as utilities should we

954
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:13,920
consider them as publishers what would

955
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:16,140
be the way so how do you regulate the

956
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,890
social media platforms this is in this

957
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:22,680
is an interesting question I'm struck

958
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:25,078
but in that context I'm struck by what

959
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,149
the general mentioned the about

960
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,410
pornography and the more I studied this

961
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,260
information the more I think it

962
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,980
resembles pornography which is I know it

963
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,960
when I see it

964
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,329
now those aren't my words those are the

965
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,740
words of a Supreme Court justice who

966
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:38,970
struggled and struggled and struggle and

967
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,098
struggle and struggle to define

968
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,779
pornography and the conclusion was I

969
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,359
know I don't can't define it but I know

970
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:47,819
when I see it that's a terrible

971
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,980
definition to have legally right but

972
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:51,599
this is a Supreme Court justice

973
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,059
especially terrible if you are having

974
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,010
machines try to identify this is the

975
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,140
problem that's right child pornography

976
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:02,160
actually machines have been able to

977
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:04,950
overtime reasonably well identify that

978
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,129
it's much more difficult when you get

979
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:10,259
into X hate speech extremist speech

980
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:13,920
where is the line that it crosses the

981
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,569
incitement to violence but and but the

982
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,910
social media platforms have done

983
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:20,130
miserably at that it took public outcry

984
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:24,240
from some very good private

985
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:27,450
organizations to get anwar alwaki videos

986
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,089
taken off of YouTube by and large they

987
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,399
were more available two years ago I

988
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:34,109
think it was then they were when he was

989
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,520
actually alive keep in mind he was

990
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:38,040
killed in September of two

991
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,870
2011 and Yemen having been judged to be

992
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,529
the most dangerous man in the world at

993
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,200
the time

994
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:46,110
along with his sidekick who was the

995
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,839
editor of inspire magazine at the time

996
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:51,150
and again the problem I do again have

997
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,120
some sympathy certainly or understanding

998
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:56,730
for the social media platforms on this

999
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,770
except that I think they can do so much

1000
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,080
much better again if these private

1001
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,850
organizations could find this stuff why

1002
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,279
could they not with their tens of

1003
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:07,560
thousands of and and in fact they they

1004
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,530
are not government agencies and so they

1005
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,900
in fact can take down whatever they want

1006
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,300
yeah uh in you know without violating

1007
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,130
First Amendment rights and and so on so

1008
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,020
that that's absolutely right the problem

1009
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,000
is this that not in their economic

1010
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,610
incentive to do so they don't have the

1011
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,070
meat they have the physical means to do

1012
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,540
it but they don't want to do it and they

1013
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,180
say we don't want to get into the

1014
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:35,100
business of content enjoy of arbitrating

1015
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:38,129
truth well why not the reason is that

1016
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,990
they will piss off a lot of people for

1017
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,340
every decision that they make and they

1018
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,629
don't want to endure the kind of

1019
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,300
controversy because it'll hurt their

1020
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,610
bottom line and so on you know those are

1021
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,530
the kinds of issues that you face and

1022
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,690
you know sort of the idea of a Supreme

1023
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,760
Court that there how long does the

1024
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,640
supreme court take to render decisions I

1025
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,950
mean that's you're gonna get into the

1026
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,990
ones Eden's in enthusiasts where you

1027
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,270
have to really be making millions of

1028
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:06,689
decisions or in a short amount of time

1029
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,270
and and and so there has to be a better

1030
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:12,690
way to do this or I'm praying that there

1031
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:15,180
is I do not know okay there is there has

1032
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,850
to be a will to implement it the

1033
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,799
Christchurch attacks being visible for

1034
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:22,980
so long on a variety of different social

1035
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,500
media platforms as arguably in quotes

1036
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,090
criminal so again that has to be done

1037
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,140
there better by the way when you think

1038
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:33,300
about the strengths of democracies and

1039
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,660
countries with the rule of law it's very

1040
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,780
interesting to reflect that oftentimes

1041
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:43,290
the corrupt political figures that

1042
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:46,970
corrupt the major criminal enterprise

1043
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:49,810
leaders seek to invest their money in

1044
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,430
democracies with the rule of law

1045
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,020
because they don't want to invest it in

1046
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,970
their own place they know how corrupt

1047
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:00,660
and criminal it is and it may not be

1048
00:48:54,970 --> 00:49:00,660
preserved one of the paradoxes of life

1049
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,830
let's go for more questions in the

1050
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,140
audience I see someone in back there oh

1051
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,330
yeah yes okay let's see let's take

1052
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:14,830
gentleman in the middle and then to

1053
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:18,640
extreme back Brad Bigelow from shape and

1054
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:22,420
I have a comment and a question a couple

1055
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,799
of years ago we had a US analyst from

1056
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,110
the intelligence community with

1057
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,420
specialists in cyberspace Chinese

1058
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,550
cyberspace operations and information

1059
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,230
operations come and give us a

1060
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:36,250
presentation about techniques tactics

1061
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:38,410
etc etc and at the end I said well this

1062
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,200
is great but exactly your question what

1063
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:43,390
do we as democracies operating on the

1064
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:48,220
rule of law how do we respond to that

1065
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:50,580
and I keep his response to that question

1066
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,230
with me at all times when I think about

1067
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:56,770
what's going on here right now which is

1068
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:59,910
and his response was every time that

1069
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:04,870
Russia or China or North Korea or Iran

1070
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:08,560
sees 17 different NATO nations come

1071
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:11,730
together for military exercise sees 29

1072
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:16,299
flags meeting together to take decisions

1073
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:19,420
as a consensus body you at least cause

1074
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,250
them a moment's pause to say wait a

1075
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,470
minute what are the odds I'm really

1076
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,290
facing here because you can imbalance a

1077
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:31,209
situation but a long term conflict the

1078
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:34,060
numbers are against them my question is

1079
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,980
we're doing that we have decades of

1080
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,740
experience of cooperation and

1081
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,270
conventional and and other forces and

1082
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,640
capability development and there

1083
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:44,320
pterence mechanisms we're starting to do

1084
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,750
that through this conference and other

1085
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,470
venues to to develop that in cyberspace

1086
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:53,910
is there an equivalent for information

1087
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:56,230
operations that we need to be exploring

1088
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:59,020
right so let me actually start on that

1089
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,270
because I've recently done a monograph

1090
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,880
on an American foreign policy that was

1091
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:06,130
titled

1092
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,930
coherence and comprehensiveness : and

1093
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:11,559
American foreign policy imperative in

1094
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:14,618
specifically frankly with respect to

1095
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:16,719
China the us-china relationship

1096
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:18,549
obviously the most important in the

1097
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,349
world by far perhaps more important than

1098
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:23,979
all of the others put together at this

1099
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:25,839
point in time how it is resolved and I'm

1100
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:28,808
one who hopes that it can be mutually

1101
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:32,469
beneficial that it can does not have to

1102
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:35,920
become more conflictual than it is at

1103
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:37,989
present keeping in mind that the unique

1104
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,369
aspect of this particular competition

1105
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:42,789
because obviously there are very

1106
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:44,920
significant competitive elements the

1107
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:46,930
unique aspect is that we're also each

1108
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,910
other's among each other's biggest

1109
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,979
trading partner something that certainly

1110
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:54,160
didn't exist in the days of the Cold War

1111
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:57,308
when we did very very little exporting

1112
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:01,089
or importing to and from the Soviet

1113
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:03,940
Union and what I'm getting at here is

1114
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:07,390
the comprehensive approach to this means

1115
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:11,589
you employ all tools and so if you are

1116
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:13,509
concerned about as we have been and

1117
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:16,719
continued to be about theft of

1118
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:18,940
intellectual property through cyberspace

1119
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,549
you've got to employ all the tools and

1120
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:24,789
it's taken us a long time to get to that

1121
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:26,680
that you had President Obama confront

1122
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:30,160
President Xi at the sunnylands summit

1123
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,859
some years back after quite a

1124
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,078
significant diplomatic engagement the

1125
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:36,848
Chinese actually responded and the PLA

1126
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:38,710
theft of intellectual property in

1127
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:42,099
cyberspace did actually go down

1128
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:44,529
demonstrably until it started to go back

1129
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:46,089
up and more by the MSS the Ministry of

1130
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:49,390
State Security than the People's

1131
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:51,308
Liberation Army their version of NSA and

1132
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,078
so again we've got to muster all of

1133
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:56,999
these comprehensive tools but the

1134
00:52:53,079 --> 00:53:00,160
coherent component implies that

1135
00:52:56,999 --> 00:53:03,249
everything you do around the world has

1136
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,859
to be examined through a prism that asks

1137
00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:09,308
what will the effect of this be on the

1138
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:11,739
us-china relationship and on the policy

1139
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:13,569
on China from a u.s. perspective which

1140
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:16,239
has to be together with all of our

1141
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:16,520
allies and partners and so you then have

1142
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:21,170
to

1143
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:23,270
ask weather how about the value of

1144
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,030
partners the value of allies in

1145
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:28,700
particular the values of a coherent

1146
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:32,630
approach rather than one that is

1147
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:35,480
disrupted by perhaps overstressing

1148
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:39,920
of the inadequacy of spending on as a

1149
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,750
percent of GDP on defense or trade

1150
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,080
issues and the rest not that those are

1151
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,430
not legitimate issues don't get me wrong

1152
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,350
but if you're going to have a coherent

1153
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:51,049
approach and it's going to be

1154
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,589
comprehensive on top of that you've

1155
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:57,020
constantly got to ask what your actions

1156
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:59,990
at the g7 summit or a NATO summit or

1157
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,060
other the bilateral and Alliance

1158
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,919
relationships how important that is

1159
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:07,850
because you put your finger on something

1160
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,730
and that is the the power of many and

1161
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:12,740
the fact is that that some of our most

1162
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:19,460
important adversaries right now cannot

1163
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:23,689
count true allies for them at all and in

1164
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:27,650
many cases are inspiring others to to

1165
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:30,770
actually balance against them by

1166
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:34,100
resorting it by again being parts of

1167
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:35,600
alliances and partners and that is

1168
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,029
crucially important and that is

1169
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,210
something that my own country very much

1170
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:43,520
needs to reflect on I think because it

1171
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:46,490
has to be done together and you can't

1172
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,470
disrupt that even if you have legitimate

1173
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:52,089
issues and I've heard many more than the

1174
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:54,259
current president complain to NATO

1175
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:59,510
partners about the inadequacies of

1176
00:54:54,260 --> 00:55:02,180
defence spending I think here yes Katie

1177
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:05,630
still are you still on track of having

1178
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:08,299
attended every cycle over once been all

1179
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,580
that one ah Mr Bond all right here is

1180
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,840
care Giles from Chatham House General

1181
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,060
Petraeus pointed out that the

1182
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,490
information challenges were facing the

1183
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,380
herb laid out a uniquely challenging to

1184
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:20,089
democracies but then there's another

1185
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,490
thing which is unique to democracies

1186
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:25,280
which is the implied premise of this

1187
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:27,529
talk of this panel that cyber operations

1188
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,540
are separate from information operations

1189
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,610
or can be contrasted with them

1190
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,440
all of our adversaries are surprising

1191
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,780
you'll anonymous that it is a single

1192
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,910
indivisible whole and that dividing

1193
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,800
cyber officer is an entirely artificial

1194
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,930
construct so my question and I'd like to

1195
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,380
hear from both panelists if possible is

1196
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:47,960
that a self-inflicted conceptual injury

1197
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:50,450
which constrains our responses the fact

1198
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,910
that we see this division between cyber

1199
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:54,620
and information given that it's

1200
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,350
historically led to this situation that

1201
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,819
hurdle in described where we have

1202
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:01,520
agencies to protect us in terms of cyber

1203
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:03,860
security but none to protect us up until

1204
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,690
now in terms of information security do

1205
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,490
you recognize that as a problem and if

1206
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:15,200
so what would you ideally like to do

1207
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:20,540
about it very subtly I'm I have to say

1208
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:24,009
that I worry a lot about government

1209
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:26,690
action to control the information space

1210
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,610
the information environment which in the

1211
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:32,270
same way in which we the United States

1212
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:34,730
would like to control cyberspace it's

1213
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,440
very clear that that's what we want that

1214
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,210
we would like to try to do that in

1215
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,670
cyberspace that's part of declared us

1216
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,290
doctrine and as I was if the US

1217
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:44,240
government came out with a similar

1218
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:48,830
comment about the information space I

1219
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:52,970
would be terrified about that and you

1220
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:55,220
know as authoritarian governments have

1221
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:59,000
tendencies towards restricting in you

1222
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:02,689
know good information what I would call

1223
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,340
the good information to the public to

1224
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,130
the extent that one believes that there

1225
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:10,070
are authoritarian tendencies in certain

1226
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:13,160
leaders of certain nations on in the

1227
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:16,820
West there there might be some concerns

1228
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:20,569
about that kind of information control

1229
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:23,090
so you know I I accept your premise that

1230
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,290
the that there's some integration you

1231
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,390
know that the adversaries have an

1232
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,670
advantage of integration whether we

1233
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:31,609
should go in that direction is is a very

1234
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:33,710
much a value Laden question I'm worried

1235
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:37,760
about going there I don't know where I

1236
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:40,220
come out on it frankly because we in the

1237
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,450
United States we have a very if you

1238
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:45,270
contrast all the nations in

1239
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,828
in the world on free speech and so on

1240
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:48,839
the u.s. is really at one end of a pole

1241
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:52,349
yeah you know one end of a spectrum

1242
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:54,630
right and other nations are you know

1243
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:56,579
sort of go farther away from that I

1244
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,500
don't know how much farther away I want

1245
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:00,569
to go on you know front from the first

1246
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,490
men it's that you know I'm an American I

1247
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:04,140
really value the First Amendment but

1248
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,240
there are some it's not there that

1249
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:10,259
consistent with the sort of world that

1250
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,899
you're talking about I am I'm not as

1251
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,670
concerned about that well I am concerned

1252
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,220
about again how do you define First

1253
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:20,760
Amendment rights and I cherish those as

1254
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:24,058
any I think most Americans do it's more

1255
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,640
again coming to grips with what should

1256
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:31,010
the responsibilities be of those who are

1257
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,839
presenting these ideas in a world where

1258
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:35,819
you no longer have the trusted three

1259
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,500
Network nightly news which are all

1260
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:39,390
trying to be as objective as they

1261
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,210
possibly can but you have some that are

1262
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:45,058
absolutely very clearly in one side of

1263
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:47,160
the camp or one side of the debate and

1264
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:51,049
then another it's on the other side and

1265
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:54,990
then now others that are just pervane

1266
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:57,329
again what is essentially a niche to

1267
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:59,578
which some people can retreat and I

1268
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:01,349
think it's again how do we as a society

1269
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,329
come to grips with that how does

1270
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:07,400
government come to grips with that how

1271
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:09,750
do again the very powerful social media

1272
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,809
platforms and Internet service providers

1273
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:14,549
come to grips with that and so forth

1274
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:16,230
they're also there are some definitional

1275
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:18,960
issues in here as well which the

1276
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:21,059
military will be more familiar with in

1277
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,040
which the US and particularly us

1278
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:25,589
militarily the US Army is sort of tied

1279
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,029
itself in knots over about you know

1280
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:29,910
where what is IO

1281
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:32,099
does it include cyber or not as it were

1282
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:34,460
psychological operations except we can't

1283
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:37,319
call it that anymore we call it military

1284
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,790
information support operations and these

1285
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:41,099
kinds of things which actually can

1286
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:43,619
consume an awful lot of organizational

1287
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:46,710
energy as you're trying to sort out

1288
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:48,450
again your sort of conceptual

1289
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:51,030
architecture and then actually the

1290
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:53,430
organizational architecture of who has

1291
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:56,190
authority gives orders about this or

1292
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:59,160
that there's is some of that sir

1293
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:01,680
in government again as you point out

1294
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,569
there actually is a gap in government

1295
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,060
just as there was a glaring gap before

1296
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:08,579
we had a cyber security and

1297
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,259
infrastructure security agency yes there

1298
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:12,030
was an office and DHS Department

1299
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,640
Homeland Security which had that but it

1300
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:17,150
was wholly inadequate to the task given

1301
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,359
the concerns that we should have about

1302
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:23,640
the you know very very low likelihood of

1303
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,828
a cyber weapon of mass destruction but

1304
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,680
not the impossible likelihood of that

1305
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:33,079
and we should have been much more agile

1306
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:35,819
in developing that kind of organization

1307
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:38,550
so again this this comes back to again

1308
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:40,980
the society it comes right back to what

1309
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:44,579
I guess my original commentary on your

1310
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:47,040
again very thought-provoking set of

1311
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,650
slides is that we've got to have some

1312
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,170
pretty big debates

1313
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:54,319
somebody's got to guide those debates

1314
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,760
civil society organizations and so forth

1315
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:00,480
government has to distill some of that

1316
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,240
and if anyone saw the hearings with the

1317
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,910
Facebook founder especially of the US

1318
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,759
Senate he realized that the baseline

1319
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:13,250
knowledge is not in all cases at the

1320
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:15,180
highest of levels to inform the kinds of

1321
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,670
legislation so again there's gonna have

1322
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:19,169
to be some assistance even in that

1323
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,810
regard there's somebody in the room here

1324
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:24,660
I won't identify by name but is moving

1325
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:28,140
from one major tech organization to

1326
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:31,259
major social media platform and we were

1327
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:34,230
talking earlier about how they might

1328
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,730
actually help in that all of this and I

1329
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:37,260
actually think they ought to be among

1330
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,260
the ones who are helping to craft

1331
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,510
legislation to come to grips with the

1332
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,349
issues that have now surfaced even if

1333
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:48,810
those are contrary to their economic

1334
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:50,579
incentives and and the sheer

1335
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,529
money-making capacity of those

1336
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:55,280
organizations because if they don't do

1337
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:58,530
that I think they're going to undermine

1338
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,300
the they're going to strangle their or

1339
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,730
at least constrict the goose that is

1340
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,069
laying the golden egg you know in the

1341
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,960
financial world we often say that we

1342
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:08,640
want to do well obviously if you don't

1343
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,359
do well people aren't going to continue

1344
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,950
to invest there

1345
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,170
with you but you want to do that while

1346
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:14,879
doing good and you do that not only

1347
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,680
because it's the right thing to do and

1348
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,279
that should be enough but if you don't

1349
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,558
accept that

1350
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:21,930
it's the smart thing to do because if

1351
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,880
you don't do good long enough eventually

1352
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,680
you're not going to do well and I hope

1353
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,619
that that could be the conclusion that

1354
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,960
is reached after so many of the

1355
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:35,039
exposures of the inadequacies and the

1356
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,589
inadequate responses again by the senior

1357
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,839
leaders of these large organizations all

1358
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:45,150
right unfortunately we have run out of

1359
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:48,299
time already over time unless you have

1360
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:52,019
something to say for as a closing

1361
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:53,920
remarks please sorry gentlemen please

1362
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:57,788
give a round of applause

1363
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,789
[Applause]
