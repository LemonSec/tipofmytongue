1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,979
all right thanks Andy a fantastic event

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,050
oh it's not there anymore psych on us

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,170
I had a chance to go there in last

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,269
November a great conference and Andy

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,910
sorry for the rough sequencing here

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,820
honestly it wasn't intentional please

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,960
don't do it to me and you know play at

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,630
least let me know beforehand but yeah

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,179
well I had some notes but those are

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,070
those of you who know 80s movies well

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,589
you you know that after or after the

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,510
silly comes ridiculous totally

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,950
ridiculous and then there is only only

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,500
one speed left that's right that's

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,270
ludicrous

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,940
Spaceballs you haven't seen it yeah okay

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,039
there's stuff so I was I was afraid if

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,410
Andy kicks a ludicrous well I got

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,170
nothing left but no no it's it's all

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,398
mine so I got a do it Wow

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:00,000
but what a conference what a saikhan ah

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,649
now I know that the last speaker has the

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,459
expectation of summarize what's been

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:10,530
said so last night after you left the

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:12,809
party I started reading yeah and I must

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,810
have a misprint copy because I got to

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,170
the end there was no executive summary

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,729
wasn't there so I you all got this thing

29
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,090
but uh I think I'm gonna go with the

30
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,759
president summary knowing her work

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,820
ethics and and capacity she probably

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,310
read it before coming here so what she

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,309
said on Wednesday pretty much sums it up

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,689
it's not a direct quote now but I'm

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,680
incorporating it into into my in my

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,889
thoughts that the four days of workshops

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,259
keynotes

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,270
panels and then the site discussions at

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,880
the coffee breaks at the Icebreaker

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,920
on the beach last night perhaps

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,210
someplace after the beach I don't even

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,210
know because I was reading the book

43
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,490
there was some battle in there it

44
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,380
definitely was not silent that's what

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,840
the president said right don't be silent

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:13,470
on cyber so that's the summary now Wow

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,640
you the audience we we do Sai Khan's

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,440
because of you and for you it's it's so

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,130
cool to see that there is so many of you

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,410
here still it's that's the last day last

51
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,780
night on a speech that nobody could hear

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,180
because of sound I was making parallels

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,960
with marathon I used to run them before

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,210
I had kids so I ran my last one five

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,410
years and seven months ago one month

56
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,570
before my son was born so I said in my

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,720
speech last night that you know if you

58
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,579
go to marathon and you stop at 35 K goes

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,080
there is a cool drinking station and you

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,410
know people who talk too and you don't

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,040
go to the finish then you haven't really

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,310
been there or done it so you are now on

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,250
the final stretch 42 K is done all the

64
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:07,370
rest 198 meters that's me so you're

65
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,690
you're almost there congratulations and

66
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,540
thank you for being here once again you

67
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:17,640
the speakers when I when I came to this

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,070
job nine months ago I was told about the

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,839
call for papers process and I thought it

70
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,310
was too rigorous too too rough but I

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,340
decided in my first year I'm not gonna

72
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,400
change big things the big traditions and

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,100
now I learned that the this is this is

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,160
the thing that sets Ikon apart

75
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,500
in my nine months I've been avoiding

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,870
travelling as much as I can but I've

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,550
still been to a few conferences and I

78
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,850
need to be careful with the words now

79
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,670
because I was I was really positively

80
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,450
cyber tamed by by Jessica and by Luke

81
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,059
here but in my last nine months The

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,238
Verge cyber Tyner had a negative context

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,760
Omegas I've seen people that go from

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,580
conference to conference and just fairly

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,230
unprepared go do their thing and go next

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,590
and I don't know if they they sometimes

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,738
have job you all do all the speakers at

88

most of them you have seen pillar in and

115
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,640

managers the logistical people support

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,789
the program committee you don't even

118
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,890
know who they are probably so it's been

119
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,760
a true team effort but we're building on

120
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,710
a legacy of 10 previous icons so I want

121
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,690
to thank all the previous directors and

122
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,820
their teams I've seen everyone besides

123

they're all here but and I'm going to

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
counter all in there as well even though

126
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,520
officially wasn't the director but but

127
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,390
still Ron Rick's oh so Raoul little more

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,430
towards Len Marla thank you so much for

129
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,979
your efforts and your team efforts your

130
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,010
team's efforts that you did through to

131
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,470
the last ten years I want to thank our

132
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:14,580
sponsors that was great entertainment

133
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,780
look it was was good we as I said on

134
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,050
Wednesday we couldn't do this without

135
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,640
without the sponsors being being a

136
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,190
governmental organization non non

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,640
commercial conference then there is only

138
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,870
one thing left and that would be the

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,450
theme for the next year's conference

140
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,320
there is a tradition it's announced as

141
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:40,650
the last thing the tradition is also

142
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:43,469
that it's short they enough to provide

143
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,679
generic guidance but not to restrict us

144
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,990
from talking next year the hot issues

145
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,360
that we might not even be aware of today

146
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:58,620
as we thought of the theme so the theme

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:01,980
for psych on 2020 is 20/20 vision the

148
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,660
next decade now I suppose you could have

149
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:10,130
this team any year we decided to have it

150
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:11,910
next year some reasons I know now that

151
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,680
recommendation came from a European

152
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,420
staff member but I know now the audience

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
is split the Americans know exactly what

154
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,190
20/20 vision means and the Europeans

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,250
might not let me try to explain if if

156
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:26,760
your eyes are like mine that Wednesday

157
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,800
you know you didn't know to properly

158
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,110
remove your stage makeup and went to bed

159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,050
and your eyes have been watery and then

160
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,670
kind of blurry last two days you don't

161
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,430
see it then you don't have 20/20 vision

162
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:41,760
that 20/20 means perfect vision and in

163
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,770
American medical terms now to go into

164
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,630
