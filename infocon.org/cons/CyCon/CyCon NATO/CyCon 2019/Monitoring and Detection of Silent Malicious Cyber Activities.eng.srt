1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
so thank you very much and thank you for

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,600
having me here at saikhan as a speaker

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,570
it's always a pleasure to come back to

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,879
Tallinn and participate in a conference

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,070
that is so well organized so my

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,560
presentation will be about monitoring

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,779
the dark web for cybersecurity

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,580
information which is work research we

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,070
have been doing in Switzerland

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,560
otama Swiss with some collaborators

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,990
which unfortunately are not all here

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,970
except Maarten stroma which is also here

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,830
in this room and is certainly happy to

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,610
take questions also later on in the

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,059
break so the the dark web is a

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,730
conglomerate of services which are not

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,870
directly accessible by search engines

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,890
and also by regular users the dark web

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,280
is mostly used by criminals to exchange

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:57,899
illegal goods so for example to exchange

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:03,270
illegal pornography to exchange weapons

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:07,830
or to sell drugs but the dark web is

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,049
also used quite commonly by hackers and

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,658
by cyber criminals to exchange

25
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,479
information and trade the information in

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,650
the area of cyber security so in the

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,549
dark web you will find a lot of

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,110
information about vulnerabilities

29
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,750
software vulnerabilities exploits how to

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,460
exploit those vulnerabilities and you

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,610
will also find information about data

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:35,579
breaches so there I'm sure in this room

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:38,039
many of you somehow the password of one

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,130
of their online services that are traded

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,939
in in the dark web so these passwords

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,939
are traded there there is also botnets

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,990
for hire so services that can be hired

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,689
and rented to launch for example a

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,979
distributed denial of service attacks so

40
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,889
it's certainly an interesting source

41
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,110
also for the attackers but the question

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,420
in this research is to see how we could

43
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,670
exploit this source of information for

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,920
cyber defence to protect ourselves so if

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,818
we manage to observe what's going on

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,649
there

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,738
we may have also

48
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,670
an advantage at improving our cyber

49
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,730
defense capabilities so in the

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,958
literature you find different

51
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,929
definitions of the dark web in the Deep

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,930
Web so the these words often used

53
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,930
interchangeably so in this work we use a

54
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,440
definition which is as follows the Deep

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,569
Web for us is basically the part a

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,180
subset of the world wide web that is not

57
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,589
accessible by search engines but that

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,410
you can access with the regular web

59
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,280
browser over the HTTP protocol and then

60
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,750
the dark web is basically also a subset

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,090
of the web that is not accessible by

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,040
search engines but there you need

63
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:59,099
specialized tools and software to access

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,590
the the dark net over an anonymity

65
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,149
network so to access this anonymity

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,120
network there are a couple of

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:12,959
technologies around but the most famous

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:17,670
technology is tor so the Tor project is

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,370
a network of crowd-sourced tor routers

70
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,179
that I used to build an anonymity

71
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:28,139
Network which provides p2p anonymity

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,910
between clients and servers in a sense

73
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,450
you can as a client you can connect it

74
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,670
all you will open up a virtual circuit

75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,738
of Tor really nodes and this allows you

76
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,349
to access the regular web but also to

77
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,419
access store hidden services so these

78
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,619
services are basically only accessible

79
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,450
to tall and as a client you cannot see

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,099
the IP address and you don't know where

81
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,349
the servers are and on the other side

82
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,730
the server doesn't know who is accessing

83
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:59,660
what is the IP address of the client so

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,518
there's been a study in 2016 to look at

85
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,959
the size and how many hidden services

86
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,540
there are around so they found that

87
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,150
there are around 30,000 hidden services

88
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,168
that are available that were available

89
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,880
by then through TRO so in a sense the

90
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,310
document is relatively small if you

91
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,060
compare this to the surface web which

92
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,820
has a billion sites so it's a relatively

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,920
small small Network

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,130
so the Desai's is not the challenge in

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,290
monitoring the dark web but there are

96
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,900
still significant challenges that arise

97
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,640
if you want to systematically analyze

98
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,859
and understand what's going on there

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,099
so here have summarized the four main

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,720
challenges that we have been addressing

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,510
so the first challenge is that there is

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,520
a quite a high service dynamics so if

103
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,909
you go in the in the dark web you will

104
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,609
realize that a lot of links and the

105
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,500
services disappear after a while so

106
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,420
after a couple of months you will see

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,910
and we discover this also that half of

108
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,290
the services that were available at the

109
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,060
beginning they they are no longer

110
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,710
available and this can mean that they

111
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,070
are basically closed

112
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,200
because of some legal reasons or or

113
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,860
because they're just moving around to

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,260
another link so despite its dynamics

115
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,780
there's also the issue that the dark web

116
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,210
is not well interconnected hyperlinked

117
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,030
so if you look at the surface web it's

118
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,520
really a network and when you want to

119
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,400
monitor you can have any entry point and

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,159
you can traverse this graph and you will

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,560
be able to find a lot of other sides

122
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,470
whereas the dark web is more a set of

123
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,610
isolated silos so there is a study

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:44,480
showing that 87% of the sites actually

125
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:47,300
do not link to other dark web sites so

126
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,750
it's more challenging to discover the

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,540
services and to have some monitoring in

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,660
such an environment also there is the

129
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,000
issue of languages whereas in English is

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,300
the main language for the standard

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,060
language for security in in the

132
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,280
classical web in the dark web people use

133
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,290
a lot their local languages so you will

134
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,690
find the prominent language which is

135
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,730
Russian but also English in other

136
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,740
languages there are used quite commonly

137
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,410
so if you want to monitor the dark web

138
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,200
you will will need also to cope with the

139
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,820
different languages and then finally

140
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,050
last but not least there is the issue

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,030
that the day a lot of data is

142
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,280
unstructured it's a lot of data in the

143
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,900
dark web is found in forums in an

144
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,090
unstructured way so people just post

145
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,489
something and then have there are some

146
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,989
information in instant text and it's all

147
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,630
distributed so

148
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,520
having a monitoring of such distributed

149
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:45,710
unstructured data is also quite a

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,960
challenge so in this project we set the

151
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,930
objective to be the system that we call

152
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,318
Black Widow and the goal is to provide a

153
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,099
user interface for cyber expert cyber

154
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,380
analysts to capture the dark web dynamic

155
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,940
in real time what is really important

156
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,400
here is to be able to find information

157
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,940
quickly because the darknet is typically

158
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,919
the place where hackers and data leaks

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,630
are traded in the first place later on

160
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,539
they may appear also in the surface web

161
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,949
but at first they are always up most of

162
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,840
the time they appear in the dark web so

163
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,940
it's important to have something that is

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,460
relatively in real tile and in real time

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,370
in order to detect if some company

166
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,409
enterprises for example leaked a

167
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,740
password that you did realize it quickly

168
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:33,500
and the network take can take

169
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,199
countermeasures then the goal of Black

170
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,669
Widow is also to have some automation of

171
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,810
course you could annual analyze the the

172
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,969
dark web manually but the goal of this

173
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,380
system is to have as much automation as

174
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,870
possible to relevant to collect the

175
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,340
relevant data across the domain and

176
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,320
across the language to fuse it together

177
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,500
and infer relationships between the

178
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,270
actors and also between the leaks and so

179
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,770
to have a better understanding and

180
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:03,409
understanding of the big picture so here

181
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,969
on this slide I'm highlighting the

182
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,900
overall architecture of Black Widow

183
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:11,030
which is basically inspired by the

184
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,669
intelligence cycle so the intelligence

185
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,159
cycle is a recurrent model with five

186
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,609
phases starting with the planning and

187
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,919
requirement phase followed by collection

188
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,199
processing analysis and dissemination so

189
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,250
these are the five phases that can be

190
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,039
used a couple of times to refine the

191
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,370
search and to get more data and to make

192
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,828
sense for for the for the analyst so

193
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,479
what is the the contribution of this

194
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:40,189
paper and this work that we have been

195
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,409
doing is trying to automate as much as

196
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,740
possible these phases in the

197
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,319
intelligence cycle to make this

198
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,700
monitoring more more scalable so the the

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,190
first phase which is

200
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,200
requirement is difficult to automate but

201
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,790
all the other phases the all four phase

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,480
have been automate such that there is no

203
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,969
need anymore for analysis to basically

204
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,540
do some manual processing so everything

205
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,040
is done it's done automatically so I

206
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,079
will I lied a little bit each face

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,050
individually so the first thing you need

208
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,660
to do is basically specify as an analyst

209
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,939
what is your interest so which forms you

210
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,760
want to focus on and also to acquire

211
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,100
access because in the dark web a lot of

212
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,930
forums that are interesting they require

213
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,110
to authenticate so there is access

214
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,540
control so there you need to get some

215
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,670
some credentials this sometimes you need

216
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,180
to provide just register and provide an

217
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,400
email address

218
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,709
sometimes in there are systems that

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,290
require you to buy some credits or there

220
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,990
are systems that require you to get some

221
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,079
reputation and interact in order to get

222
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,700
some some access to the forum first so

223
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,380
but as soon as we have this then the

224
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,370
idea is to have an automated data

225
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:54,470
collection which is basically some micro

226
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,750
services which will open anonymous

227
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,420
connections to these forums and start

228
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,250
collecting data there are the the

229
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,900
challenge compared to classical web

230
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,420
pruning basically these are web crawlers

231
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,970
and in that case we implement them to

232
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,339
crawl these forums the the challenge

233
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,010
there is that they since you need to be

234
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,790
authenticated you often also need to

235
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,330
have to implement and to execute the

236
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,069
JavaScript that is provided by this

237
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,540
service so you cannot apply this

238
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,550
classical crawling technique that are

239
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,980
stateless and will just grab all the

240
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,560
HTML so basically what we need to do

241
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,600
here is to have what we did is a

242
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,430
headless browser which is basically

243
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,190
emulating our user is browsing in the

244
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,550
forum and this way collecting

245
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,760
information in an automated way so but

246
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:50,150
we used the puppeteer headless browser

247
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,030
from Chrome which is basically allowing

248
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,370
us to do this in a reasonable amount of

249
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,920
time

250
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,130
then then the next step is about getting

251
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,059
the data so basically what we collect is

252
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:06,149
HTML data so this is on

253
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,858
structured or structured in a sense with

254
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,319
HTML but what is interesting for us is

255
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:12,089
the real content and the metadata of the

256
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,089
things that have been discussed so first

257
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:17,159
we need to post it and extract the

258
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:20,939
information but before we can really

259
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:23,039
fuse it and and make it make it usable

260
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:25,409
we need to translate it and here we

261
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,559
apply machine translation so the idea is

262
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:30,479
to collect information from any language

263
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,618
and then translate everything to English

264
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:35,909
this is the common representation

265
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:38,459
language of BlackWidow where basically

266
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:42,149
all information can then be fused in a

267
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,888
common language and then the afterwards

268
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,799
when everything is translated the idea

269
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:50,939
is to extract information so extract

270
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:54,809
topics extract text and also authors who

271
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:57,868
is interacting then the analysis part

272
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,819
consists of inferring relationships so

273
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:01,469
there are a lot of relationships but

274
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,529
there are not direct relationships for

275
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:07,409
example in social media you have people

276
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,859
following each other or people that are

277
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,539
friends

278
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:12,209
these are explicit connections between

279
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,009
the users in the in the community but in

280
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,628
the dark web typically you don't have

281
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,759
this explicit relations between the

282
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:20,549
users so what we need to do is to come

283
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,799
up and infer the relationships who is

284
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:24,809
interacting with whom and this is done

285
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,478
by looking at the threats and who is

286
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:29,608
posting and replying to which post and

287
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:32,369
by analyzing this information we

288
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:34,799
actually build user relationships and

289
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:37,189
try to understand who is interacting

290
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,749
with whom and build the social graph

291
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,579
also we want to link data sources so

292
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:43,679
this in this analysis part we start

293
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,799
linking data source from the different

294
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,409
forums and to build statistics to

295
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,489
identify trends also find hacks and

296
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:57,509
leaks for example and then finally the

297
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:59,549
the information is visualized and made

298
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,589
available in the form of dashboards it's

299
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:04,468
also possible to produce alerts if

300
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:07,069
certain things pop up or it's also

301
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:09,569
possible for the user to have queries

302
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:12,029
specifying what is interested in and

303
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:15,809
what he wants to look for so substrate

304
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,470
is also a query interface so at the

305
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,060
heart of

306
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,860
Black Widow is actually a knowledge

307
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,709
graph this is this is the brain of the

308
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,220
system because every information that we

309
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,110
will make available to the user is

310
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,240
represented in this knowledge graph so

311
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,670
this knowledge graph is a semantic model

312
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,250
of the forms so basically it models

313
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,500
threads actors messages and topics

314
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,160
things you we find directly in the

315
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,680
forums but it's also fusing information

316
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,069
that we infer ourselves with our

317
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,500
algorithms so for example topics we do

318
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,170
some topic labeling and topic

319
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,030
classification based on machine learning

320
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,260
techniques this is something we infer

321
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,730
and then we put in this knowledge graph

322
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,680
we also for example further language

323
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,320
this is also some information we put

324
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,359
there and so on so at the end we have a

325
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,250
relatively large graph basically we

326
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,260
represents all the information that we

327
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,760
have gathered infused from all the

328
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,770
different firms in the different

329
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:20,210
languages so to evaluate BlackWidow we

330
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:24,689
we performed a study so where we

331
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:28,860
analyzed seven forums that were

332
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,860
available a few months ago so for forms

333
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,140
from the Deep Web three forums from the

334
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,190
dark web in three languages in English

335
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,500
Russian and French as you can see a

336
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,090
couple of forms I've already are no

337
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,290
longer available they disappeared

338
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:50,880
so if you month later only four firm are

339
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:55,459
still available so this gives you a

340
00:14:50,880 --> 00:15:00,770
first impression of what what the black

341
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:04,200
widow a dark Widow was able to collect

342
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,390
in a couple of days so basically we run

343
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,400
this experiment is study for a couple of

344
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,160
tests and try to collect from these four

345
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,050
forms as much information as possible so

346
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,209
depending on the forum and the size of

347
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,819
the forum we collected information about

348
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,850
a couple of thousand to six to eight

349
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,160
thousand users and depending on the

350
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,050
language in the forum between ten

351
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,390
thousand and three hundred thousand

352
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,800
posts perform this is roughly the de

353
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,420
size

354
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,750
the author of this problem that we were

355
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:39,300
targeting so the first insight that we

356
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,390
can analyze the type of analysis that we

357
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,329
can do is inferring cross form

358
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,769
relationship so here the question was to

359
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:50,459
understand if there are for example

360
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:53,250
actors that are active in different

361
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,380
forums at the same time so what we did

362
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,410
here and what is plotted here in this

363
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,200
Court diagram is basically the cross

364
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,420
form or relationship and this is

365
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:07,950
computed by looking at if there are

366
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,800
users account user names that appear in

367
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:13,589
different forums so if the same appear

368
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,140
and then we we make a relationship

369
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,910
between the different form so what is

370
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,779
kind of interesting here to note is that

371
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,149
there are quite a lot of relationships

372
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,850
and we are pretty sure that of course

373
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,899
the user names in a forum is can being

374
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,910
being ambiguous because there is no it's

375
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,910
not unique between the different forums

376
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,790
but the the the the user names that were

377
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,010
used in different forms what usually

378
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,099
quite distinct so it's very unlikely

379
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,589
that the person to different person

380
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,940
we're using the same username in a

381
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,520
different forum so it's very likely that

382
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,860
it belongs to the same person so what we

383
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,839
see here that across the same language

384
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,550
of course we have relationship but it's

385
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,399
also very interesting to note that we

386
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,199
even have relationships across languages

387
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,280
for example between Russian and French

388
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,050
also English and in Russian so it seems

389
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,000
to be that there are some actors that

390
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:14,399
are active on that many platforms at the

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,109
same time so then this is another type

392
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,709
of analysis that we can do with black

393
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:23,219
widow is to look at user relationships

394
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,939
and communities within a forum as I said

395
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,490
earlier we have an analysis phase where

396
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,370
we infer the relationship if you have a

397
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,410
threat and you have a post there by a

398
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,469
user and that creates a threat and then

399
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,500
you have replies by other users then if

400
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,630
a user replies later on to the this in

401
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,880
this threat we declare a relation

402
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,090
ship so with that model we can create

403
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,840
the social graph and what black widow

404
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:54,419
does it applies some community detection

405
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,490
techniques to find if there are

406
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,980
communities so here on the left we see

407
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,130
for example the communities that

408
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,890
appeared in form four and on the right

409
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,410
in the forum five we see the communities

410
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,870
what you can see here is that there are

411
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,750
some in on the left there are more

412
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,209
smaller communities whereas on the right

413
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,850
there are it's it's more a few few

414
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,530
communities but larger ones which means

415
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,379
that on the Left these are people that

416
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,210
are talking about small communities

417
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,300
talking about the specific topic whereas

418
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,280
on the right it's more like one person

419
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,190
that is disseminating information to a

420
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,110
broad public so with this type of

421
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,840
analysis you can then try to understand

422
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:43,860
our information disseminates in the dark

423
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:45,899
web so here finally I've also here I can

424
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,689
show you what black with a black widow

425
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,330
can do in terms of trend analysis so

426
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,550
during during this few days of

427
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:58,169
monitoring black widow was able to

428
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:03,419
collect data from 2013 to 2018 so five

429
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:08,160
years of off data which we Black Widow

430
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,930
can use to identify trends on specific

431
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,650
topics so what we can see here is a time

432
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,390
series for botnets databases distributed

433
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,850
another service attacks exploits and

434
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,670
leaks basically this is what black widow

435
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,889
has identified as a topic if I if I if I

436
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,260
mention if a post is mentioning this

437
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,990
topic so what we can see here is that

438
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,200
the the trend for example for data leaks

439
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,600
is increasing over time so we have

440
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,690
almost in the last year we have almost a

441
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,280
tenfold increase compared to to the

442
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:42,240
beginning so it seems that there are

443
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:46,110
much more activities across aggregated

444
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:50,690
or overall forms on on data leaks also

445
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:53,429
database is the second most active topic

446
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,610
seems quite active

447
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,970
so exploits it's a relatively constant

448
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:02,340
over time and distribute denial of

449
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:06,390
service attacks and botnets you can see

450
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,780
that it's the slowest the the lowest

451
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:13,230
count and you can see a very large peak

452
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,720
in 2016 which we analyzed in more detail

453
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,220
but we discovered that this peak is due

454
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,140
to the fact that one of the form was

455
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,330
actually hit by denial of service attack

456
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,809
and then people in this form actually

457
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,750
talking about about it but it's not a

458
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,750
general trend that there was more

459
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,620
activities on sharing also distributed

460
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,919
denial of service or the botnet tools

461
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,530
okay so this brings me to the conclusion

462
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,290
so we with this project with this

463
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,590
research we have been able to to show

464
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:50,100
and to understand how we could use dark

465
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:53,220
and deep web analysis and especially to

466
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,559
make to make the analysis more automated

467
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,450
I think that what's especially important

468
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,440
in this area it's quite a complex

469
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:04,320
environment and we need in order to make

470
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,799
this scaleable we really need to have

471
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,370
some automation tools so we have final

472
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,770
Israel it can be quite useful to monitor

473
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,290
also the activities but also to monitor

474
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,080
the trends and to search with an

475
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:22,918
approach like black widows so we touched

476
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,720
a couple of challenges and of course we

477
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,240
didn't solve everything but we at least

478
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,190
we addressed some important challenges

479
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,860
in terms of automated knowledge

480
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,679
extraction translation relationship

481
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:39,178
analysis across language barriers and

482
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,910
forums so it's it's also it was we were

483
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,760
able to also observe within a couple of

484
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:47,760
days of monitoring we were also able to

485
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,040
observe trends over the past few years

486
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,820
for example the forms we have been

487
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,980
looking at we realised that leaks of

488
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,990
becoming a crucial trend over recent

489
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,600
years in in the dark web and especially

490
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,750
in these forms to share information and

491
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,189
trade information about data leaks so

492
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,660
with that I want to thank you for your

493
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,720
attention and I'm happy to take

494
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,720
questions

495
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,720
so thanks very much Vincent in fact we

496
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,700
have a immediately one question in the

497
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,350
in the front and we'll entertain a

498
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,620
couple more short questions before we

499
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,500
move on simple question how much

500
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,929
handwork is involved for each forum or

501
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,420
is it just press the baton but not get

502
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:35,530
the pictures yes I mean the pictures are

503
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,440
computed automatically so basically

504
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,840
everything is taught in a in the graph

505
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,110
is taught in elasticsearch so and this

506
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,510
allows you to build the dashboards and

507
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,000
views and graph so this is basically

508
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,800
automated so and everything also the

509
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,200
data collection is automated so these

510
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,850
are crawlers that crawl extract

511
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,130
information atom automatically feed it

512
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,709
into the knowledge graph and then update

513
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,330
it regularly to get the Fu of what's

514
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:07,470
going on okay we have another question

515
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,689
in the far right thank you for your talk

516
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,480
to deliver and now analyze information

517
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,700
you need to acquire it and the challenge

518
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,860
that I'm see facing in the dark web is

519
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,140
and maybe you can explain how you did

520
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,090
approach how did you identify those

521
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,970
seven forums because identifying those

522
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,709
forums might be a bit of a trick how do

523
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,570
you ensure that they actually delivered

524
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,540
the required information that you would

525
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:34,600
be making tangible and also how did you

526
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:37,090
acquire access to them yes as I said

527
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,850
this is this is the only part this is

528
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,830
the first part the planning and

529
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,379
requirements is the first part of this

530
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,960
intelligence cycle this is the only part

531
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,810
that is not automated so basically in

532
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,060
order to find the interesting forums

533
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,460
that are interested for interesting for

534
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,860
cyber security they still some manual

535
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,880
selection process that must be going on

536
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,120
but because there are also a lot of

537
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,760
forums or sites that are not related to

538
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,040
security and this in don't necessarily

539
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,540
need need to address yes that is correct

540
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,270
but I'm following I want to know exactly

541
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:13,450
how did you choose them what was your

542
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,820
approach not the theory around it right

543
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,800
okay so there are lists and there are

544
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,560
basically Vicky's a lot of Vicky's in

545
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,360
the dark web but also in the surface web

546
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,179
which lists basically all the

547
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,429
onion links and then you can check them

548
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,950
out but this list are usually very

549
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,530
quickly up they're outdated so you will

550
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,420
see that most of the links don't work

551
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,930
anymore so this is some tedious work to

552
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,370
basically check and verify if if these

553
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,410
things are still working and if this is

554
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,939
something something behind it then you

555
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,500
can what you can also do and this is

556
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,870
something that can be automated is then

557
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,540
to follow the hyperlinks from the forms

558
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,629
that you already monitoring but as I

559
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,940
said the the trend there is actually not

560
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,920
to have too many hyperlinks so this is

561
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,200
not really a scalable approach you will

562
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,270
find further interesting forums by

563
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,070
following some links but this cannot be

564
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:08,139
the only solution do we have another

565
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:13,929
question on the side of the room that I

566
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:19,360
missed okay I think in order to keep on

567
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:21,910
time will thank Vincent again and I'd

568
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,979
like to invite Java crash now up and

569
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,600
give us our last talk after which we'll

570
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,360
have some time for some overarching

571
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,219
questions as well so thank you thank you

572
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,860
very much it's a great honor for being

573
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,920
here and being the last peek or in this

574
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,260
session because my plan is to reflect to

575
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,080
my colleagues and give some additional

576
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,170
information for what they said because

577
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,770
we also have a lot of experience in that

578
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,750
field because because of the nature of

579
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,360
my Institute and because of the research

580
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,480
what I will talk about later so who am i

581
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,770
9 but I'm representing here I'm the

582
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,300
program director of the cybersecurity

583
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,950
Academy at the National University of

584
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,180
Public Service Hungary which is the

585
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,140
governmental University and we are

586
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:07,150
responsible for the education and of

587
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,220
different officers military police

588
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,800
officers Disaster Management officers

589
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,930
and public servants as well and we are

590
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,610
also responsible for the research what

591
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,590
is important and interesting for the

592
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,139
government especially on the cyber space

593
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,320
now and the cyber secretary must found

594
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:26,470
it to somehow help this kind of research

595
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,330
and educational activities and why the

596
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,830
cyber space is important for the

597
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,020
Hungarian government because it is

598
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,340
important for the others as well and

599
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,320
they are interested in what really

600
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,100
happens in the cyber space and they want

601
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,409
to know

602
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,740
whether they are attacked or not and

603
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,690
there are some organizations who wants

604
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,640
to know who are behind the attack

605
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,400
what is the attribution the others are

606
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,290
just want to know the fact that they are

607
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,940
attacked and want to do something

608
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:56,649
against them against such attacks and

609
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,400
based on that experience and based on

610
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,160
their needs

611
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,580
it seems that although prevention is

612
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:07,210
still important detection is getting on

613
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,270
the peak and I think most of you and

614
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,210
most of us have understood that we won't

615
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:17,020
able to prevent everything therefore we

616
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:20,440
have to detect such attacks and in case

617
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,540
of well state-sponsored attacks in case

618
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,480
of complex attacks in case of attacks

619
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,760
that are not made by ordinary cyber

620
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,620
criminals such detection is quite

621
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,250
challenging the technology what we've

622
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,229
heard is quite good but I can tell you

623
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,690
that many times the attacks are not so

624
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,210
sophisticated that is need to be because

625
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,950
although we come by some privileged

626
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,880
access some adding the admin credentials

627
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,380
on the dark web in my experience in the

628
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,780
last almost 20 years that I spent

629
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,610
together with developers I can tell you

630
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,560
that the most common password for an

631
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,810
admin or a root password is used to be a

632
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,580
in test environment on development

633
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:04,149
environment of course there are so many

634
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:06,159
legal or compliance requirements that

635
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,200
that does that two-factor authentication

636
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,440
is important especially in case of

637
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,470
privileged users but trust me in most

638
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,210
test environments a or password or one

639
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,500
two three four five or similars I used

640
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:22,990
to be used and well it's may be may be

641
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,050
acceptable if those servers are sitting

642
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:30,010
somewhere behind in your data center but

643
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,919
as the cloud is emerging and we are now

644
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,900
talking about DevOps and we are talking

645
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,970
about those guys who are developing the

646
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:41,020
programs and then installing their

647
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:42,790
servers into Amazon or Asia and they are

648
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,000
still using a for a password

649
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:48,610
in such cases or they even write their

650
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,480
credentials their Hadiya hard-coded

651
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,790
their credentials

652
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,560
into source codes that are uploaded to

653
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,649
github I think it's getting serious

654
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,120
therefore those admin credentials will

655
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:03,220
be used in one step of a direct or a

656
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,389
targeted attack and I think most of you

657
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,940
are already familiar with this picture

658
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,730
that is the cyber couch a mother from

659
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,710
Lockheed Martin from 2008 and that tells

660
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,560
that the first step is used to be the

661
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,870
reconnaissance part finding those be a

662
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,210
person's fighting those users who will

663
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,760
be that are their target in a targeted

664
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:29,350
attack and it's fairly easy nowadays

665
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:31,780
because just buying a data data set from

666
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,110
the from the dark web can help us to

667
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,810
find those users who might be privileged

668
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:41,830
and their account their credentials

669
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:44,530
might be used to access the the servers

670
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,750
and for the second part for the web for

671
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,860
the weaponization part we can also buy

672
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:54,280
several zero days but in based on the

673
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:57,129
experiences zero days are are rarely

674
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,510
used because because the the common DD

675
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,120
free the open source the freely

676
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,670
available tools can be used for directed

677
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,739
attacks as well the second picture is

678
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,120
made from the attack may attack matrix

679
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,260
for enterprise this is this is the

680
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,090
attack framework from the mitre

681
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,890
corporation and that shows the the usual

682
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,810
steps of a targeted attacks and

683
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,670
somewhere in the middle we can see the

684
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,790
privilege escalation and the lateral

685
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,830
movement movement parts so yes we are

686
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,920
talking a lot about what happens if a

687
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,340
ten point is attacked what happens if

688
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:33,220
our Windows client is for example

689
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,580
infected by a malicious malicious code

690
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,280
but sometimes in the middle of an attack

691
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,169
the attacker wants to move further and

692
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,139
want to get a privileged access a

693
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,870
privileged account and wants to find the

694
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,940
really interesting servers in the

695
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,840
network architecture and they will find

696
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:56,260
but how I think the SSH part was quite

697
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,949
interesting especially for the ICS SCADA

698
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:02,230
systems because yeah Sherando Taiyo is

699
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,250
very good source that we can find that

700
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,460
still a lots of lot

701
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:09,790
of SSH access are open on the internet

702
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:12,610
but nowadays our DP and PowerShell is

703
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,730
the most widely used attack vectors in

704
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:19,030
case of lateral movements and I would

705
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,580
like to emphasis the next big steps the

706
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,190
api's because as more and more IOT

707
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,550
devices will be planted into the network

708
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,480
at the API communication will be I think

709
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:35,080
the next huge threat for for the

710
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,680
directed attacks targeted attacks not to

711
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,649
say that as I mentioned I think there

712
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,180
are lots of common tools and freely

713
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,490
available tools that can be downloaded

714
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,740
from the internet and those are widely

715
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:51,370
used in state-sponsored attacks as well

716
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,380
so in last October the the US Department

717
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,689
of Homeland Security has released a very

718
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,580
interesting announcement this alert the

719
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,680
public on the publicly available tools

720
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,949
seen in cyber incidents worldwide and

721
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,290
they mentioned five tools that are

722
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,720
commonly used in stay in state sponsor

723
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,550
attacks and the last three one the

724
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,500
credential stealer mimic as the lateral

725
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,370
movement framework partial Empire and

726
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,120
receive - obfuscation and exfiltration

727
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:21,040
HUC packet transmitter that is why I

728
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,290
highlighted those three tools is the

729
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:28,510
reason that they can be used to steal

730
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:30,520
the privileged credentials inside by

731
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,010
ordering during a targeted attack I

732
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,889
think from those tools the nimac at Swan

733
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:39,129
is the most interesting one as that tool

734
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:43,510
was used for not Pacha as well and it's

735
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:45,850
direct it's it's a direct goal is to

736
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,680
steal the pretty privileged credentials

737
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,330
from the memory of the infected

738
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,150
computers why this isn't why is it

739
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:54,909
important because if we have the

740
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:57,160
privileged account from the memory of a

741
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,500
computer that might be connected to a

742
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,830
network that might contain for example a

743
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,860
domain controller of course we can or

744
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,990
the attacker can move further and can

745
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,800
hack the the domain controller as well

746
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:14,980
or several other servers as well and why

747
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,428
I highlighted the mimikatz one because a

748
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,429
lot of

749
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,390
state-sponsored groups or who are

750
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,960
attributed a space say state-sponsored

751
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:28,480
has have used that tool before in their

752
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,200
attacks like a PT one that is a preview

753
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,420
to attributed to China or a PT 28 that

754
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,190
is attributed to Russia or the Lazarus

755
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,170
group which is attributed to North Korea

756
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,710
and not to mention NSA because I think

757
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:43,990
the metal MITRE corporation is not

758
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:47,800
mentioning the the NSA in these groups

759
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:51,040
but I think they are also might use at

760
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,810
least one part of the mimikatz because

761
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,740
it's a very useful tool and this works

762
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:59,379
since 2007 or something so it can be it

763
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,620
can be very very useful the problem the

764
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,560
time maybe most of you are also familiar

765
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,899
with this Verizon data breach report and

766
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,690
with this figure from the data Beach

767
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,210
report and why I highlighted this one is

768
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,830
the reason that we don't have time

769
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,850
therefore we need something that can

770
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:22,360
help us to identify the attacks in time

771
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:25,719
just one example a month ago a Hungarian

772
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,620
small Hungarian cloud provider has been

773
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:32,408
hacked and a few thousand credentials

774
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:36,130
were stolen from their servers in three

775
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:38,950
days the whole data set has appeared in

776
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:43,210
a dark web forum in a Russian dark web

777
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:46,899
forum for $200 so fairly cheap but as

778
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:49,840
that data set contained directly

779
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,569
Hungarian interesting credentials that

780
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,940
might be interesting for those

781
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:58,150
state-sponsored groups who are targeting

782
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:01,000
the Hungarian companies or Hungarian

783
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:04,870
organizations as well so just offed

784
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,180
right after the hack in three days there

785
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:10,900
were the whole data set and the problem

786
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:13,089
is that although the or that

787
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,010
organization was made a good Japan they

788
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,560
identified the attack just in time in

789
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,870
many cases and based on our interviews

790
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,549
and our researches the reason is that we

791
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,220
are not able to identify the data

792
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:26,050
breaches in time in days the first time

793
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,589
when we are realized that we were hacked

794
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,660
as when our vendor data that is that

795
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:36,970
stolen from our organization appears on

796
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:40,359
the darknet so or someone just does the

797
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,490
local data protection authority that his

798
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,880
or her data is on the dark web

799
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:49,240
so maybe months or even years right

800
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,910
after the the hack we can we can

801
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,069
identify the the fact that we were

802
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,680
hacked so we don't have time we need to

803
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,870
do something and now I'm turning to the

804
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,680
research part because the research what

805
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:05,230
we made is try to or has tried to give

806
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,129
some ideas that how the machine learning

807
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,930
can be used to help that the reducing

808
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,780
the time and which are the major

809
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,740
problems to identify the stolen

810
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,230
privilege that counts

811
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,279
that research was made by my university

812
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,890
and the Budapest University of

813
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,890
Technology and economics with the

814
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,950
Department of agronomy and psychology

815
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:29,350
and that was an industrial project what

816
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,569
we made together with the Hungarian

817
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,569
development branch of one identity one

818
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:37,090
of the leading developer of privileged

819
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:40,210
access management and what we try to

820
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,270
understand is how the current security

821
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:46,060
operation centers are focusing on

822
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,280
privileged accounts how how can they

823
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,590
solve the problems of privileged

824
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,050
accounts so just a few words on the

825
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,090
research prior research background that

826
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:59,770
was a larger security operations center

827
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:02,050
research we Mead we made many interviews

828
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,520
on the field we visited several security

829
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,650
operation centers but not just in

830
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,000
Hungary but in Europe and in the United

831
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,160
States as well

832
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,320
we also made in the interviews with key

833
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,410
industry analyst test of course we had a

834
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,440
lot so I think that what I will tell you

835
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:20,470
is kind of a state of the art now and we

836
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,620
had a lot of hypotheses but now just one

837
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,450
focusing on the privileged users one of

838
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,589
our hypothesis was that product that the

839
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,390
protection against the privileged

840
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:35,800
account hajeck is a major concern for

841
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:37,990
them and yeah that that was the the one

842
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,960
of the major research question and what

843
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:43,089
we found is two types of secretary

844
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,549
position centers first of all there are

845
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:48,609
security departments with integrated

846
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:51,279
security operations have a very source

847
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:53,259
major security operation center in place

848
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:56,229
and more and more security operation

849
00:37:53,259 --> 00:38:01,269
centers are operating worldwide maybe

850
00:37:56,229 --> 00:38:03,879
they are now called fusion centers maybe

851
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:06,098
they are still using the name Caesar tor

852
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,119
or they are just assert so I don't want

853
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:12,700
to go into the abbreviation war what we

854
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,519
had during the research let's call them

855
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:18,069
security operation centers but although

856
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,808
there are thousands of security of

857
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:22,299
values for security operation centers

858
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,549
worldwide most of the companies and most

859
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:26,380
of the organizations are still

860
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:29,049
struggling with the problem that they

861
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,579
have small security departments with

862
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:33,430
lack of resources with no security

863
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:36,150
patient center with no or limited scene

864
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:38,640
and of course with no capability to

865
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,890
identify the potentially stolen

866
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,529
privileged accounts I don't want to be

867
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:47,589
nor the previous engineer neither the

868
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:49,749
data scientists of one identity because

869
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:52,690
I'm the cybersecurity guy from the

870
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:55,089
universities so I didn't want to tell

871
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,769
the details of the technical part but as

872
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:59,440
based on your questions you are

873
00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:02,738
interested in I want to highlight some

874
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,880
very interesting results from the

875
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:06,489
research and from the product

876
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,700
development first of all the hypotheses

877
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:12,039
the sixth one in this research was that

878
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,598
the understanding the attackers behavior

879
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:18,160
is important and that was confirmed

880
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:21,460
based on the interviews because as you

881
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,788
you mentioned you mentioned you were it

882
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,499
was you mentioned that the usage of the

883
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:28,960
honey pots are important because we need

884
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:31,359
real-time data we need some real-time

885
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,690
active real activities real-life

886
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,489
activities the security patient center

887
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,950
analysts also need the real-life

888
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:43,690
examples but unfortunately the honey

889
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:45,788
pots couldn't be so real-life and of

890
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,640
course from the internet we are not able

891
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,279
to download datasets that can help us to

892
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:56,200
understand the real activities therefore

893
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:57,460
if we somehow can help the analysts to

894
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,730
provide

895
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,410
the real-life examples of data what the

896
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,720
state spawned merely the space stress

897
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,029
was our attackers are doing that can

898
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,569
help a lot to fine-tune the prevention

899
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,099
part of the companies this next - assist

900
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,650
was that a privileged account monitoring

901
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:20,200
is challenging that is plausible and I

902
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:24,849
would say that the Abid from the

903
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:29,069
technological part the SSH is one that

904
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:32,680
can be fairly easily analyzed and

905
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:35,650
through SSH we can fairly easy see what

906
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,930
the privileged users are doing so it's

907
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,750
kind of an easy protocol but for example

908
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:44,410
in our DP or in PowerShell which are

909
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:47,260
widely used among the the privileged

910
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,470
users it's a bit challenging especially

911
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,750
in PowerShell so from the research

912
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,029
perspective I propose to move to the

913
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,160
PowerShell part I think that's quite

914
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,960
interesting and the next hypothesis is

915
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,899
what does the user behavior analytics is

916
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,640
useful so the machine learning

917
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,280
implementing machine learning into that

918
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,759
part is also something that might be

919
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,040
useful and I can tell you that the user

920
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,920
behavior ITEX is really working so the

921
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,349
technology itself is quite useful so the

922
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,740
company could develop a loss of user

923
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:24,220
behavior machine learning analytics to

924
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:29,339
boost the SS agent to the RDP RDP part

925
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:33,000
and with the help of machine learning

926
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:36,160
they could identify both the outliers

927
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,520
they can differentiate the human

928
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,629
activities from the machine activities

929
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:46,900
they could also help in the they could

930
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:50,950
also develop biometrics behavioral

931
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:54,430
biometrics both on the keystroke and the

932
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,930
mouse movements so I think that the user

933
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,020
behavior Isaacs and the machine learning

934
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:01,810
could be the real solution for the

935
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:04,210
identification of such a task why

936
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,890
because we have a problems because in

937
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,710
real life in a Security Operations

938
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,589
Center there are too many alerts good

939
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:14,220
because

940
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:16,380
the seam is like this to many others but

941
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,859
the lack of human resource to process

942
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,750
them is something that is a common daily

943
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,550
problem for for moved off most of the

944
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,620
socks simply we don't have enough

945
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,500
analysts we don't have any people we

946
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:30,120
don't have any human and that that is

947
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,900
why we came into the picture in this

948
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:37,490
research because we have some young

949
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,870
cadets on my university some future

950
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:42,899
officers who will serve in the Hungarian

951
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:47,190
Defense Forces someone who will serve as

952
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:49,110
cyber various cyber experts in the

953
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:53,310
military and will day and they will go

954
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:56,550
to the Muellers therefore we sit then in

955
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:58,770
front of this same system or or this

956
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,170
user behavior system and we want it to

957
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,860
understand how the young cadets are

958
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:08,970
reacting to the problems how they can

959
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:10,740
identify the stolen privileges and I can

960
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,930
tell you that from the user experience

961
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,020
part this is a bit challenging because

962
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:19,560
in real life privilege escalation and

963
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,390
lateral movements are rarely happen it's

964
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,720
not something that that is a regular

965
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,600
problem

966
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,129
yes cyber criminals are in the de

967
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,930
networks on a daily base but

968
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,360
state-sponsored attackers are rarely

969
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,060
appear in most cases in most of the

970
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,400
organizations so from the UX part the

971
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,410
major challenge was how to help the

972
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,630
cadets or or in general how to help the

973
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,700
security analysts to identify that is

974
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,120
that this is not a false positive this

975
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,529
is something that needs to be clarified

976
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,250
because high profile attacks remain

977
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:53,780
uncovered in the huge load therefore

978
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:57,390
it's very tough to to identify them so

979
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,920
and as so machine learning can be very

980
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,930
useful there for them but for a

981
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,330
successful machine learning you have to

982
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:07,440
have a baseline but if you want to have

983
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:12,509
a baseline you have to follow the users

984
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,270
follow the human users that raises some

985
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,400
privacy questions and in Hungary and in

986
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,640
generally Europe we have to keep in mind

987
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,190
privacy as well so that the technology

988
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,629
is there unfortunately it seems my slide

989
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:29,300
is a little bit

990
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:32,300
changed but in the hype cycle of

991
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,160
gardener in 2016 you can see machine

992
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,550
learning and software-defined security

993
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,680
on the peak in 2018 those two

994
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,200
technologies has been disappeared from

995
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,190
this list because they are now the

996
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,140
reality they can be used in the security

997
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,600
as well and there are more and more

998
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:53,210
products that will appear in your

999
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,400
organization I think the vendors will

1000
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,980
knock on your doors with the technology

1001
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,890
so you can use it but the question is

1002
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,480
what is your goal is it useful what

1003
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,120
should we do should we catch the next

1004
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,560
Manning the next well guy who is sitting

1005
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,359
next to a computer with some kind of

1006
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,930
credentials should we catch the next

1007
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:15,890
Snowden with high profile access with a

1008
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:18,020
high profile account in the order in the

1009
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,730
organization or should we catch the

1010
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,430
external attacker who will steal the

1011
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:26,210
snow don't like credential from for

1012
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:30,410
example a data breach and who will play

1013
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,080
or who will do the stuff inside the

1014
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:35,120
organization like Snowden did who knows

1015
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,610
what is your goal you have to decide it

1016
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,920
but that's the conclusion I would say

1017
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:43,130
that in general the passwords are dead

1018
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,590
what we told I think 10 years ago 20

1019
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:48,320
years ago but they are really dead so we

1020
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,960
have to find a new technology or if we

1021
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,460
have to still live together with

1022
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,770
passwords we have to find new

1023
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,720
technologies that will help us to

1024
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,420
identify the potentially stolen

1025
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,020
passwords or credentials and machine

1026
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:05,090
learning will be that do I think thank

1027
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,660
you very much for attention and I'm open

1028
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,660
to the question

1029
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:12,400
thanks very much shoving it's very very

1030
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,680
nice that you actually tied things

1031
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,520
together as well so let's go around the

1032
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:21,270
room for some questions

1033
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,270
we have someone back there

1034
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:33,079
hello again how and maybe not not only

1035
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,410
for you but for for everyone here

1036
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:39,559
how are you confident and how are you

1037
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:42,680
going to get large data sets of targeted

1038
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:45,200
attacks because they are not a lot

1039
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,440
there's a lot of noise and noise is

1040
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,839
ransomware or just the stupid attacks

1041
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,049
that are very easy to detect and to

1042
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:57,430
prevent but machine learning needs a

1043
00:46:54,049 --> 00:47:01,160
huge amount of data targeted attacks

1044
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:04,368
when you're lucky you see one in a

1045
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,890
period of weeks or months if you are not

1046
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:11,660
lucky a little bit more but don't expect

1047
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:13,730
a lot of dots on the radar I agree with

1048
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,210
that so as I mentioned I'm not nor the

1049
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,309
priestess

1050
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,009
neither the data scientist but I can

1051
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:23,660
tell you what was the solution for that

1052
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:25,460
in our case so in our case and that is

1053
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,519
why I highlighted the middle of the

1054
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:31,309
targeted attacks because if we know that

1055
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:34,189
how the administrators are used to work

1056
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:37,039
what is our ordinary keystroke mouse

1057
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:40,999
movement commands applications that they

1058
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:43,549
are open to RDP we can have a very

1059
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:46,160
confident baseline of their usual

1060
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:48,349
activities and we can with these machine

1061
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,819
learning algorithms we can identify the

1062
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:52,839
potential anomalies which are not

1063
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:55,670
similar to their daily job and we can

1064
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,349
highlight we can or we can notify the

1065
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,059
analyst that hey there might be

1066
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:03,460
something that you have to keep your

1067
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:05,900
your eyes on and please just follow that

1068
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,519
remote session and see what happens

1069
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:12,049
inside because that might be an attack

1070
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,508
I'm very glad actually that the question

1071
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:16,059
asker also mentioned this could be for

1072
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:18,980
other people as well so feel free to

1073
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:21,950
jump in about beer and and pencil if you

1074
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,640
have something to add to this another

1075
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,649
question

1076
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,460
perhaps from this side of the room it's

1077
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:30,640
been somewhat less inclined question

1078
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,640
wise

1079
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:37,910
anyone over that way okay let me pose

1080
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,380
then you know one of the the several

1081
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,450
questions that I've collected along the

1082
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,519
way so one of the things that you didn't

1083
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,259
mention but is is absolutely true of

1084
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,718
course many places are trying to move

1085
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,619
toward zero trust networking or

1086
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,630
something like that

1087
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:53,749
so of course this was moved to the cloud

1088
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:55,460
in many cases means that no longer do

1089
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:57,919
you have systems hidden behind firewalls

1090
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,349
in any case so I think this is a

1091
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,989
universal problem regardless of whether

1092
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:05,269
people go to a zero or AWS or something

1093
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:07,549
else now back to the the machine

1094
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:09,410
learning approach and for example this

1095
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:11,599
question about how to get enough data in

1096
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,239
fact all of you face these kinds of

1097
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,279
issues does it not make sense to to

1098
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,979
simply collect a lot more data from

1099
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:20,619
cyber ranges or from exercises like

1100
00:49:18,979 --> 00:49:23,390
locked shields

1101
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,609
where in a sense these are generated by

1102
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,489
by friendlies anyway so there may be

1103
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:35,420
some bias issue but this is perhaps a

1104
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:38,269
prime source of of data I just I can

1105
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,180
take over because I was also doing the

1106
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:43,729
work that was presented yesterday on how

1107
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,249
to use data from locked shields to

1108
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:49,189
basically train a classifier in order to

1109
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:51,468
detect attacks I think and it goes also

1110
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,410
into the first question I think machine

1111
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:57,499
learning in a it's true it can only be

1112
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:59,719
used to detect and train classifiers to

1113
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:02,180
learn what we have seen in the past and

1114
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:04,640
to try to automate the detection of

1115
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:07,098
things that we know so if we can assume

1116
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,989
that the attacks is repetitive and it

1117
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:10,430
happens a lot of time then I think

1118
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:12,890
machine learning is a good tool to

1119
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:16,430
automate the search for this type of

1120
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:18,259
anomaly so attacks whereas if you expect

1121
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,839
to have an attack that is new has now

1122
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:23,029
never been performed before I think

1123
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:24,410
machine learning is not the right

1124
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:26,989
approach to take so there we need to

1125
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:29,450
have all the type of techniques so and

1126
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:31,130
so basically it is depend on what what

1127
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,109
kind of attacks you're trying to prevent

1128
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,210
in Lock shields this is a kind of

1129
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:37,640
repetitive environment it happens also

1130
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,769
every year as we have seen in the in the

1131
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,779
presentation yesterday it is possible to

1132
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:44,928
infer from

1133
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:46,759
one year training model and and the

1134
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:50,449
model will be valid for the next year

1135
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:52,609
but if you go to real life and you have

1136
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:55,159
a very targeted attack a determinate

1137
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:58,098
determinate a core that really wants to

1138
00:50:55,159 --> 00:51:01,819
evade all this then of course machine'll

1139
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:04,069
in links comes to its limitation indeed

1140
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:05,509
and so I don't want to take us too far

1141
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:07,429
down into the machine learning but maybe

1142
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:10,639
it's something else I could then ask for

1143
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:12,109
your comments on one of the things one

1144
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,569
of the things is that we very rarely

1145
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:16,328
hear people discussing a full diversity

1146
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:19,099
of machine learning so there's of course

1147
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:21,499
deep learning and and artificial neural

1148
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:23,359
networks of various kinds there's

1149
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:25,939
machine learning as we've discussed that

1150
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,589
today there are also other approaches

1151
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:29,899
which are more glass box machine

1152
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:31,729
learning you know considerably less

1153
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:34,249
popular than these other ones but ones

1154
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:35,839
in which you can artificially structure

1155
00:51:34,249 --> 00:51:38,868
the the knowledge graph actually it

1156
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,149
starts to look like a pre structured and

1157
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:43,699
then use supervised machine learning to

1158
00:51:41,149 --> 00:51:47,479
refine it do you see this kind of

1159
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:49,339
initial brain dump from from an analyst

1160
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,439
and then some supervised machine

1161
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,659
learning as a potential approach or

1162
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:56,118
solution to what you what you just

1163
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:57,649
mentioned or absolutely absolutely

1164
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,389
because I think that machine learning

1165
00:51:57,649 --> 00:52:02,149
machine learning is basically learning

1166
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:05,179
from data but you can also build

1167
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:06,739
artificial intelligence systems where

1168
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:10,099
you don't learn from data but you learn

1169
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:12,409
from the expert and this is probably the

1170
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:14,630
way to go because we have experts they

1171
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:17,239
have some knowledge they may know what

1172
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,789
to expect and it's possible to build

1173
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:21,409
models that will be then not learning

1174
00:52:19,789 --> 00:52:24,319
from the data but basically the experts

1175
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:26,029
we have know now so I'm very sure that

1176
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:29,179
people don't want to just hear my

1177
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:31,189
questions so please let's have a show of

1178
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:33,079
hands if there's anyone with a latent

1179
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:37,489
question that would that you'd like it

1180
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:39,970
answered otherwise I will jump in with

1181
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:42,640
one more of mine with apologies

1182
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:45,459
and then sorry Vincent sorry to pick on

1183
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,950
you again but one thing that struck me

1184
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,039
is is maybe if you look at at the work

1185
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:53,649
that there's been working on you know

1186
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,630
there's surely a whole bunch of bits and

1187
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:58,779
pieces inside Black Widow which are then

1188
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:01,809
directly applicable here you know this

1189
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:03,460
is one style of machine learning but you

1190
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:05,019
know for example these other correlation

1191
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,450
techniques that we use to detect the

1192
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:08,890
communities you know those are in some

1193
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,879
way usable for a kind of time

1194
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:13,930
correlation or identifying communities

1195
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,089
that are actually carrying out a

1196
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:19,118
concerted attack maybe through several

1197
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:21,460
different assh sessions which is as I

1198
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,170
understand not really possible right now

1199
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,349
with the current approach but maybe you

1200
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:28,809
have some comment about how this could

1201
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:29,859
this could connect or or be extended

1202
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:34,210
even though it's a very very different

1203
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:35,710
tool no I think I think to if you want

1204
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,869
to do cyber defense today you need to

1205
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,329
have a lot of sensors a lot of

1206
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:42,609
monitoring systems and it's also all

1207
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:44,160
about data fusion and trying to combine

1208
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:46,630
information from many different sources

1209
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,220
so what I present today about Black

1210
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:49,750
Widow is basically monitoring the dark

1211
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,868
web which could be an interesting data

1212
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,269
source to find some data that is leaked

1213
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:57,609
or vulnerabilities but then you will of

1214
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:59,618
also maybe your honey pots that are

1215
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,750
there and then they will also collect

1216
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:04,079
information about what occurs trends are

1217
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:07,480
going on then you will also have your

1218
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,460
security monitoring systems one of it

1219
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,880
could be what appears presented

1220
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:15,130
monitoring the SSH activity and and

1221
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,609
basically you have to come up with all

1222
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:21,809
this information and try to make sense

1223
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:24,130
out of it and see fuse it and basically

1224
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:25,599
exploit everything you have so I think

1225
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,400
that's that's the way out to go so it's

1226
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,589
not possible to have one approach and

1227
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,309
focus on it and it but we have we really

1228
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:35,470
need to take all the opportunities open

1229
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:39,119
source information information from our

1230
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,779
own security systems and try to build

1231
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,940
intelligence out of it

1232
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:45,849
I think that's the the way to go in the

1233
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,799
future indeed indeed and I entirely

1234
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:50,619
agree with Vincent in my job we have our

1235
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:52,450
sock and during my day job I tried to

1236
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,030
enrich the data that our analysts

1237
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:55,160
received

1238
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:56,600
so with open-source intelligence with

1239
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,609
any help that we can provide them to

1240
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,490
help them solve cases faster because in

1241
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,990
the end that's what the main performance

1242
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,970
you want to improve with your security

1243
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:06,229
analyst it's how many cases then they

1244
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,910
can solve because the number of cases

1245
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,740
will only increase with number of

1246
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:12,170
clients that you have so you really have

1247
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,509
to improve your the performance of your

1248
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:17,210
analyst by helping them with open source

1249
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,940
or data from the dark web that can tell

1250
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,740
you look today we saw in our dark web

1251
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:25,430
analysis that they are talking about

1252
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:28,209
this recent exploits or for example in

1253
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,169
enhancing we saw those commands we can

1254
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,540
infer with the help of a machine

1255
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:34,100
learning tool that is probably malicious

1256
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,520
because we already saw that previously

1257
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:39,950
indeed indeed okay and then one last

1258
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,920
question if I can direct this at you you

1259
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,600
appear so of course many of these

1260
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,190
techniques in engrams are taken from

1261
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,170
computational linguistics natural

1262
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:50,690
language of processing and you may know

1263
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:53,150
that over in that that world there also

1264
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:56,240
approaches with where the N is not fixed

1265
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:58,040
so you have a dynamic dynamically sized

1266
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,700
window for the generation of these

1267
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Ingram's

1268
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,680
have you thought about using that it

1269
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,690
that's a potential solution to the fact

1270
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,569
that you know the attacker can flood

1271
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:10,250
things and then make use a larger end to

1272
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:12,620
the detriment of the system as well so a

1273
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:15,140
kind of elastic approach to this might

1274
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,940
be yes sorry I wasn't entirely clear

1275
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,920
with this but yeah we're not using just

1276
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,780
the one grams or two grams

1277
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,910
we're using a combination of those so if

1278
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,280
we say right we take for example up to

1279
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:28,700
three so one grams to grams three grams

1280
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,530
right right very nice because you had

1281
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,990
the different sizes influence on what

1282
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:34,520
information is put in advance with the

1283
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,740
one gram you would see which program is

1284
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,690
used often exactly it's a three or more

1285
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,419
grams you would see previous and next

1286
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:44,330
commands which are grouped together

1287
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:46,100
indeed so Java I'd like to just thank

1288
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,060
you for tying it all together very much

1289
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,680
appreciated

1290
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,440
vincent and b are also very much

1291
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,720
appreciated for your your technical

1292
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,600
contributions leading up to that and i

1293
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,640
have also the speakers gifts if i can

1294
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,160
give those to you and will thank them in

1295
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,879
just a moment

1296
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,879
thank you
