1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,460
so we should sit here right and talk

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,940
we'll be in English okay I'm just like

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,309
want to be sure that if it's in English

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,120
then most probably don't have any

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:22,500
government members here in the audience

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:26,729
like so but yeah thanks for having us

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,970
I think one of the most important things

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,989
what was not introduced about you Alan

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,089
is also there was a grand old man of a

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,680
stainless startup community so you still

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,950
remember those times where all those

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,379
very startups were born like so we

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,660
should start from somewhere like a no

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,099
first question for you like as we do it

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,379
in a file chat mode like why you think

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
that we have this digit Society in

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,800
Estonia what is the reason

18
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,468
first of all good morning and thanks

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Tommy calling me grant old man I'm

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,729
trying to escape that but like not not

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,330
escaping anymore so welcome to Estonia

22
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,340
and the stone is is of course it has so

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,899
many different faces and so many

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,220
different names but one of summer know

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,500
without any doubt this that this is a

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,150
startup country and it's one of the most

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,490
successful startup countries not down in

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,799
Europe but and nowadays also all over

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,979
the world so giving you a few numbers

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,049
and we last year had like a record year

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,929
of venture capital coming into stone in

32
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,180
companies and it was more than 350

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,369
million euros and that's in a country of

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,140
1.3 million people so now if you do the

35
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,110
math and divide it onto a per capita

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,700
basis so we're pretty much on the level

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,850
of United States and Israel which are

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,149
considered to be the leaders of startup

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,289
and world and technology industries and

40
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,210
we have literally hundreds of different

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,460
startups and as they are popping up in

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,500
each year but they're also superstars

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,380
with this country has given birth the

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,880
fall for what is called unicorns or tech

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,229
companies having more than 1 billion

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,880
dollars euros whatever evaluation and

47
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,220
Skype obviously from old days was when

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,878
the Maeby's most known but we also have

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,040
and transferwise which is an a leader in

50
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,230
money transfers so now we have

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,239
at AXA fire or knowledge is called bolt

52
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,099
which is like an alternative to uber

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,379
also have a company called Playtech

54
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,839
which is like a partly Stoneham partly

55
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,689
Israeli but has development here listed

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,269
in London doing online gambling software

57
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,239
so like all flavors but them well in

58
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,159
general this country has thousands and

59
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,140
at this point probably close to ten

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,888
thousand people involved in in start-up

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,559
industries and it is growing very fast I

62
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,000
would say about like a headcount you

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,189
know start of industries it is growing

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,560
about twenty five percent per year most

65
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,689
of those people are nowadays coming from

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,760
outside of Estonia like in or many of

67
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,590
them at least and it's about like one

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,470
quarter of people in stone in start-up

69
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,329
industry say i express already so and

70
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,819
this it's quite quite different like if

71
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,950
you take like UK if you take Silicon

72
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,720
Valley to take Germany so I'm looking on

73
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,238
the startups and the percentage of

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,510
non-local people is considerably lower

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,730
and it's really interesting phenomenon

76
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,970
and then let's maybe discuss why Estonia

77
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,978
has reached a situation so no W have

78
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,540
been seeing it yourself as well so what

79
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:26,190
are the roots of Estonia being

80
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:30,599
successful in Dec I mean it's very

81
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:34,859
important to mention that when we talk

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,750
about digital society we should point

83
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,940
out it's not teach the government the

84
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,470
teacher societies actually government

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,319
sector working together the private

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,970
sector and the innovations that happens

87
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,679
in a private sector should be accepted

88
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,750
by the government and vice-versa

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,430
only then you can can build a proper

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,069
like this a society I think that's a

91
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,530
biggest problem what you have like

92
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,078
invest in European or like best in

93
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,049
countries that you see private sector

94
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,459
developing super rapidly but you don't

95
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,250
see government accepting the same

96
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,799
changes so for example data exchange

97
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,379
happening between companies it's quite

98
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,930
normal in in in private sectors but not

99
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,840
in not in too many countries but we were

100
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,519
lucky do you have the same problem what

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,130
Sweden and Finland and other Nordic

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,200
countries have it is that we have a huge

103
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,710
amount of land but not too many people

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,849
so outside of the capital if you want to

105
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,979
be efficient you

106
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,900
cannot afford a bank office in every

107
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,670
small town if you have like four or five

108
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,419
transactions per day there is no point

109
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,640
to keep a clerk like behind this it was

110
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,470
clear let's already 20 years ago that if

111
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,150
you want to be efficient in this country

112
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,530
you need to push people to use the

113
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,739
Knology and to build that stay in there

114
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,989
I didn't have like money meaning like we

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,420
couldn't afford McKinsey or exchanger or

116
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,790
like other big players so we had to

117
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,280
relay significantly on other local

118
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,940
resources which means that those people

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,369
got skills and like building something

120
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,800
let's say our ID card initiative I

121
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,170
wasn't in each initiative it came from

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,790
the private sector they like it said

123
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,490
that basically solved the question who

124
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,900
is behind the device and let's solve it

125
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,040
together like private sector together

126
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,450
the government or wise first like the

127
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,280
government introduced like new

128
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,170
initiatives like give residents say the

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,820
private sector like takes it and tries

130
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,650
to build business out of that so it has

131
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,620
always been together so it's not like

132
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,700
ego vermin I mean there's no such thing

133
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,850
like the government there is digital

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,890
society or nothing so and I think that's

135
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,960
like coughing why why we have been

136
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,200
successful similarly the other Nordic

137
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,330
countries maybe one observation from my

138
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,219
aunt is that Estonia always because of a

139
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,620
small size and I also always has had

140
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,950
some sort of like hacker mentality when

141
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,510
it comes to also doing government

142
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,130
affairs and to bring you an example

143
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,830
now you may tell me remember that I

144
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,800
think it was here like mid 2000 early

145
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,300
2007 when Estonian

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,070
Minister cabinet Minister Prime Minister

147
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,920
office was moving to a new building now

148
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,300
called Steinbach building and I got the

149
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
call I was CEO of the largest IT

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,630
services company in the country at that

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,280
time I got a call from advisor to Prime

152
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,600
Minister and saying hey we are moving in

153
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,520
one month since the Prime Minister wants

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,440
to makes a cabinet meeting in paperless

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,180
and we have one month so actually for

156
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,590
three weeks and we have 20,000 euros

157
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,450
because otherwise we need to declare a

158
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,750
government tender so can you do it and

159
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,950
this video I can in three weeks time the

160
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,570
cabinet meeting in the meetings were

161
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,940
equipped with a big document management

162
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,450
system when every cabinet minister was

163
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,510
able to participate online worldwide so

164
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,469
we read it for 20,000 euros so and like

165
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,330
is this

166
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,150
cabinet meeting room was actually show

167
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,010
to everything and head of state and it

168
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,520
became entrepreneur trademark of the

169
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,890
country so next tour in Latvia so they

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,299
basically has the same project and like

171
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,740
I'd left their soul but she's also

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,830
looking Estonia and saying hey me needs

173
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,210
the same so and it because our company

174
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,979
is also represented in that via so it

175
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,690
has a multi-million dollar project and

176
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,460
it took significantly more time so

177
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,140
everything almost everything in Estonia

178
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,729
here legacy if you take a tax like

179
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,200
everybody to Claire's taxes here online

180
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,560
it takes about two minutes to do your

181
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,500
national income declaration so IRA's it

182
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,640
in C and so on so say I kind of hacked

183
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,800
quickly together so say usually isn't

184
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,690
made into small projects and which can

185
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,760
be like done in in months or maybe like

186
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,730
the maximum a year it was a really low

187
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,130
in budget and they just happen and

188
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,900
usually sensitive comes from from bottom

189
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,969
up not top down it's actually

190
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,669
interesting observation that the point

191
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:40,800
is that after three successful reforms

192
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,200
people start to demand more like and

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,150
they don't care what it is but you have

194
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,640
to deliver and if you don't deliver they

195
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,500
start to say that Tiger is sleeping and

196
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,570
there is no innovation in our country

197
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,250
anymore and and you look around like

198
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,159
what you say I mean like there's no

199
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,650
innovation like it's it's like all kind

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,410
of innovation there but I have to salute

201
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,960
to our politicians because through the

202
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,840
history they have trusted engineers so

203
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,760
if engineers say that ok this will be

204
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,849
already curry foreman and it takes more

205
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,860
time it takes like a couple of Jose

206
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,190
boning cycles or like covering cycles

207
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,950
just wait I mean the pieces will come

208
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,650
together that they have listened I mean

209
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,169
our data exchanges platform started to

210
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,880
work basically seven years after the

211
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,890
first implementation already caught the

212
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,860
same thing I mean if we want to change

213
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:35,460
society that the change takes like six

214
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,300
up to nine years and like our government

215
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,919
has has like had this so said trust or

216
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,109
believe that there's no point to cancer

217
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,060
project let's let's let's keep time to

218
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,370
mature and and this is a huge thing I

219
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,510
mean Australia has tried to do the

220
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,580
dishes lied in it twice both times they

221
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,089
have rolled it back because it takes

222
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,689
more than

223
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,670
one voting size table let's talk out of

224
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:01,589
it urgency so you are usually called the

225
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,199
father of irritancy so your father of

226
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,839
many children but they didn't seem happy

227
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,998
most famous of some so how many in this

228
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,339
audience actually knows what irritancy

229
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:17,579
means five six not too many so Bobby

230
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:21,120
what is it and well one thing why I

231
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,829
actually wanted to become actually the I

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,249
didn't want to become CIO by the way I

233
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,920
accepted the CIO position was that the

234
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:31,829
government promised that doesn't matter

235
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,809
how crazy ideas you have like we at

236
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:38,339
least consider them and if they make

237
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:39,899
sense we will do it and it's an

238
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,639
interesting that when the country

239
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,959
becomes digital like the whole country

240
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,600
the private sector together with

241
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,268
government you need you will start

242
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,759
seeing like new trends happening in

243
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,790
society so for example if everything is

244
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,980
digital if everything is paperless like

245
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,349
the meaning of location the physical

246
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,379
presence is not so important anymore so

247
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,189
I now mostly work in India to induced in

248
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:07,170
India and still learn at the same time I

249
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,939
have business in Estonia and I'm fully

250
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,349
in charge of those businesses even

251
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:13,889
though I'm actually working more than

252
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,050
6000 kilometers away so and then the

253
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,920
whole society for example accepts teach

254
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,059
teach and signature and like but 95

255
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,420
percent of the contracts and everything

256
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,199
is he sent digitally you start to

257
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,939
understand that you actually can connect

258
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,740
my not only Estonians with this kind of

259
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:34,649
society but you can basically offer the

260
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,240
same service to to anybody so actually

261
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,699
that's an interesting trend I've if you

262
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,870
have noticed then you can get an MIT

263
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:44,969
degree nowadays without visiting us us I

264
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,730
mean you participate in internet courses

265
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,759
you do the exams and like you don't have

266
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,259
to physically be there it's possible you

267
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,779
see the same kind of trend in healthcare

268
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,149
I mean like if there is a better doctor

269
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,850
in Switzerland in that particular

270
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,429
illness you have like you go there so

271
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,069
like like certain areas that has been

272
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,600
monopoly of the countries like education

273
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:12,399
business ecosystem

274
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,889
this healthcare etc I mean it won't be

275
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,120
monopoly any more in future and what we

276
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,310
noticed is that there is a new trend in

277
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,100
the world called teach the nomads or

278
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,920
people who travel a lot who spend like

279
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,930
three years in three months in Bali four

280
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,630
months in you okay another four months

281
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,459
in us then Canada then back to Bali

282
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:39,040
so who serves those kind of people and

283
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,349
like that was one of the motivations

284
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,529
like how can we connect more people with

285
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,089
Eastern economy in a way that the taxis

286
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,560
are still paid in a country where

287
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,480
they're located and even more

288
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,819
interesting if you are in the different

289
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,079
countries can we actually solve the text

290
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,750
question in a way that all those

291
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:59,199
countries get something so that math is

292
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:02,410
not there yet but that was the ideology

293
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:04,990
behind it but now you serve them so you

294
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:08,050
can tell like what kind of people are

295
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,790
using Aston and digital citizenship yeah

296
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,560
so first of all it's not the citizenship

297
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,599
as you know it residency shorten there

298
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,670
about maybe sixty thousand people who

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,170
have got it residency close to sixty

300
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,509
thousand days yeah I remember oddly and

301
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,699
to say have set about 6,000 plus

302
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:24,189
companies and I have set up to the

303
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,490
second plus company in Estonia and the

304
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:28,899
leap in my company serves about maybe

305
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,459
forty percent of them so basically they

306
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,630
running on our platform when it comes to

307
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,800
accounting so we help them to

308
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,230
incorporate they can actually

309
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,040
incorporate the company on our platform

310
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,540
so and like in it you ever sink and what

311
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,550
they need without leaving our

312
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,740
environment and that's the beauty

313
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,758
because you know like Estonian

314
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,980
government has actually built

315
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,870
api's and we have built the government

316
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,550
interface and that's actually I believe

317
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,839
how it should be in the government so

318
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,519
it's not the government stars to build

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,529
user interfaces for for interaction

320
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,649
waste like customers or citizens or

321
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,389
companies so the government must build

322
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,860
processes and regulations and api's and

323
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,689
as a private company it will be

324
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,449
significantly better in in putting

325
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,189
together interfaces so for like

326
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,810
different types of companies different

327
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:15,610
people's they will look better they will

328
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,500
work better and so forth so without

329
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,019
losing functionality and still being

330
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,340
safe and that's pretty much what

331
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,020
Philippe in is doing so we

332
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,390
are the government interface for

333
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,819
irritants if they want to operate

334
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,680
restone in companies and our long-term

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,620
vision is actually to be the interface

336
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,459
not between only Estonian country as a

337
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,530
platform and the customers but also

338
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,800
pretty much any other country that is

339
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,750
ready for that task so we are we see the

340
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,459
world like the government's are like if

341
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,560
you remember like the years ago

342
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,150
everybody had a server in the corner so

343
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,979
today we're running everything on Amazon

344
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,630
Web Services and we don't know worry and

345
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,220
care versus server is actually in

346
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,650
Ireland or in the United States

347
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,990
so same way and we see the word coming

348
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,850
forward so the we are announcing about

349
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,210
services and the countries as a physical

350
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,070
server summer

351
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,200
businesses and an interaction with a

352
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,090
platform will be detached from from

353
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,730
physical countries so it takes our

354
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,910
interest in fact that when we develop

355
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,340
the residency that'd be so mostly people

356
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,260
outside of European Union doing business

357
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,820
with Europe so it makes sense I mean

358
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,290
like you outside let's say you're Indian

359
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,420
in India you want to sell your services

360
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,939
in Europe you want European presence

361
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,469
like here is your access point basically

362
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,530
and then suddenly like a huge part of

363
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,720
Germans start to come and apply for a

364
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,360
residency and we are like no what

365
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,100
happened I mean Germany like you are

366
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,140
inside of European Union right actually

367
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,080
you are the European Union because

368
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,090
without you nothing happens so you are

369
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,160
inside you of eurozone so why the hell

370
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,530
you need a stay in any residency what's

371
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,750
the benefit and then their answer was

372
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,120
very simple like running a like one-man

373
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,270
company in in Germany is extremely

374
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,700
protracted and expensive in Estonia by

375
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,230
let's a bit leap in you pay 75 euros per

376
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,420
month and you don't need to do any

377
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,010
reporting and like nothing everything

378
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,290
runs smoothly and that's the service you

379
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,140
want to buy and that's what we see I

380
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,050
mean like you don't buy CDs anymore you

381
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,100
use poly for your SoundCloud you pay

382
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,400
$6.99 and you have the whole music in

383
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,700
the world so everything becomes like say

384
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,680
if it's like efficient it's just across

385
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,300
the fixed effective it's easy to use

386
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,729
people to look you for it and they don't

387
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,910
care I mean you don't think that like if

388
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,050
I use Spotify how it Sweden like or like

389
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,600
if I Drive ruber

390
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,829
the money transfer platform comes from

391
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,190
Netherlands like you don't think this

392
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,779
way so so and that's what will happen

393
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,220
and what Estonia has proved the

394
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,380
residents I think that most of the

395
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,730
countries you don't have to be worried

396
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:54,189
about Estonian providing the service but

397
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,140
today is observing different countries

398
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,520
all over the world basically China is

399
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,140
able to do the same kind of thing if

400
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,370
they would love to like to do the same

401
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,860
thing they could do it tomorrow

402
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,080
now make know other countries is near to

403
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,820
that but but China could do it and if

404
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,950
they would offer access to Chinese

405
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,529
market access to the Chinese different

406
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,500
services like Alibaba etc if they truly

407
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,260
would like to do that together I mean

408
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,089
that might be boring thing for for us

409
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,209
for Germany for for other countries

410
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,760
because if your why and third generation

411
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:27,250
will do the company they will start a

412
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,680
company where it's convenient not

413
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,510
because I am like pretty so it has to be

414
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,380
a British company like no I will do it

415
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,080
where it's convenient

416
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,029
and if it's outside from somewhere else

417
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,850
your echo system actually will have a

418
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,829
big hit because if you have a business

419
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,060
in like I'd say in China case you also

420
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:45,219
have will have a bank account there etc

421
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,069
so the echo system will that you will

422
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,200
use also it's outside from from your

423
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,779
country so those are interesting trends

424
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,040
and I'm glad that like our country has

425
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:59,260
been able and willing to observe them we

426
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,750
can give you deeper studies if you want

427
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,929
to understand all those those trends in

428
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,300
more detail I'm looking at the clock so

429
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,819
we have plus three minutes so we can't

430
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,948
talk about interesting stuff like theyd

431
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:15,459
embassy and country in the cloud stuff I

432
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,280
mean we have to come again but the

433
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,949
meaning of the state it changes so

434
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,720
historic it has been location land

435
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:28,809
people in future it will be basically

436
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,080
how you feel here I mean there are like

437
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,360
like country of Israel and Jews I mean

438
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,850
like the nations revive thousands of

439
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,770
years without country because here they

440
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,590
felt in the same way or you take the

441
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,100
negative example like Isis like where is

442
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,199
the country Libya Syria London so it

443
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,178
becomes like more how you feel here but

444
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,940
my Catalonians had the problem I still

445
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:56,779
have they came here to study like can

446
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,999
they rent country in the cloud so those

447
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:00,409
are interesting trends and we have a new

448
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:03,019
design another session to talk about it

449
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,909
but your closing remarks yeah well it's

450
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:11,749
the two minutes left there any question

451
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:13,190
from the audience in perhaps no ok if

452
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:15,950
not in this case maybe it's still less

453
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,970
spend sauce two minutes do you do

454
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,320
something useful

455
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,059
let's pick about security we're on

456
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,710
security conference so Estonia see

457
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,389
government actually runs on some new

458
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,519
principles first of all the digital

459
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:27,408
identity is mandatory if people are

460
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,179
getting the digital ID cards and you

461
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,919
can't really escape with it like you

462
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,359
have a personal code from birth and you

463
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,859
can't escape it like in many other

464
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,168
countries it's like a very controversial

465
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:38,539
issue so secondly you control your data

466
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,070
like in any government of no government

467
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,879
official can just go and look at your

468
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,129
data so it will leave a mark somewhere

469
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:48,019
on a government portal and you can see

470
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:49,908
who has looked up their data so the

471
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,169
government can't ask you data twice like

472
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,940
if they've got one government branch

473
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,950
know something about you another branch

474
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,480
can't ask which means that if you are

475
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,859
feeling a document and like the

476
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,629
government must already know for example

477
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:01,639
something about you it's actually better

478
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:03,109
that it also means that certain

479
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:05,029
information is collected only once

480
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,830
because I and stored only once so you

481
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,659
don't have the same day then in topical

482
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,720
locations so it's easier to protect that

483
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:14,600
ok and now Dhabi is a security concern

484
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,609
like an if it's like only kept once like

485
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,359
you you can kill it once and then it's

486
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:22,999
gone or is it good so no no I mean I

487
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,559
already noticed there are experts in the

488
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,470
audience who are way better like to

489
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,749
comment on this but so quite simple I

490
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,179
mean if you need to protect system like

491
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,429
if you tear the a bunch of data into

492
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:36,409
small parts even if you lose one small

493
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:38,419
part it doesn't affect the whole system

494
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,639
that's one thing if you don't duplicate

495
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,909
the same data in multiple locations it's

496
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:47,238
also easy to protect that because let's

497
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:50,629
say population registry invest a lot to

498
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:52,340
cyber security but what if the minister

499
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:54,769
of agriculture for example collects the

500
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,869
same data and it's not so careful so

501
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,940
what the investment in population

502
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,360
registry is basically pointless if the

503
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,860
whole part like don't don't do

504
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,928
same kind of security but that's why

505
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,120
Estonian system is so unique I mean if

506
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:10,450
something that is there in a population

507
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,399
registry others can request the data but

508
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,470
they can't store it to themselves so

509
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,750
it's it becomes like yeah I like the

510
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,309
architecture but I said and I noticed

511
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,010
there was some people who actually built

512
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,549
that so in the audience so you can ask

513
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,680
from them

514
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:32,219
good so our time is up Thanks

515
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,219
[Applause]
