1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,279
okay I guess that we could start with

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,660
our session scheduled at 11:00

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,230
related to the new track operations I

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,629
can't ask you to close with the door in

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,449
order to reduce a bit noise here and

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,140
starting on time and to avoid stealing

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,689
time to our speakers so good morning and

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,449
welcome everybody and the Italian Navy

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,720
Commander Stefano Biondi I have been

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,309
working here the CCDC since three years

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,790
as a cyber intelligence researcher and

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:39,449
today host for this panel darkweb any

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,710
impulse for military operations so far

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,399
we had the opportunity to attend panels

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,100
related to cyber domain from different

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,670
perspectives the sadeghi' vision rather

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,800
than the legal implications or even the

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,590
technical challenges and opportunities

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,099
but we are definitely missing a pillar

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,500
operations yesterday we had a good talk

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,600
in the afternoon with General Petraeus

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,630
and dr. Lynn focus on cyber operations

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,720
and information operations today we are

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,720
going to continue on this track and we

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,929
will have three panels operations

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,509
oriented the first one this one focus on

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,090
dark web and in the afternoon we're

28
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,210
gonna have other two panels always for

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,630
topics related to operations the first

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,600
will be social network analysis and

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,270
information warfare oriented and the

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,908
third one related to the implication of

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,200
use of artificial intelligence the

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,229
optimization of artificial intelligence

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,430
within military systems but back to our

36
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:55,110
panel today

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,740
now we perfectly know that in the

38
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,750
military domain one of the main topic

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,380
one of the main constraint is the

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,079
collection Gallery gathering information

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,190
good information is a must in order to

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,359
plan operations and to fill the gap to

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,790
plan these

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,970
these operations and to get a good

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:22,049
situation awareness picture so today

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,440
with this session we will try to focus

47
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,410
on this kind of considerations and the

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,320
session itself will provide some insight

49
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,030
into discovery of possible tracks for

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,329
military operation within the dark web

51
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,080
and discussing feasible weaknesses in

52
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,690
this hidden area and identify possible

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,570
solutions to mitigate the risks

54
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,079
connected to with military operations

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,540
and from the Intel perspective trying to

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,390
understand if dark web is a good source

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:01,140
for Intel purposes military intelligence

58
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:06,029
so of course for achieving all these

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:09,920
kind of questions I will not be alone on

60
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,280
the stage with me from left right

61
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,399
commander dr. Robert Koch from the

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,920
Bundeswehr cyber security center dr.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Andre melegari from expert system and

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,109
mr. John Green up from the NATO

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,620
intelligence fusion center before

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,390
starting with with the talks a quick

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,360
remark about the organization of this

68
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,730
panel we're gonna have three talks 20

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,370
minutes each and in the end of each

70
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,869
speech we're gonna have 5-10 minutes

71
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,940
question time for each of our experts

72
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,430
here so let's try to maximize the

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,720
opportunity you have those brilliant

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:55,230
experts here on the stage with us today

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:04:02,420
and try to write questions intelligence

76
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:05,579
and operations oriented so just a quick

77
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,950
information about the panel itself this

78
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,310
panel has been thought to enlarge the

79
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:15,420
vision of some questions that have been

80
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:19,108
written in paper that has been selected

81
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,149
for our proceeding and you gonna have

82
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,150
the the presenting book in your welcome

83
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,370
package and these are

84
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,969
and of course this paper is in this book

85
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:34,310
the author of these paper is a commander

86
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,280
Robert Koch and today is with us to

87
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:41,490
provide the contents of this document of

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,219
this research and outcomes that he got

89
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,740
in the end of this research Robert is a

90
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,720
general staff officer of the federal

91
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,030
armed forces and senior research

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,760
assistant and lecturer in computer

93
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,609
science at the University at the

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,030
Bundeswehr and unity of bond

95
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,130
main area of interest for Robert system

96
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,609
security intrusion detection in encrypt

97
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,740
networks and artificial intelligence the

98
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,919
title of the paper and this presentation

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,810
of course hidden in the shadow the dark

100
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,109
web a growing risk for military

101
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,720
operations the paper analyzes the

102
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,720
technical base of the dark web and the

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,419
exam is the possibilities to dynamic the

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,789
of the organization driving a discussion

105
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,539
of the potential risk for military

106
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,690
operations

107
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,640
so please rubber floor is yours thank

108
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,200
you very much dear ladies and gentlemen

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,550
[Applause]

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,110
when you're thinking about the dark web

111
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,919
you often have these typically pictures

112
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,510
in the mind

113
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:48,000
for example the trading was rocks in

114
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,650
respective markets selling of guns and

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,360
for example we had during the Munich

116
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,359
shootings a few years ago also the

117
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,900
information that used weapon was also

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,849
bought via the dark web so typically

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,690
very bad nessing's

120
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:11,280
also playpen was a very famous example

121
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:14,130
when in 2015 the FBI took down that

122
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,669
webpage which contained a lot of child

123
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,780
pornography after two years from 2017

124
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,490
the statistics nearly 600 arrests

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,780
corresponding with that takedown of the

126
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,470
birth page but before talking about the

127
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,179
dark web in some more detail we have to

128
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,919
have a look at the definitions because a

129
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,770
lot of things are very often mixed in

130
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,068
that area

131
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,900
so the clear net is everything you can

132
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,539
reach with your normal browser and you

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,979
are doing a Google or a bin search

134
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,219
everything these engines these crawlers

135
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:51,880
can find the Deep Web that's much much

136
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,710
bigger than the actual unit everything

137
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,650
that is connected to the Internet think

138
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,859
for example about your intranet at your

139
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,440
company and some private data at home of

140
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,960
your computers and stuff like that so

141
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,750
normally that should be inaccessible by

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,060
a search engine normally of course so

143
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,370
that's a Deep Web the darknet very often

144
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,460
mixed with a dark web the darknet are

145
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,979
the IP addresses out there which are

146
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,318
routable but not in use so your computer

147
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,289
needs IP addresses to send the messages

148
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,819
through the internet and some of these

149
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:28,840
addresses are not induced

150
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:31,870
and these usable but not in use these

151
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,568
are building the dark net and the dark

152
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,819
web finally that are the websites which

153
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,250
are hosted within so called overlay

154
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,919
networks so a specific structure on top

155
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,659
of the Internet which is normally only

156
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,990
accessible by using special software

157
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:50,789
like for example datura also the size is

158
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,320
quite interesting tor is the most famous

159
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,150
dark web which is available there are

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,680
some more but that's the most famous and

161
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,799
the biggest one and if you have a look

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,740
to the numbers about a timeline of two

163
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,270
years you can see ok maybe about 50,000

164
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:10,750
pages going up recently - about 100,000

165
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,349
in average you can also identify some

166
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,110
very sharp increases and the numbers

167
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,240
here in the beginning only for a one

168
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,360
short time and then to plateaus for a

169
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,180
longer time that quite off means that

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,000
not a hundred thousand guys are putting

171
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,599
a new content of the web to the exactly

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,208
same time but that some nasty is going

173
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,630
on some attack is happening the network

174
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,119
is and the heavies away and so maybe a

175
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,789
research institute or a agency is trying

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,630
to do something more or maybe someone is

177
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,370
using the infrastructure to do attacks

178
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,120
and therefore registry

179
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,760
new onion domains in fact the dark web

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,040
itself as you can see is quite small and

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,040
I put the numbers to the graph over

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,319
there and you see the clear net some of

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,870
the stuff you can browse in red and the

184
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,850
dark web in blue and it's in blue but

185
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,580
the resolution of the Beamer is too low

186
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,950
so you can't see the small part of it so

187
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,140
I give you the numbers in January this

188
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,970
year that Leigh Annette has about 1.9

189
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,199
billion websites the dark web has about

190
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,070
105,000 and they are not with content

191
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:29,140
maybe half of it so the dark web is only

192
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:33,190
about 0.005 of the amount of web pages

193
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:36,040
out there so it's really really small so

194
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,360
actually you have that tip of the

195
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,459
iceberg and you should flip that iceberg

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,000
also interesting a lot of bad things is

197
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,750
going on there but a lot of good police

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,460
work is done so on a regular base

199
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,010
illegal services are shot down of one

200
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,630
example the Hansa Bay that was the

201
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,020
screen shot when the market was closed

202
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,820
down and I like the humor of our friends

203
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,180
from the Netherlands they did a great

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,000
job there so you can even access a link

205
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,489
with details about the arrests going on

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,620
and there are links to the courts a

207
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,840
trial so they are providing all the

208
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,300
information and sending out a clear

209
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,820
message hey we will catch you even if

210
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,729
you are working in the dark web and also

211
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,460
the identified bias a notice there so

212
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,470
giving a warning call don't do that any

213
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,550
longer so a lot of police work is going

214
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,360
on there so if we are thinking about

215
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:36,069
important and sensitive information

216
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,350
which may inflict military missions we

217
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,080
really have to think about how secure as

218
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:46,260
a dark web would you really use such a

219
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:49,750
mean to do actions that may inflict

220
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:54,790
military operations so first I will give

221
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,720
you a very very short look how toys

222
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,849
working

223
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,250
so in principle your computer is

224
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,510
selecting three other machines you know

225
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,520
all of them

226
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,400
and then you built encrypted channels to

227
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,189
everybody of these computers and then

228
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,650
you are sending messages to Sam and the

229
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,930
other guys only know the predecessor and

230
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:17,050
the successor so your computer knows all

231
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,670
but the other computers only know the

232
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,150
producer and British ass on the

233
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,819
successor so if a message is going in an

234
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,959
anonymized way out of the Tor network to

235
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,810
the regular Internet

236
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,150
the exit point the last computer in the

237
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,280
row knows only they address where it

238
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,380
should go in the Internet and where it's

239
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,329
coming from from the middle guy but not

240
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,810
more information so your IP address

241
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:45,010
system is faded out and nobody is able

242
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,680
to identify you on the other hand there

243
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,670
are a lot of possibilities to do some D

244
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,329
anonymization attacks three basic kinds

245
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,550
can be differentiated so the first one

246
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,160
is if you really have winner abilities

247
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,069
in tour itself so the software that

248
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,250
provides these overlay networks or

249
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,320
the respective protocol an important

250
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,610
example some time ago was the so called

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:16,600
relay or a traffic confirmation attack

252
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:19,930
that was a change in the protocol that

253
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,420
was necessary but there was some stuff

254
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,819
in there that you can exploit it to do

255
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,810
at the anonymous ation of the user that

256
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,540
was used in real life and as soon as it

257
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,910
was identified publicly it was fixed

258
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,760
these errors are quite rare but they

259
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,610
happen so errors in tour itself very

260
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,000
very dangerous if you are trying to get

261
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,010
a good anonymity also on a technical

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,980
base but not focusing on the Tor

263
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,950
software itself is winner abilities of

264
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,960
use software normally you are using the

265
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,700
Firefox browser to access the Tor

266
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,510
network you can trust downloaded and

267
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,640
started that's all so very easy and the

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,860
most attack vectors are going to that

269
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,580
additional software the browser browser

270
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,350
plugins so for example the FBI used a

271
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,160
technique they called network

272
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,590
investigative technique to identify some

273
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
users in fact that was quite funny

274
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,910
because

275
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,829
a very old exploit they used from a

276
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,199
meatus ployed service publicly available

277
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:26,258
but because nobody used it it was

278
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:29,679
already retired and at least it seems it

279
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,540
was useful in that area so basically it

280
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,730
was a flesh plug-in running in the

281
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,189
browser and you were able with that

282
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,449
little sheet of code over there to

283
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:41,219
identify the IP address of the user so

284
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:43,719
vulnerability of the browser

285
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,470
respectively a block in but not of the

286
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,730
Tor network itself the FBI that was a

287
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,399
playpen case used that attack took over

288
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,350
and the playpen web serve and the dark

289
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,149
web and was running it for certain days

290
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,329
to collect the IP addresses of the

291
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,879
visitors and after they finished they

292
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:06,099
had about eight thousand seven hundred

293
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,410
computers HEC in 120 countries so some

294
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,899
background information from the numbers

295
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,329
from the beginning another attack

296
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:16,029
possibility is very interesting only the

297
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,559
scheme here I think about you are

298
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,869
accessing the network and your

299
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,730
smartphone is on your table and we have

300
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:24,549
some stuff in the advertisement industry

301
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,790
that's called ultrasound cross device

302
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:31,629
tracking because they want to connect

303
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,929
all your devices to you you can nowadays

304
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,689
embed an sound file into an

305
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:39,999
advertisement that is inaudible for

306
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:42,189
human but it is played when you are

307
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:45,399
opening that advert advertisement and

308
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:48,540
it's unique for the computer the

309
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,670
advertisement is sent to so the idea is

310
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,189
you have the yet the sound is played you

311
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,439
can't hear it but your mobile phone is

312
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:59,049
on your table beside you the mobile

313
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:01,509
phone can hear it and it's sending back

314
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:03,759
that unique code to the server that

315
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,309
generated the code and the server knows

316
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,429
where it sent that code so it can

317
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:11,469
connect the two devices and normally you

318
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:14,740
are not analyzed with your smartphone so

319
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,049
your smartphone tells the IP address

320
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,990
that is used for accessing the internet

321
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:24,100
from home so a very very interesting

322
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,309
attack based on something which is an

323
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,420
indirect shortcoming but no direct

324
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:32,139
vulnerability

325
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:36,430
so of course human error and the my the

326
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:39,339
most often one very funny example one

327
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,870
truck dealer who used the dark web in

328
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:46,420
the United States was caught because

329
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,269
pulley the post offices get suspicious

330
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,420
that he put the passes all the time was

331
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:55,600
lytics clothes on to the post office not

332
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,699
to have the fingerprints on it and that

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,850
were they in front the police I checked

334
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:03,969
the guy and they identified okay he's

335
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,550
selling the UV drugs which he is dealing

336
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,829
over the dark web so human error is

337
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:13,990
definitely the most common era when the

338
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,050
anonymization is possible in the dark

339
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,750
web there are multiple other

340
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,540
opportunities for example only giving a

341
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,079
very light of it about that I did a

342
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,000
research running about 1.5 years

343
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:31,959
analyzing how the routing is working in

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,910
the in the dark web and how are the exit

345
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,880
nodes used if you are using it for the

346
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,130
info anonymous ation and as you can see

347
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,100
the blue part over there in the graph

348
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,380
that are exit nodes that are currently

349
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,740
used that means you have a very slow

350
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,990
number very low number only about 1,000

351
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,019
exit nodes in average in the dark web in

352
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:56,949
the in the Tor network and from these

353
00:16:53,019 --> 00:17:01,209
only a very limited part is used that

354
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:03,910
means if you want to survey these these

355
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:08,349
exit nodes it's quite easy you only have

356
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,299
to focus on a very limited number also

357
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,178
if you are thinking about the

358
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:16,780
capabilities of the NSA you will for

359
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:20,230
sure know the xkeyscore so the that are

360
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,780
definitions or for example IP addresses

361
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,910
or terms they are looking for in the

362
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,399
internet and if they can see that in the

363
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,690
traffic they are going into the

364
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,330
connection and you can do different

365
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,030
things and as you can see if you have a

366
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,580
look into the definitions as far as we

367
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,330
know from the leaks there for example

368
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,189
things like tails entails a distribution

369
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,800
which is enabling tour and

370
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,460
trying to give the maximum security to

371
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,800
enter into the ruse and total user so

372
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,320
everything that is going out of the

373
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,540
computer is routed through the Tor

374
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,419
network but first you have to download

375
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,580
the software and that rule that is

376
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,040
defined there is exactly looking if

377
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,860
someone is connecting to the website and

378
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,770
trying to download the software so if

379
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,540
you are able to intervene into that

380
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,720
connection during the download process

381
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:17,050
and for example to a rerouting and

382
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,300
giving another download version you can

383
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:23,440
have a compromise even already by the

384
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:26,530
download so a lot of possibilities to

385
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,780
attack the security and the anonymity of

386
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:34,120
the Tor web if we have a look at the

387
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,820
range of services and data we can see

388
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,949
there a lot of studies highlight that is

389
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,770
a very large proportion of illicit

390
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,400
activities for examples number 44

391
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,710
percent of 57 percent or very shocking

392
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,320
numbers one research some time ago

393
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,290
presented that 80 percent of the traffic

394
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,340
in the dark web is related to try

395
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:59,680
pornography these this and these

396
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,730
estimations are really difficult to mate

397
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,760
in real world so measurements which are

398
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,880
used to get these ideas they are not

399
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,760
possible in a direct way only in

400
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,100
indirect means and you really have to

401
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,470
think about how are the hidden service

402
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,590
director is working so for example a

403
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:23,850
request that is quite rare will produce

404
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:26,949
more traffic than a request that is

405
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:30,370
provided very often to the service

406
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,000
directories that is often not handled

407
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,739
the right way in these evaluations

408
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,620
another aspect may be missed in some of

409
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,860
these works is there are a lot of drol

410
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,929
as law enforcement agencies try

411
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,179
protection agencies who are also

412
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,840
crawling the web and generating traffic

413
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:53,020
and the f1 it's quite difficult to say

414
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,959
that really such high amount is really

415
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,850
an illicit and traffic part

416
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,369
I have some statistics over there from

417
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,259
the internet watch foundation um they

418
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:04,649
are going through the web the clear net

419
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:08,769
and the dark web and trying to bring

420
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:11,649
down as many URLs would try pornography

421
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:14,409
as possible and you see the numbers the

422
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,820
URLs over there that is in the clear net

423
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,190
and the dark web

424
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,100
the percentage they found there is very

425
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,409
little a zero point something percent so

426
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,980
again these numbers are very very

427
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:31,779
limited while most of the stuff is just

428
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:34,269
in the clear net and interesting to know

429
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:36,669
one of the most active hidden services

430
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,769
at all if the Facebook web page so you

431
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:42,100
can access Facebook as an anonymous

432
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:46,539
service - and that's this one with the

433
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,009
most traffic in the dark web at all the

434
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,740
trading amounts in the dark web Hank

435
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,320
white can be quite high five hundred

436
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,539
thousand dollars a day and even more and

437
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,749
that's mainly for drugs and financial

438
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:00,669
fraud we can also identify and it's more

439
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:03,730
important when thinking about military

440
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:06,429
missions again personally identifiable

441
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,379
information and there are some analysis

442
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,659
out there which identified that the

443
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,019
largest footprint generated by these

444
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:17,679
personal identifiable information is for

445
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:20,740
the US Navy US Army and groups that are

446
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,499
closely linked to the defense area so

447
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,309
maybe dangerous and of course there are

448
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:29,440
other services offered for example more

449
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,840
web frameworks or crime as a service

450
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,269
will just pay some money to some guys

451
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,340
and they will hack a website for you and

452
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:40,210
things like that that's all possible

453
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:43,570
definitely if you have a closer look to

454
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,299
the data we can identify that some

455
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,029
confidential data is in there

456
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:52,450
normally the classification level is not

457
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:54,220
too high but it can be interesting data

458
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,779
there are some time sensitive

459
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,110
information available on different

460
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:01,840
projects or investigations but typically

461
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,740
from random hacks or leaks so if you

462
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,809
want to take or find information to

463
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,490
target a specific operation that may be

464
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,250
quite difficult

465
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:15,670
because the normal data is yeah more

466
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:19,270
random and not useful for that also

467
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:22,330
things like system access and access

468
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:26,410
credentials we can find that in the dark

469
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:29,350
web too to buy it but also yeah on a

470
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:32,470
very random base so it's quite difficult

471
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:36,399
to say okay I have the network X and I

472
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,630
need access credentials for that you can

473
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,559
only try to engage a hacker that is

474
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:48,309
doing that one things like SCADA systems

475
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,000
and other credentials are also available

476
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:55,570
but very very rare so these are very low

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,570
numbers so most data is personally

478
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,939
identifiable information and if you

479
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,669
think about that it's quite obvious

480
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,880
stuff and that the government has the

481
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,340
largest footprint because they just have

482
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,350
so many employees if you have a look to

483
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:16,780
the number the the number of the US

484
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,230
forces including the reserve over there

485
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,410
in some nearly 2.5 million people and

486
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,870
the average fortune 500 company has

487
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,929
about 50,000 people the biggest one

488
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,510
about four hundred thousand something so

489
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,580
the governmental area it's much bigger

490
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,220
with respect to the people who are

491
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,889
working there so it's just normal that

492
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,990
the footprint will be bigger because the

493
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,570
personal personally identifiable

494
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,900
information is from random hacks from

495
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,928
Facebook to something and on a

496
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,720
statistical base it's very logical that

497
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,970
we have bigger food drinks for the

498
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,320
governmental services over there because

499
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:03,220
of the number of the employees of course

500
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:06,610
also whistleblowers are using the Tor

501
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,340
network if they want to expose higher

502
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:13,000
classified material but normally you are

503
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:17,010
using only services like secure drop or

504
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,770
global leaks which prevent your good

505
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:23,049
anonymity but they are not going to sell

506
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:27,059
that stuff over the dark web so

507
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:30,850
only using it to have anonymous

508
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:35,730
connection to the media but not working

509
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:39,070
or selling that on the dark web so most

510
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:42,460
important is that the data may not be

511
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,908
useful to directly endanger a selected

512
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,249
mission because the network is very

513
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:50,739
heavily surveyed a lot of undercover

514
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:53,350
agents are doing their job there and you

515
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,899
also have a lot of scams so you can't be

516
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,859
really sure that the information that

517
00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:01,779
you are buying there is correct there's

518
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:03,309
a lot of honey tokens and honey data in

519
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,289
there that's a very good thing from a

520
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:11,200
security aspect and it's not so DIF

521
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:13,509
to build up a reputation systems in the

522
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,499
area of drug trafficking that's quite

523
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:20,769
easy think about eBay so these darknet

524
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:22,899
this type web platforms have reputation

525
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,169
systems nowadays too so if you are

526
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:28,869
trading drugs on a daily base you have a

527
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:31,989
lot of words if you are doing a good or

528
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:35,619
a bad job so you can have a good feeling

529
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:38,080
if a vendor or also a buyer is a good or

530
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,539
a bad one and if you will get on what

531
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,340
you are paying for but on the other hand

532
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,549
that's much more difficult if you are

533
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,918
thinking about selling or buying very

534
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,158
high-value data bits because that will

535
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,070
be typically only one time or was a very

536
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,100
low frequency so you don't have the

537
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,840
chance to build up that trust in the

538
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,908
seller as it's possible with a

539
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,379
reputation system for example for the

540
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:08,190
drug trafficking much more difficult are

541
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:11,289
the indirect and detriments with

542
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,389
personal identifiable information think

543
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:16,600
for example about social engineering

544
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:20,709
attacks that can be of course very

545
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,719
useful if you for example identify some

546
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,909
information from the leader of a mission

547
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,580
or something like that you can work on

548
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,799
that as an attacker and it can generate

549
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,220
reputation damage for the forces of

550
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:36,429
course and especially with looking at

551
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,760
hybrid warfare techniques that can be

552
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,940
very

553
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:46,110
useful but mainly for indirect and net

554
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:49,570
not targeted attacked or submission so

555
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:52,949
very important darkweb is very often

556
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:57,610
heavily overrated most from its eyes and

557
00:26:52,950 --> 00:27:00,220
also the analysis sometimes are not too

558
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:04,419
good as they are working of with data

559
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,750
with very high uncertainty do but an

560
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:12,490
other aspect the way these services are

561
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:16,720
working has changed not too long ago so

562
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:19,420
the new the version 3 of these services

563
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,610
hidden in the dark web is much more

564
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,420
secure and provides have much better

565
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,149
anonymity

566
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,740
than the older ones and the tracking

567
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,940
opportunities and the attack

568
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:34,480
opportunities really reduced that may

569
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,390
increase the use of such services for

570
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,840
also dealing information again but we

571
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,120
have to ask also of course if you set up

572
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,189
a completely secret platform in no way

573
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,409
on the dark web and you want to sell it

574
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,410
if nobody can find the diet and data who

575
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:52,000
should buy it so it's nice from that

576
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,370
point of view that you have a perfect

577
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,490
communication may be out there but if

578
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:00,310
you want to deal with the data you have

579
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:04,330
to break out of that little anonymous

580
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:06,610
place so my recommendations with regard

581
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,399
to the dark weapons and information

582
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:12,070
there is a continuously dragging of all

583
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,370
parts or the clear net of course the

584
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,340
Deep Web as far as it's possible and of

585
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,010
course the dark web to have early

586
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,560
identifications if some data is lost and

587
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,600
gets leaked to these areas therefore the

588
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,490
creation of fingerprints of sensitive

589
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,159
files and the monitoring of it and there

590
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,610
are services available which can help to

591
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,030
implement that very powerful as the

592
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,120
implementation of honey tones and

593
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,389
strategically placed decoys so providing

594
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,639
very real real looking data with some

595
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,520
beacon that is calling home if it's

596
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,890
opened or accessed by somebody so you

597
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,540
get a very early

598
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,840
education that something is happening

599
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,490
and you can have a closer look where are

600
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,879
things going on and where it's coming

601
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,950
from

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,930
and of course the preparation and

603
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,990
testing of action plans and guidelines

604
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,840
how do I have to handle the tech tech

605
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,440
leaks which brush in procedures should I

606
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:13,230
use to initiate the deletion of the data

607
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,350
finally you can also think about the use

608
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:19,260
of torah for offensive attacks just

609
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:22,230
doing the anonymization route and then

610
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,300
for it for example doing hacking attacks

611
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,360
and stuff like that so it can be very

612
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:31,320
interesting for the military to just

613
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,379
monitor also exit notes for signs of

614
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,960
these attacks as I said the numbers low

615
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,620
that's not too difficult that may also

616
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,320
be an opportunity of course in the legal

617
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,090
framework it must be possible there's

618
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,450
much more information in the paper I

619
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:50,520
invite everybody to read it and if you

620
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,740
have questions you can also come back to

621
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,500
me on the topic later thank you very

622
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:00,590
much

623
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:03,929
[Applause]

624
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:06,870
we can definitely open the question time

625
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:15,600
with Robert any questions from the

626
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:18,120
audience please okay so I will give you

627
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,550
some more minutes to think about some

628
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,820
questions for Robert I already have one

629
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:27,240
I mean in the first of all I read of

630
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,740
course the whole paper first so and in

631
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,990
the conclusions you see it during your

632
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:36,150
presentation you talked about the that a

633
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,230
comprehensive data management strategy

634
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:44,309
and particularly a preparation actions

635
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:47,670
plan and the testing of these procedures

636
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:49,530
studies procedures and you know could

637
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,200
you explain a bit more in detail those

638
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,970
kind of preparation what do you mean

639
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:59,040
more concretely that means be prepared

640
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,380
what to do if such a leak is now

641
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,320
identified so we have different means

642
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,070
you have different platforms which are

643
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,990
regularly used where the data is going

644
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:15,419
when someone is offering it so for

645
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,600
example all these pastebin sites and you

646
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:22,110
can implement quite easy monitoring

647
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,870
mechanisms for these locations just to

648
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,169
have an idea what's going on there so

649
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:30,750
you can reduce the uncertainty to what's

650
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,700
going on and try to identify as early as

651
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,850
possible out there something new and

652
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:40,800
then you should have a very good idea

653
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:43,919
yeah how to delete the stuff as far as

654
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,690
possible so for some providers think

655
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,640
about the Germany leaks about our

656
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,190
politicians to the beginning of the

657
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:55,080
years a lot of servers also were in

658
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:59,460
Germany itself that has the data also in

659
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:01,379
much much different countries it's more

660
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,470
difficult to delete but at least you

661
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,809
should be able to delete as many of the

662
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,690
data as possible so trying to think

663
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,610
about where may it be published who is a

664
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,450
provider who's the Internet

665
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:19,439
service provider how can I reduce the

666
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,750
excess so who to call to have the data

667
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,590
deleted to may be blocking access or

668
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,950
things like that

669
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,470
so really a plan where you can think

670
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,510
about okay now the stuff happened it's

671
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,620
over there and that are my contact

672
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,540
points what can I do

673
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,780
of course you will not bring it out of

674
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,940
the internet completely no question but

675
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,030
you can't write or especially in the

676
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,549
beginning try to reduce the spreading of

677
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:48,450
the information by that thank you

678
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:56,070
one more questions yes please on the

679
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:58,049
you're right so from CSR cuk thank you

680
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,428
for your talk was very interesting just

681
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:01,799
a quick short question so if I would

682
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:04,549
summarize your talk I would say hear the

683
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,900
messages if you're looking for really

684
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,460
interesting information on how to spoil

685
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,620
military operations in cyberspace

686
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,390
operations you wouldn't look in the dark

687
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,229
web so as a technical person I know you

688
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:19,530
are well would you be looking I would

689
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:23,220
use just the traditional into channels

690
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:26,610
for that because they are they they're

691
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,610
it established for decades and that's a

692
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:33,899
way how to do with that information it

693
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:36,870
can be that something is also lead over

694
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,850
the dark web of course but I think the

695
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:42,270
chances we will find such information on

696
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:45,689
the clear net is is much higher maybe

697
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:48,090
someone is not thinking about the risks

698
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,120
when using tor that it may happen that

699
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,639
it's appearing there but if one is

700
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,830
really thinking about the risk of

701
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,870
surveillance the possibilities of the

702
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,120
anonymous ation he whatnot

703
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,070
would not use that saying but yeah

704
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,790
traditional channel so maybe the clear

705
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:10,649
net but more the traditional direct

706
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:13,379
communication and things like that okay

707
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:15,509
thank you thank you Robert I don't see

708
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:18,210
any other questions and we are running

709
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,100
out of time for this part thank you very

710
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:23,418
much for your clear representation of

711
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,418
your paper will appreciate

712
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,679
and of course you could always approach

713
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:33,768
our speakers in the end of the of the

714
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,509
panel during the break to even ask him

715
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:37,819
more detailed questions if you would

716
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:40,478
like to do so now it's time for our

717
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:43,069
second speaker dr. Andrea melegari

718
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:45,828
andrea is a senior executive vice

719
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:47,239
president at expert system in Stella

720
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:49,789
beauty is focused on intelligence

721
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,609
security solutions for businesses and

722
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:54,979
led governmental agencies and under I

723
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:58,450
got you just perience in coordinating

724
00:34:54,978 --> 00:35:00,470
projects that use cognitive computing

725
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,930
technologies to support strategic

726
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,950
analysis of data today with this

727
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:08,239
presentation

728
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:10,390
Andrea predation uncover dark web

729
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:14,329
identities using artificial intelligence

730
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:17,269
telemetry with a live demo will propose

731
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:21,769
the use of artificial energy to increase

732
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:24,098
the performance of geometry applied to

733
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:27,379
the dark web in order to detect or

734
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:29,930
reveal possible threat actors acting in

735
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,109
the net so Andrea please audience is

736
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:35,538
waiting for you thank you everybody so

737
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:38,569
my intention as you can read in my title

738
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:42,349
is to spend much of my time in

739
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:45,920
demonstrating you some live demo before

740
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:50,079
doing that some basic concepts about the

741
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,390
topic of my discussion as telemetry is

742
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,969
the application of the study of the

743
00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:02,450
linguistic style okay so our goal is to

744
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:07,489
use the style of a brightner in order to

745
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:11,089
identify it it it's not it's not a new

746
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:17,979
technique probably most of you know very

747
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:21,739
well Unabomber and salami tree played a

748
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:28,098
significant significant role in solving

749
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:32,119
this investigation specifically it has

750
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:35,079
been used to pinpoint the age and the

751
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:40,180
geographic origin of the main

752
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:44,170
suck spit so the famous Ted Kaczynski in

753
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,129
this specific application we have three

754
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:50,259
goals

755
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:53,979
the first one is try to attribute the

756
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:57,009
text to one of the three dark web

757
00:36:53,979 --> 00:37:02,709
accounts you can read in the top of the

758
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:08,219
slide the second goal is to profile the

759
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:13,390
prediction of the age and of the sex so

760
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:16,359
how the system works we have obviously a

761
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:22,239
training data and in this specific

762
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:25,660
contest we have considered 180 texts 60

763
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:29,190
texts for each one of the three guys you

764
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:33,729
saw in the previous slide the second

765
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:36,190
step is to create a model combining two

766
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:36,759
different artificial intelligence

767
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,390
technology

768
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:42,670
the first one is cognitive technology my

769
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,160
company has developed this technology in

770
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,709
the last 20 years and the second

771
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,969
component of the artificial intelligence

772
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:55,118
technique we use is weaker is the famous

773
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:58,359
open-source tool so then we define a

774
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,199
prediction obviously with a confidence

775
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:05,098
level and then we test and update what

776
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:08,859
we have built in the three main steps

777
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:12,549
obviously after the test the update is

778
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:17,589
mandatory in order to increase precision

779
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:21,390
recall the text we have to consider so

780
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:24,519
the training data are very strained text

781
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:29,519
coming from the DAR web where you can

782
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:35,618
find short text less than 200 characters

783
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:39,430
medium text between 200 and 500 and what

784
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:43,079
we have defined long text more than 500

785
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:47,180
characters so let's try to understand

786
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:52,609
with the live demo as we can create

787
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:55,759
eight the semantic parameters the

788
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:59,240
linguistic style information that we

789
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,869
will send to weaker in order to create

790
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:07,009
the prediction for doing that I I love

791
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:09,619
to show you something live so it is not

792
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:14,359
a text coming from the dark web but it

793
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:19,609
is anyway a good example of what we can

794
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:21,170
do let's try to see if the internet

795
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:26,450
connection works because in this

796
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:30,260
situation I see some problem it's a

797
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,328
lifetime effect obviously anyway let's

798
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,950
try to use another text in order to show

799
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:39,579
you what what I consider useful for this

800
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:48,399
demonstration so here we have a text and

801
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:51,319
when we process a text Kaja Tom extracts

802
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,829
semantic parameters a lot of semantic

803
00:39:51,319 --> 00:40:00,160
parameters as you can see here we are

804
00:39:54,829 --> 00:40:06,349
considering concepts instead of keywords

805
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:09,940
so people because in the text we found

806
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:12,500
on ultra my pants and some organization

807
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,980
because in the text we found the

808
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:21,410
Republican Party and so on intention

809
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:28,069
verb decide form of thought reasoning

810
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:35,000
and so on so what we did is exactly a

811
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:38,599
very similar approach of our brain does

812
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,809
so you remember during the primary

813
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:45,099
school we learn about morphological

814
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:48,380
analysis grammatical analysis and

815
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:51,589
something different here is what you can

816
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:58,309
see so in the right part of the screen

817
00:40:51,589 --> 00:41:03,288
you see for example that walls is

818
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:08,289
a firm of a form of the verb to be okay

819
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:11,809
and every element you can find here has

820
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:15,439
been disambiguated so we are working

821
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:17,180
using concept and when we talk about

822
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:20,029
Secretary of State

823
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:23,328
we know that artificial intelligence

824
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:25,989
know that we are talking about foreign

825
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:30,109
minister a minister a politician a

826
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:34,509
professional people so what what we can

827
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:38,029
do here is to extract a lot of

828
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:42,979
linguistic parameters that you can use

829
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:45,319
for understanding the text the content

830
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:48,979
of the text for example here we have

831
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:50,749
extracted some relations okay and with

832
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:54,049
the relation you can find also the

833
00:41:50,749 --> 00:42:00,259
different connection semantic connection

834
00:41:54,049 --> 00:42:04,939
with other entities so Kaja tone is able

835
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:07,339
to extract some entities following a

836
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:13,519
very clear process which is a linguistic

837
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:16,219
analysis coming back to the articles

838
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,019
talking about what is going on in israel

839
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:22,029
i would like to show you what we can

840
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:26,089
extract because the level of the

841
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:31,269
parameters that you can get is is much

842
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:37,009
better and for example could include

843
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:40,428
what we have named categorization why

844
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:42,529
here we are talking about voting why

845
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:46,969
here we are talking about parties

846
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:57,549
movement what are the people mentioned

847
00:42:46,969 --> 00:43:00,619
here can you see that here you have he

848
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:04,279
not only Benjamin Netanyahu but also he

849
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:07,910
and thanks to this capability you can

850
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:11,119
also create interesting connection where

851
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,049
Benjamin Netanyahu is linked with other

852
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,369
and

853
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:20,239
this or is linked with other facts okay

854
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:25,329
so with the semantic analysis you can

855
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:32,179
get very interesting semantic parameters

856
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:38,319
entities relation emotions why we have a

857
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:40,849
sucess and liquid party at the same time

858
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,049
mister natalia netanyahu enter

859
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:45,640
negotiation to form a coalition

860
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:50,529
government after is liquid party one

861
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:55,549
sucess so we extract 80 different

862
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:59,619
parameters correlated to emotion okay so

863
00:43:55,549 --> 00:44:02,900
cogito is able to do a lot of things

864
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:05,739
that are correlated to the capability to

865
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,439
understand the text but you can also

866
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:12,729
extract technical parameters that are

867
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:17,479
correlated to the specific linguistic

868
00:44:12,729 --> 00:44:21,649
style for example you can say that this

869
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:22,999
tax talk about these verb classes for

870
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,089
example a lot of linguistic

871
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:29,169
communication a lot of words correlated

872
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:35,119
to movement we are talking about

873
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:38,449
grammatical tenses simple present is the

874
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:44,859
number one and just a little bit future

875
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:48,559
or we can extract the register and slang

876
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:51,489
we can define a readability index and so

877
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:57,140
on so at the end of this process you

878
00:44:51,489 --> 00:45:00,890
have a result which is a very rich set

879
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:05,118
of linguistic parameters for the

880
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:08,589
specific goal we have considered 200

881
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,299
linguistic parameters probably too much

882
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:17,719
so with the linguistic parameter you

883
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:23,359
ever now you can train the model using

884
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:25,760
we can here we have a text finally we

885
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,700
have a text that is not part

886
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,030
the training set obviously we used to

887
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:37,129
create the model it is a new text and it

888
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:42,200
is a text written by Marvin 42 let's try

889
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:47,510
to understand how we can process the

890
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:53,210
text using the combination of the two

891
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:56,210
different tools we have combined so here

892
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:01,970
we have the text here we have the model

893
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:07,790
and what is going on now is the analysis

894
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:10,700
where cogito extracts the semantic

895
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:14,810
parameters that this text contains and

896
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:19,100
then we cur the machine learning

897
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:21,799
algorithms try to combine the results of

898
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,830
the parameter we have extracted I don't

899
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,780
want to bore you about the parameters

900
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:31,670
but here is the list of the parameters

901
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:35,930
we are considering now and for example

902
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:40,340
in the first column you can find the

903
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:44,980
specific result and when you see the

904
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:48,560
green stars it means that this parameter

905
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:53,410
matches a specific model in this case

906
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:56,120
the model of the people that weaker is

907
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:59,810
associated to the order of the text so

908
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:04,630
here we are saying that probably this is

909
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:08,090
the confidence level probably Marvin 42

910
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:10,550
wrote this text and the confidence level

911
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,650
is pretty good this this is not the

912
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,680
precision this is the confidence level

913
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,620
coming from weaker we are not so

914
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:24,080
confident about the age we think that is

915
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:26,390
probably in the forties but you see 38

916
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:31,610
percent of confidence level is not much

917
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:34,970
and we think he is a male okay so let's

918
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:38,480
try to the cap we we have a training set

919
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:42,319
of data 60 documents

920
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,050
from Marvin this grant and orange the

921
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,320
three dark web accounts we have

922
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:51,320
extracted the semantic parameters with

923
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:56,420
cogito with Wicca we have created a

924
00:47:51,320 --> 00:48:01,010
model and this is the result coming back

925
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:09,920
to the slide some comments about what we

926
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:14,270
have we have built so first of all the

927
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,530
precision and the recall when I talk

928
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:19,960
about precision

929
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:24,680
I consider the more relevant results

930
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:29,720
that the system is a return us when I

931
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:32,029
consider a call I hope to get most of

932
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,649
the rev relevant result I don't want

933
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:43,130
miss a lot of useful information and

934
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:48,200
using just 180 texts just few texts the

935
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:49,690
level of precision is 78% and also the

936
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:58,730
recall is not bad

937
00:48:49,690 --> 00:49:02,420
so a good starting point I would say but

938
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:06,829
a suggestion for you comes from the

939
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:11,230
combination of still Amma tree and this

940
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:18,619
type of goal so the the anonymizing

941
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:22,970
programmers task it is a paper published

942
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:24,680
on 2015 you can easily find all the

943
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,470
information about this paper

944
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:30,368
I'm not correlated to this paper but I

945
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:38,720
would like to highlight some conclusion

946
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:43,250
about this paper so they wrote that the

947
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:50,060
goal was to understand the source code

948
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:52,180
outers of qi plus plus source code take

949
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:59,390
a look at the result

950
00:49:52,180 --> 00:50:02,899
considering 1,600 people 94% of

951
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:06,770
precision not bad so you can apply

952
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:10,220
Salama tree not only on a text written

953
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:13,220
by dark web accounts but it seems that

954
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:24,680
also the programmers have their

955
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:30,890
linguistic style second slide the it is

956
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:35,419
easier to identify difficult programming

957
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:38,270
tasks and at the same time the skillet

958
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:41,060
programmer is something that you can

959
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:45,490
identify with more precision so a

960
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:50,680
provocation for you they write that

961
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:57,859
still OMA tree could be applied to

962
00:50:50,680 --> 00:51:02,509
malicious code could this technique help

963
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:04,550
you just a little bit to solve the

964
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:10,280
famous problem of the attribution of

965
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:20,020
malware in it this is a suggestion for

966
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:23,170
you I at this last slide so conclusion

967
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:27,070
still AMA tree can be useful for you

968
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:30,770
dark foreign covered our web accounts

969
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:35,980
probably reading the paper I show you

970
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:44,480
before also for profiling malicious code

971
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:48,590
authors second extracting manually 200

972
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,760
semantic parameters is not exactly an

973
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:56,990
easy task so the human analysis that is

974
00:51:52,760 --> 00:52:03,650
now the common tool it is low and is

975
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:07,120
expensive and my conclusion is that

976
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:10,060
combining probably in a better way

977
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,470
artificial intelligence technology for

978
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:16,820
automatic extracting the semantic

979
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:23,419
parameter and for using machine learning

980
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:26,360
in order to predict the authorship using

981
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:35,210
the semantic parameter could be faster

982
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:37,700
and cheaper don't forget my last note we

983
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:41,780
are not talking about replacing human

984
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:48,230
analysis artificial intelligence works

985
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:53,000
pretty good but now my position is that

986
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:58,360
we can consider in this context to

987
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,360
augment the human capabilities thank you

988
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:11,950
so we have any questions for Andrea I

989
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:15,038
hope that the consideration regarding

990
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:20,520
the the way how to buying using those

991
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:20,520
kind of capability to bind the possible

992
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:29,470
malware programmers could be really

993
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:35,020
interesting for even further discussion

994
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:42,848
here in our five minutes questions yes

995
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:46,900
we're one okay sorry please thank you I

996
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:53,619
do have a question do you hear me yeah

997
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:58,119
yeah yeah sorry but yeah you are in the

998
00:53:53,619 --> 00:54:00,039
dark side of the room sorry the Tor

999
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,049
network yeah okay

1000
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:03,730
my questions are following you know it

1001
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:06,700
seems to me and correct me if I'm wrong

1002
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:09,130
you have a kind of two major problems

1003
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,558
issues that you solved first is a

1004
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:14,020
contextual analysis and semantic

1005
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:17,200
analysis and use some semantics or

1006
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:20,349
conceptual graphs to identify the

1007
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:24,058
meaning of the text and second part use

1008
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:28,809
some statistical linguistic you know

1009
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:32,770
keywords to identify that tribution

1010
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:35,380
you know who you know who is a person so

1011
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:39,880
what questions following is overall it's

1012
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:42,849
a linear process you first do semantic

1013
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,760
analysis of the text and after that you

1014
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:49,089
do you do that tribution or this is a

1015
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,849
kind of multi-step what iterative

1016
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:55,660
process the first two semantics then do

1017
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:58,000
a little bit statistical analysis get

1018
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,930
better at what understanding and start

1019
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,609
semantic analysis in what in the loop a

1020
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:07,569
very good question thank you so our

1021
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:10,089
experience is in performing cognitive

1022
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:12,700
computing semantic analysis tools okay

1023
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:16,480
we have a limited experience in machine

1024
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:18,210
learning methods but obviously we use

1025
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:24,630
them

1026
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:30,100
my my idea is that putting the text

1027
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:32,200
directly inside weeka cannot grant you

1028
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:39,190
the same level of precision

1029
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:43,299
okay so text analysis is cannot be based

1030
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:48,100
on keyword analysis must be a semantic

1031
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:50,830
analysis and the combination of two

1032
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:54,190
different artificial intelligence tool

1033
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:57,279
the first one that can produce the

1034
00:55:54,190 --> 00:56:02,619
semantic parameters that are important

1035
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:06,490
for you for this type of goal hood

1036
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:09,640
something that can create the best

1037
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:14,109
condition for the second step for the

1038
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:17,529
machine learning prediction okay so our

1039
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:21,369
spirit is that the different nuances you

1040
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:23,530
can find out in a text is not something

1041
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:25,960
that you can manage with the statistic

1042
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:30,580
heuristic approach okay you have to

1043
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:36,220
prepare the data and again we are still

1044
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:39,640
considering which semantic parameter we

1045
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:42,100
have to use because now we have gathered

1046
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:46,029
all the semantic parameters and we have

1047
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:49,240
ingested inside weaker probably we have

1048
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:51,790
to select them in a different way and

1049
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,100
probably we have to wait with different

1050
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:58,330
values the semantic parameter I show

1051
00:56:54,100 --> 00:57:03,160
before but no way from considering our

1052
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:06,040
experience my opinion is that it's a

1053
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,960
really really challenging task and you

1054
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:12,640
must to face it combining different

1055
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:17,260
technologies we honestly speaking we

1056
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:22,020
should try to increase the training data

1057
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:25,900
set with more than 60 tags for each

1058
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:28,480
darkweb accounts and then we can

1059
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,760
understand more but the first result is

1060
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,970
something that I consider very poor

1061
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:38,680
- - to understand more about this type

1062
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:41,730
of application I guess that we have

1063
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,560
another question from the audience yes

1064
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:46,120
thank you for your presentation I had

1065
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,830
racked up two questions

1066
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:54,580
why is how did you get samples or data

1067
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:57,250
set so you needed some arathor data set

1068
00:57:54,580 --> 00:58:01,110
for machine running so that's why

1069
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:04,900
actually it's very difficult to correct

1070
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:10,660
correct answer correct the data set so

1071
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:15,060
we do yeah in this specific situation we

1072
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:20,259
we have used a dark web but gather

1073
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:23,920
search engine that acquired the

1074
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:27,580
different texts issued by the three

1075
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:33,310
different people we have a focused on

1076
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:35,650
okay so it could be also manually copy

1077
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:38,259
and past if you want but in this case we

1078
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:41,080
have setup a crawler for acquiring

1079
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,980
documents it is not so easy to find out

1080
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:48,160
many texts in the dark web because as

1081
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:50,890
you have completely understood the

1082
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,560
volume the length of the test is

1083
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:56,650
important okay so this type of

1084
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:59,710
techniques still AMA tree works better

1085
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:01,870
if you have a long text if you have just

1086
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:06,040
few words is not is not so simple to

1087
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:11,940
identify your style of writing I know a

1088
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:17,050
better Iraq task so how did you get

1089
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:19,300
samples or data set so we crawl we throw

1090
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:25,630
the sample from the dark web and but

1091
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:28,870
it's a not so how do you say you

1092
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:33,460
imagined or estimated something but you

1093
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:35,920
need some correct ones yeah yeah yeah we

1094
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:38,920
consider a blog a blog rather than the

1095
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,580
dark web where the free accounts posted

1096
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:48,800
the text okay and so

1097
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:52,340
the main or agenda is this Oh God so I

1098
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:57,020
got sorry for for understanding if he is

1099
00:59:52,340 --> 01:00:00,590
a man or or if he's 30 40s 50s and so on

1100
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:02,930
we have another sample sample text okay

1101
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:09,020
we have three different training data

1102
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:13,640
one for understanding sex and here we

1103
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:16,880
have more text that we know that are are

1104
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:19,940
produced by twenty years old guys or

1105
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:24,020
fifty years ago or guys or female and me

1106
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:26,510
and about the free accounts that web

1107
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:29,060
accounts we have the crawled their

1108
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:37,550
content and we have used other content

1109
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:42,650
to measure the number sixty sixty text

1110
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:46,640
for each account so globally 180 text

1111
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:48,350
machine learning yeah no no for semantic

1112
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,390
parameters and then formal machine

1113
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:54,140
learning to obviously I've worked ask us

1114
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:57,970
some the whole number with your samples

1115
01:00:54,140 --> 01:01:03,640
so considering the free that web account

1116
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:07,580
180 considering sex and ages thousand

1117
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:10,279
okay I can suggest if you would like to

1118
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,890
get some more detail information to talk

1119
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,170
with the Andrea may be more in deep even

1120
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,330
during our break so we still have time

1121
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:21,800
one minute for one more question if we

1122
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:26,920
had yes he is someone be in the end of

1123
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:30,170
the the rear of the room just really

1124
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:35,180
quick so my question is is this

1125
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:37,670
technique also usable to identify let's

1126
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:41,810
say fake news or information warfare and

1127
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:44,900
how it would also respond to the machine

1128
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:46,910
learning doctored text would it be

1129
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,980
possible to identify those as well thank

1130
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,060
you that's very good question very good

1131
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,040
question

1132
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:55,549
we have implement we have already

1133
01:01:52,040 --> 01:02:01,070
implemented this technique for

1134
01:01:55,550 --> 01:02:04,040
detecting fake news when they they are

1135
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:08,210
generating by automatically by tools

1136
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:11,270
okay this is the perfect situation where

1137
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:13,550
you have something tools that can

1138
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:17,650
generate fake news in order to design

1139
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:21,650
firm 8 and obviously the the tools that

1140
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:25,220
an algorithm can can produce our really

1141
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:28,490
really well characterized by something

1142
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:31,310
that is not the human style of writing

1143
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:33,770
text so this is a typical application of

1144
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:35,810
Earth's telemetry together with

1145
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:37,400
artificial intelligence also inside

1146
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:40,700
social media intelligence you can do the

1147
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,040
same for example you have many Twitter

1148
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:47,210
accounts where you have simply a

1149
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:51,410
nickname Mickey Mouse 42 and you want to

1150
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:54,700
understand if you can find out the model

1151
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:57,290
you built using Mickey Mouse that tweet

1152
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,029
is something that you can use in an open

1153
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:02,029
source so you can understand that Mickey

1154
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:05,359
Mouse 42 in the open source intelligence

1155
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:09,140
is under melegari for example and then

1156
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:11,980
you can combine Mickey Mouse 42 with a

1157
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:15,080
specific person so Thank You Andrea

1158
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:18,850
really appreciate your dynamic here damn

1159
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,850
lib like demo
