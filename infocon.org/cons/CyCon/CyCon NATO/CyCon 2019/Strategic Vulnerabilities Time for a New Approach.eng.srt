1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
welcome everyone before our casual and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,029
fancy saikhan dinners to the session of

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,460
strategic vulnerabilities time for a new

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,379
approach lieutenant Lee sound Olga from

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,719
CCD co e and it's such an honor and

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,130
privilege to be facilitating this this

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
panel in saikhan surrounded with

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,529
billions people colleagues who are also

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,330
expert in their areas and they the

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,310
saying goes a chain is only as strong as

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,909
its weakest link in this sense more

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,580
lately

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,660
we have been hearing more and more about

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,820
cyber data information system

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,159
vulnerabilities and then this appears to

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,739
be a case with two sides on one side

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,660
it's not difficult to see that this can

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,328
be a low-hanging fruit in regard to

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,459
enhancing cyber effects which I believe

20
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,920
also a topic being discussed more openly

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,230
more lately and on the other side the

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,870
situation leads us to to multiple areas

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,519
of concerns among these areas there are

24
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,160
two areas in my humble opinion which

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,739
have been overlooked so far one is that

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,449
the cyber information sharing for

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,459
vulnerabilities in industrial control

28
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,649
systems and critical infrastructure is

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,140
somewhat lagging behind the others and

30
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,090
the other area is that the recent

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,400
projection of everlasting battle between

32
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,900
cost and equality and some call it a

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,840
triangle with cost quality and speed

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,770
which one cannot have all at all at the

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,860
same time and and using the commercial

36
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,890
to shelf software or oftentimes works

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,720
wonders even on military systems and in

38
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,150
the US with a critical infrastructure

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,060
and widely opted for but this also

40
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,689
brings significant liabilities for the

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,130
corresponding systems cyber security and

42
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,320
still staying on the defensive side and

43
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,240
moving forward from being reactive

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,820
towards proactive against cyber

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,009
incidents concerning indications and

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,008
warnings the idea is put forward that

47
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,780
NATO nations can benefit a lot from

48
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,479
adopting a high level educated approach

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,100
which is also a future tier soon

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,060
luckily we have four great papers and

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,509
speakers here today

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,829
addressing these challenging topics I

53
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,869
guess it makes the most sense to start

54
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,729
with a higher level approach followed by

55
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,210
cyber effects and sequentially a bit

56
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,489
more in depth analysis about coach

57
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,810
vulnerabilities and information sharing

58
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,459
and I like to note that each

59
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,959
presentation today will be followed by a

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,340
brief Q&A for particular Q&A

61
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,890
and at the very end we will have a

62
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,799
longer overall Q&A session so if you

63
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,480
have overarching questions regarding

64
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,689
multiple topics please keep them ready

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,518
for the very end so without further ado

66
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:29,828
I'd like to pass the stage to miss

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,510
Pollyanna Lilly Miss Judy is a party

68
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:33,459

terror actors information warfare

72
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,680
election security and machine learning

strategy and NATO's policy towards

76
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:52,750
emerging powers so Billy onna stage is

77
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,849
yours hello everyone thank you for

78
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,169
attending our panel today I would also

79
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,488
like to thank the saikhan program

80
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,400
committee for inviting me to speak here

81
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,750
it's a pleasure to be with you I'm

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,060
presenting a paper that you can also

83
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,980
find in the conference proceedings

84
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,319
because I know we all want to get to the

85
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,328
beach party and for time considerations

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,679
I'm going to keep my remarks short and

87
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,139
just outline the main arguments of our

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,099
paper so feel free to read it if you

89
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,310
would like to obtain further information

90
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,599
about that points out address here

91
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,479
before I start I would also like to

92
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,429
acknowledge the invaluable work of my

93
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,459
co-authors these are Quentin Hodgson

94
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,479
William a blonde and Adam Moore

95
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,639
unfortunately Lewin Quentin couldn't

96
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,709
join us here today but Adam is here and

97
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,659
he's on the front row so please feel

98
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,189
free to reach out to either Adam or

99
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,228
myself after this panel if you still

100
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,519
have any questions about our work or if

101
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,959
you have any feedback for us we would

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,509
like to hear from you and talk to you

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,370
afterwards the paper that I'll be

104
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:47,108
presenting is also part of a larger

105
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,750
report the paper that we're working on

106
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,310
at the RAND Corporation and we plan to

107
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,949
publish a more detailed report on the

108
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,509
same topic in the next few months so if

109
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,579
you would like to see how our research

110
00:03:55,509 --> 00:04:01,689
will evolve either get in touch with us

111
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,849
or check out our website so today I will

112
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,858
be talking to you about an indications

113
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,048
and warning framework also known as an

114
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,229
ion W framework that we designed in

115
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,389
order to predict to predict the early

116
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:16,269
detection to detect early cyber

117
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,489
incidents so we embarked upon this

118
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,560
research because we identified a general

119
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,630
discontent among government agencies in

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,370
the private sector over our current

121
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,030
nature responses to cyber incidents

122
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,340
today our responses are rather reactive

123
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,719
if we look at Lockheed Martin cyber kill

124
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,080
chain which I have outlined on this

125
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,789
slide we usually are able to focus on

126
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,560
detecting cyber incidents at the

127
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:41,620
delivery stage of a weaponized payload

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,330
but not really beforehand the delivery

129
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,629
stage and afterwards is usually what our

130
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,729
approaches today are and just to

131
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,409
demonstrate that with a few recent

132
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,370
examples of cyber incidents that we

133
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:56,080
probably all familiar with the 2014

134
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,389
cyberattack on Sony Pictures the 2015

135
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,460
and 2016 cyber intrusions in the

136
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,830
Democratic National Committee as well as

137
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,870
even the 2007 Jiro's attacks on Estonia

138
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,180
were all examples of attacks which were

139
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,259
detected either at the delivery stage or

140
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,020
past at deliver stage so we propose to

141
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,720
address this issue by introducing an ion

142
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,180
W framework for cyberspace with which we

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,190
hope defenders will be able to make

144
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,870
their approaches to cyber incidents a

145
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,969
little more proactive and will be able

146
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,620
to detect cyber incidents at the earlier

147
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:28,659
stages of lockheed-martin cyber kill

148
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,310
chain which in our case will be reckon

149
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,310
essence in weaponization the first two

150
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,319
stages before delivering our cyber NW

151
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,780
framework is informed by analysis of

152
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,550
existing mature and W frameworks that

153
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,919
the US intelligence community has been

154
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,360
using we specifically chose frameworks

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,008
that the US intelligence community has

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,870
been using because that community has

157
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,610
been developing them for over several

158
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,259
decades ever since the Second World War

159
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,539
there is an a publicly available

160
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,919
literature on them and also enough

161
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,169
information on the methodological

162
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,270
pitfalls that one should consider when

163
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,400
applying those frameworks for all those

164
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,250
reasons those frameworks seem very

165
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,330
appropriate to base of cyber m and W

166
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,310
framework um so with that in mind we

167
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,159
asked ourselves the first question what

168
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,259
is I on w how does US intelligence

169
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,120
community intelligence community

170
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,130
understand it and define it and apply it

171
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,229
and how does the cyber community

172
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,120
understand it and we as we were

173
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,500
conducting our research we realized that

174
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,389
there there is a significant

175
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,800
terminological divided between the cyber

176
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,130
community in the US intelligence

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,840
community on what ion W is the US

178
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,310
intelligence community has a fairly

179
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,310
well-established understanding of this

180
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,289
concept to them it's a process to detect

181
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,570
and report information that for warns of

182
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,960
hostile activities in other words it's a

183
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,759
struck

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,280
short way of addressing friends in

185
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,560
monitoring threats and the US

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,448
intelligence community has been using on

187
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,539
W frameworks to monitor the activities

188
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,150
of state and non-state actors usually in

189
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:58,180
on cyber domains which are airspace sea

190
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,068
and land but not in cyberspace however

191
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,770
as we all know the DDoS attacks on

192
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,330
Estonia in 2007 which are one of the

193
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,310
main reasons why we're here today

194
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,870
placed cyber operations and cyber

195
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,430
capabilities among the tools of

196
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,500
statecraft and necessitated an

197
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,889
adaptation of those traditional and W

198
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,889
frameworks to the cyber domain that's

199
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,840
why however despite the fact that cyber

200
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,250
has been growing in importance there's

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,380
still a lack of understanding of what

202
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,150
cyber Island W is to the cyber community

203
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,370
there are various schools of thoughts

204
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,380
and certain cyber experts we have

205
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,210
different opinions on what type of data

206
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,669
should be included in a cyber and W

207
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,560
framework and what the temporal scope of

208
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:38,049
that analysis that should be included in

209
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,449
a cyber and W framework should be so

210
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,190
regarding the type of data some analysts

211
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,810
believe that only technical indicators

212
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,180
should be included in a cyber and W

213
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,030
framework and so far our defenses are

214
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,220
primarily based on technical data others

215
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,229
have started to adopt the idea that

216
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,840
technical in geopolitical indicators

217
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,130
should be included in such a framework

218
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,869
regarding the temporal scope some

219
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,669
analysts believed that only information

220
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,139
up to the delivery stage of

221
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,000
lockheed-martin skill chain should be

222
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,650
included in the analysis while others

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,449
believe that information passage the

224
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,060
state should also be included in this

225
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,060
analysis because of those diverse

226
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,430
opinions we decided to standardize our

227
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,650
understanding of what cyber and W is and

228
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,690
we created our own definition you can

229
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,229
read about it in an article but in brief

230
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,120
we think that cyber inw is an approach

231
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,370
that is used that is focused on

232
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,870
collecting and analyzing information for

233
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,409
the purposes of creating indicators that

234
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,789
will facilitate the early detection

235
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:35,649
prediction and early warning of cyber

236
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,078
incidents relative to one's information

237
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,870
environment so every word in this

238
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:42,728
definition matters to us our way the

239
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,220
four researchers that wrote this paper

240
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,870
spend a lot of time debating each word

241
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,970
but here I wanted to highlight two of

242
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,100
the main components of that definition

243
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,800
first regarding data we believe that

244
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,520
both technical and geopolitical

245
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,069
information should be included

246
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,720
Sabourin w framework we believe that the

247
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,580
geopolitical element is especially

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,260
important because it can help us

249
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,120
identify additional triggers that will

250
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,890
help us predict attack in the early

251
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,260
stages of lockheed-martin skill chain

252
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,110
second in terms of timeline we also

253
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,840
believe that information of a cyber

254
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,880
intrusion along the whole line the whole

255
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,260
seven stages of lockheed-martin cyber

256
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,250
kill chain should be included in this

257
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,450
analysis in order to be able to

258
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,630
comprehensively address the adversary

259
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,390
playbook with that definition in mark in

260
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,850
mind we embarked upon crafting the

261
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,860
contours of our own cyber NW framework

262
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,680
and we started by looking at already

263
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,690
existing and W frameworks by the US

264
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,729
intelligence community here I have

265
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,460
listed a few of the frameworks that we

266
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,830
examined and we also described them in

267
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,210
more detail in our paper but a few I

268
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,650
wanted to highlight here are the

269
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,450
Lockwood analytical method for

270
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,189
prediction which is also known as lamp

271
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,740
but don't Google lamp it's not going to

272
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,780
give you the right answer in Google just

273
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,730
read the whole method the second one is

274
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,069
the Judy's defense warning network

275
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,380
handbook we also looked at some more

276
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,210
recently published frameworks that were

277
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,150
informed by an analysis of existing

278
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,580
intelligence and EE frameworks but were

279
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,050
applied to cyberspace and one of them is

280
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,460
the inste framework also known as

281
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,729
intelligent 'national Security Alliance

282
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,640
framework what those frameworks are in

283
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,470
essence are a series of steps that

284
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
describe an analytical process of data

285
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,250
collection analysis and reporting and

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,490
they vary in the number of steps that

287
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,520
they have and they vary in the emphasis

288
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,500
be placed on each step however we also

289
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,960
realize that they contain some

290
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,660
commonalities for example all of the

291
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,280
frameworks recommended that first

292
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,380
defenders identify the threats that

293
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,209
their organization's face and also

294
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,660
identify the assets that they have to

295
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,300
defend

296
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,610
also the frameworks are recommended that

297
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,410
each defender should develop attack

298
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,000
scenarios based on the the malicious

299
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,520
actors that they are likely to face and

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,740
then build indicators based on those

301
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,050
scenarios we also identified certain

302
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,280
deficiencies in those frameworks namely

303
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,719
the fact that there wasn't enough

304
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,939
information on what data should be

305
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,770
included in those frameworks from where

306
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,390
the data should be collected how it

307
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,110
should be analyzed what method should be

308
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,490
used

309
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,650
analysis and how it should be

310
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,510
prioritised another thing that we

311
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,340
thought was lacking was application

312
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,470
there wasn't enough information on how

313
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,520
exactly do you apply those methods in

314
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,560
practice so with that in mind we decided

315
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,569
to create our own practical approach to

316
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,920
cyber and w-where we try to retain the

317
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,860
common elements of those frameworks

318
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,329
while still trying to correct for some

319
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,820
of the deficiencies that we found in

320
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,400
them so our framework consists of four

321
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,770
steps and it's fret based so in step one

322
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,510
we advise the defenders define their

323
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,449
priority in intelligence requirements

324
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,090
also known as P IRS the IRS is a term

325
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,090
used by the military US military

326
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,590
community and it's well defined in in US

327
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,840
military doctrine one of the documents

328
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:58,270
for example you can refer to for further

329
00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:00,130
information is JP - - o - - o P IRS are

330
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,810
components of information that are

331
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,000
deemed critical for timely and effective

332
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,680
decision-making in other words there are

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,570
set of questions that an organization

334
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,099
poses to itself in order to understand

335
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,250
which are the greatest threats that the

336
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,170
organization faces and in our particular

337
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,390
framework we recommend that defenders

338
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,189
start by asking themselves the following

339
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,900
question which are the group's

340
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,640
the particular groups of intrusion sets

341
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,130
that are most likely to pose the

342
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,280
greatest risk to my organization into my

343
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,310
systems based on that question we advise

344
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,689
that defenders ask - sub questions in

345
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,760
order to ensure comprehensiveness of

346
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,860
their answer first of first of the two

347
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,080
questions is which of the identified

348
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,240
intrusions that in question 1 are known

349
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,850
to have targeted us in the past and the

350
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,190
second is which of the identified

351
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,710
intrusion sets in question one human

352
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,020
targeted us in the past but are known to

353
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,150
the intelligence community so based on

354
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,069
those answers we propose that defenders

355
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,050
continue to step two where they focus

356
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,080
their cyber intelligence collection or

357
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,849
CGI collection on collecting technical

358
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,320
technical as well as geopolitical

359
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,150
indicators that correlate with the

360
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,670
malicious activities of the actors that

361
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,459
they identified in step one in step

362
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,439
three we advise the defenders dive

363
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,210
deeper into the technical profiling of

364
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,930
the fed actors they identified in step 1

365
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,700
and use some threat modeling frameworks

366
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,989
similar to miters attack or miters

367
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,350
attack framework to derive further

368
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,940
information about the tool

369
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,370
tactics techniques and procedures that

370
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,860
the actors they identified actually use

371
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:31,220
as a final step we recommend that

372
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,170
defenders conduct continuous or constant

373
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,310
red and purple team exercises to ensure

374
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,900
that their defenses are up to date

375
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,459
against the threats that they're most

376
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:42,380
likely to face so in order to

377
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,430
demonstrate how our approach is applied

378
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,610
in practice we proceeded by applying it

379
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,339
to an actual case study which is a p229

380
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,820
or also known as quasi bears attack in

381
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,770
November of 2018 against US government

382
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,980
agencies think tanks and businesses in

383
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,930
this particular case we use ap 229 s

384
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,790
attack against one organization but for

385
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,800
proprietary purposes and to protect the

386
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,620
identity of that organization we named

387
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,890
it organization C so before the attack

388
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,050
commenced the defenders of organization

389
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,480
Z already implemented our four-step

390
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,310
threat based approach they started by

391
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,750
defining the relevant peers for their

392
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,579
organization and one of the most

393
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,640
important questions that they posed to

394
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,710
themselves is which intrusion sets were

395
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,540
known are known to have targeted us in

396
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,720
the past and one of the answers to those

397
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,430
questions was a p229 based on that

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,410
answer then the defenders of

399
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,079
organizations he proceeded to step to

400
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,579
and collected technical and geopolitical

401
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,250
indicators that correlate with the

402
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,780
behavior of a p229 here among the

403
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,220
technical indicators they identified

404
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,339
tools tactics techniques and procedures

405
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,500
that a p229 uses and specifically their

406
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,510
commodity tools preference among the

407
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,850
geopolitical indicators they identified

408
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,370
a very important one which was that a

409
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,410
p229 was known to have target

410
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,050
organizations e in the past during u.s.

411
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,750
election cycles in his November 2018 was

412
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,579
another US election month the defenders

413
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,080
of organizations he expected the attack

414
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,210
in step three the defenders of

415
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,860
organization Z used my terse attack

416
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,780
framework to derive further information

417
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,630
about the tooth tactics techniques and

418
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,850
procedures of apt 29 and finally they

419
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,230
also conducted a purple team exercise a

420
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,870
few days before the attack and that

421
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,760
purple team exercise was especially

422
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,560
important because the defenders use the

423
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,540
fret emulation software cobalt strike

424
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,520
and on the basis of the results of that

425
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,880
exercise they managed to improve their

426
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,900
verify

427
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,960
and detection system as well as their

428
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,520
resiliency they did so by improving a

429
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,080
few things in their system they ensure

430
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,380
that their IDs or intrusion detection

431
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,910
system can detect both the default and

432
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,830
the moderately modified Cobalts track

433
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:56,540
become become and also they ensure that

434
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,180
they increase their analysis of dns

435
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,800
traffic they also made sure that the

436
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,420
defenders of organizations you will

437
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,990
receive automatic notifications every

438
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,760
time a combination of a file sees that

439
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,010
correlate with the behavior of a p229

440
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,780
was detected by their systems so on the

441
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,640
basis of those improvements then

442
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,640
organizations he was prepared when a

443
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,230
p229 attacked your organization and they

444
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,960
managed to contain the attack in less

445
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,280
than one hour so this case study

446
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,840
demonstrates how a framework can be

447
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,540
applied in practice and help defenders

448
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,920
improve their defenses in conclusion

449
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,329
some of the main highlights now

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,949
approaches that we recommend the

451
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,350
defenders use both technical and

452
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:36,380
geopolitical indicators when they design

453
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,480
their defenses we also think that our

454
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,550
approach is flexible and allows for the

455
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,110
allocation of limited resources because

456
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,550
it helps defenders to focus their

457
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,810
resources on the particular threat

458
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,349
actors that are most likely to target

459
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,880
them in our future work we will

460
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,000
elaborate on each of those four steps

461
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,350
and work more on the different methods

462
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,440
and predictive analytics that could be

463
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,600
applied to improve each of those four

464
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,060
steps and we'll also look at more case

465
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,040
studies where we can apply our framework

466
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,540
so thank you for attention and let's

467
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,520
keep bears and similar creatures out of

468
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,119
our systems I look forward to your

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,470
questions

470
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,698
yeah let's stop at the Q&A station and

471
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,240
until then I'll just keep invading your

472
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,240
seat and

473
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,699
any questions I have any questions

474
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,699
please yeah there's a gentleman

475
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,220
thank you good afternoon my name is Hong

476
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,860
Lee I work over at National Defense

477
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,170
University in Washington DC the question

478
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,409
I have is that your indicators and

479
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,000
warnings is limited to at the

480
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:48,500
organizational level or have you looked

481
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,500
at inw at a national scale that that

482
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,480
decision-makers at you know in a country

483
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:59,850
that there are certain inw that they can

484
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,470
see to indicate a large-scale attack so

485
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,179
traditionally that's a good question

486
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,100
traditionally an W has been applied in

487
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,380
that manner for example to detect

488
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,480
missile launches or military

489
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,100
mobilizations of certain countries in

490
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,870
our particular approach who are trying

491
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,399
to focus it to organizations only

492
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,760
because we're trying to be specific and

493
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,070
also one of the main reasons why we

494
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,690
started this project was to see how it

495
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,060
can how such an approach can be applied

496
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,710
in practice and also we're going to try

497
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,409
to keep our publications and other

498
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,980
information that we we released on this

499
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,500
matter

500
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:37,260
publicly available and also unclassified

501
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,770
so that would be my answer any other

502
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,770
questions

503
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,380
okay maybe I can use this chance to ask

504
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,000
my question and I'm really curious about

505
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,860
the methodology that you use for the

506
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,490
research actually so could you maybe

507
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,870
address that so we started by conducting

508
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,170
a systematic literature review of

509
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,510
relevant databases we looked at I Triple

510
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,250
E and the web of science in JSTOR with a

511
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,270
lot of articles on the topic that were

512
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,610
relevant to our work we also looked at

513
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,010
military doctrine and cyber doctrine of

514
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,750
different NATO member states and finally

515
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,280
we also conducted interviews with US

516
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,260
government officials and members of the

517
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,620
private sector from Maryland United

518
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,950
States but also we conducted interviews

519
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,800
with experts cyber security experts at

520
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,130
companies that work internationally

521
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,610
thank you

522
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,240
and if we don't have any questions thank

523
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:38,270
you Liana

524
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:40,820
and all yours so our next speaker is

525
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,860
senior captain Alvin ory from CCDC OE

526
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,510
he's working as a researcher at the

527
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,209
central strategy branch currently

528
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,650
periodic current task he was serving at

529
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,440
the Belgian military Cyber Security

530
00:19:48,650 --> 00:20:00,220
Operations Center so Arvin the floor is

531
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:02,900
yours thank you Sam so welcome everybody

532
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,210
since I'm from the CCS UE is small like

533
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,860
a home game so I'll try to tell you

534
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,510
something about recommendations for

535
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,090
hunting the results of cyber effects

536
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:16,180
cyber facts or cyber operations

537
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,179
offensive cyber means first I'm gonna

538
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,690
tell you a little bit why we did this

539
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,580
research this is not really part of the

540
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,040
research but it gives an ID why we were

541
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,449
investigating this offensive cyber it's

542
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,060
getting more and more attention and NATO

543
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,760
and Western countries it has been for a

544
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,590
long time quite article not correct to

545
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,720
think or to use offensive cyber means

546
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,520
but know more and more nations are

547
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,920
getting to the point that if it's used

548
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,650
in an international law context that

549
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,340
it's legally correct we can use

550
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,810
offensive cyber means to guard keep

551
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,240
sovereignty of a country for example

552
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,770
for example we have this access

553
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,140
crosswords which we always called

554
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,790
penetration testing exercise but since

555
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,700
this year we called training on

556
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,280
offensive cyber capabilities at the AGP

557
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,320
320 for NATO which is a cyberspace

558
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,260
doctrine and the earliest versions are

559
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,330
the only ideas about defensive cybers

560
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,670
aspects and the latest version nations

561
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,919
agreed that we could have voluntary

562
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:20,460
contribution of offensive or cyber

563
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,290
effects this is impossible important

564
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,320
trigger so we can have some phenom ii

565
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,720
like hack back or using cyber means to

566
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,270
respond to kinetic attacks or vice versa

567
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,860
this could increase deterrence or maybe

568
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:36,420
not I sometimes try to make in

569
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,780
comparison with Special Forces some

570
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,100
nation gives some effect by Special

571
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,170
Forces but you don't know where they are

572
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,820
how do you proceed how many they are you

573
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:49,110
just rely on the effect they're

574
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:52,350
producing so I had some research

575
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,449
questions first one was how to enhance

576
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,679
the decision-making process for cyber

577
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:01,020
effects like us we told plenty of times

578
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,320
this during those last days we don't own

579
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,120
cyberspace we own parts of its small

580
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,899
parts but which parametres do we control

581
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,959
and which varmints aren't we can we

582
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,490
predict the outcome of a cyber affect

583
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,970
are we sure what's the level of

584
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,800
certainty that this will happen can we

585
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,640
predict that it can measure the outcome

586
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,450
we do something

587
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,610
is it possible to to measure what is

588
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,830
done and last but not least maybe the

589
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,510
most important question we have is what

590
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,129
to do to integrate cyber effects as a

591
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,390
lateral support from one nation to an

592
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,930
organization or from one nation to

593
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,490
another nation so I divided my paper in

594
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,100
two parts step one is the measure in

595
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:44,310
protecting the cyber effects and the

596
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,040
step two is will be the execution of the

597
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,750
of the effects first important thing I

598
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,210
think we should make is the order of

599
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,160
effects we got a first order second

600
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,380
order third order of effects first order

601
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,920
is typically something which happens in

602
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:02,029
an organization in a factory in for a

603
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,019
mission which happened in the IT domain

604
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,549
afterwards we can go to second-order

605
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,559
effects which is still the same mission

606
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:10,230
the same organization that it goes to

607
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,119
outside the boundaries of IT and the

608
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,700
third level effects our long-term

609
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,860
effects are maybe changing people's

610
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,110
behavior changing public opinion chain

611
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,809
having financial impact International

612
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,959
Relations to give you an example of

613
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,820
these three levels of these three orders

614
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,850
of effects if you take the not petty

615
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,129
attacks in 2017 the first-order effect

616
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,498
would be just hacking the software which

617
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:36,748
was a taxpaying software new cream the

618
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:39,389
second-order effects would be complet

619
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,739
marks Eustace this software could

620
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:42,649
totally be breached and they didn't had

621
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:45,840
any operations anymore and are able to

622
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:47,609
know the ships were to do any operations

623
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,678
and the third level effect would be

624
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,389
something like nations at reaching out

625
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,549
other nations so some nations at which

626
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,129
Russia for the attack I think the US

627
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,139
also did some financial impact

628
00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:01,918
measurements so these are third level of

629
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:05,090
effects secondly we have cognitive and

630
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,739
physical effects cognitive is more

631
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,109
changing people's minds intervening with

632
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:12,359
elections influence operations stealing

633
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:13,918
information and we got physical effects

634
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,460
like we saw unstructured for example

635
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,999
where we physically modified some

636
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:26,009
hardware to to disrupt a system then we

637
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:29,129
got measuring the effects measuring the

638
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:31,499
effects are more like questions one

639
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:33,149
should ask themselves is it possible to

640
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:35,279
measure afterwards disturbs in the

641
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:37,590
system or just do something and I don't

642
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,539
even know if it has happened is it

643
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,039
possible to measure the first order of X

644
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,899
or we have to wait for second-order

645
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,799
effects or maybe only third order

646
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:50,309
effects other possibly impacts on my own

647
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,009
mission if I execute cyber operations of

648
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:56,519
cyber effects the next step is

649
00:24:53,009 --> 00:25:00,119
estimating the effects for estimating

650
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,539
effects one might try something in a in

651
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,939
at home we reproduce target system and

652
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,730
we try to build it and attack it and see

653
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,559
what happens but systems nowadays are

654
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,710
systems of systems interconnected so

655
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,270
most probably or test setup will not

656
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,980
completely match with a real

657
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,540
set up and you know and mostly we don't

658
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,520
even know what the real setup is because

659
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,700
people changing software patching

660
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,420
updating so it's very difficult to to

661
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,790
estimate or to replicate how to to copy

662
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,580
the the target system

663
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:35,370
we don't have enough test data tested I

664
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,620
was probably highly secure or highly

665
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,209
protected we don't share information

666
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,580
about this one so it's going to be

667
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:46,020
difficult to estimate the outcome and

668
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,760
like I said before one of the main

669
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,650
problems we have to in the very

670
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,020
sensitive nature at least nation states

671
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,330
think it is very sensitive we keep this

672
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,980
information for ourselves we got very

673
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,199
good sharing of information nowadays on

674
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,470
the defensive side and criminals and

675
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,960
hackers and financial gain mostly in

676
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,660
dark web sharing information but on a

677
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,790
nation state level we are not yet area

678
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:13,290
to share this kind of more sensitive

679
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:15,899
information and on one which is very few

680
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:19,260
researched almost nothing - how do we

681
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,470
estimate collateral damage what if we do

682
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,750
a cyber effect - cyber operation and

683
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:27,930
unintentionally we changed data if it's

684
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,230
personal data it's causing injury or

685
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:33,210
loss of life

686
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,250
what if it's due and we penetrate

687
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,750
friendly forces which we don't know they

688
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,760
use the same system the same operating

689
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:44,430
system of or whatever

690
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:46,500
- can we estimate third or second or

691
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,640
even third order effects can we know of

692
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,310
the political outcomes or editing and if

693
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,890
we have a vulnerability which we make an

694
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,710
expert for and we don't fix it because

695
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,950
we might use it or ancestors might be

696
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,870
vulnerable to use later on how

697
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,380
vulnerable our own systems if somebody

698
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:09,929
else figure out the same vulnerability

699
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,700
so those questions should be asked I

700
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:17,280
think before we start thinking about

701
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,840
cyber effects then dependencies you see

702
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,920
from bottom to top

703
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,139
we got increasing threats and risks the

704
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,350
size of the circle is the most the

705
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,750
importance of this of the

706
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:33,419
and military see - since in reown we can

707
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,760
change modify harden do whatever we want

708
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,910
with a figure we also need military

709
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,170
operations which we are using

710
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,390
contractors that can infrastructure from

711
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,760
the host nation so things we are not

712
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,740
controlling so well but the ultimate

713
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,390
goal is to have our mission and our

714
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,680
mission depends on so many things we are

715
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,200
the military do not control

716
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,400
so energy medical financial

717
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,100
transportation so that's what makes

718
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,560
cyber very different the main of

719
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,919
operations and while it's harder with

720
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,270
its advantages and disadvantages so if

721
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,260
we go and look for information

722
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,600
environment

723
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,460
we might do some information warfare the

724
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,730
information warfare means information

725
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,010
operations information operations are

726
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,120
multiple and just to give an ID that we

727
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,879
have to take in consideration all of

728
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,530
those we have electronic warfare which

729
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,850
we all know for decades we using this

730
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,120
store there's nothing special that is a

731
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:26,149
part of information war operations then

732
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,870
we got some very specific not

733
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,450
subcategory but and there's another

734
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,729
limited list there are much more like at

735
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,650
intelligence we get psychological

736
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,920
operations which also a part of the

737
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,420
information operations and then only one

738
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:46,080
part is the computer network operations

739
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:48,300
the real cyber effects so come to step

740
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,220
two which are achieving the effects I

741
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,440
use terminology which are very familiar

742
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,900
from hopefully for most military people

743
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,670
is the n's ways and means to achieve a

744
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,460
goal

745
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,130
first thing is spillover so we invented

746
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,110
this tactical operational strategic and

747
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,380
political means to have a good control

748
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:10,010
command and control system we have but

749
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,260
we have seen that certainly in in cyber

750
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:16,680
cyber ways as well defenders offense we

751
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,540
see spillover so strategic actions can

752
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,390
have political ends or from operational

753
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,820
to strategic or political but even quite

754
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,860
easily from tactical base to higher ends

755
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,350
and not saying it's not happening in

756
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,010
traditional warfare and land maritime or

757
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:34,830
air space but it's just much easier

758
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,870
let's say that for example we the level

759
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,570
of decision goes to the strategic coming

760
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,219
out of the tactical command a tactical

761
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,129
cell hacks a mailbox and

762
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,960
box plans to be an important someone who

763
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,760
has impact on political level a

764
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,340
strategic action which might be very

765
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,919
easy to hack can have very easy

766
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,799
political outcomes so that's something

767
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,620
we should take in mind then we have a

768
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:01,650
functional view this is more to explain

769
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,530
that cyber effects and not going alone

770
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,169
we have to take this as a whole and have

771
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,600
every little aspect studied before we go

772
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:11,220
to that real cyber operations so we get

773
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,870
psyops and deception

774
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,460
typically exams are leaflets and fall

775
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,039
targets yeah like I said we have a

776
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,679
chronic warfare typically we just Cham

777
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,070
things so they're not which and humans

778
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,110
of like magnetic energy and and the

779
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,330
adversary is stopped working we have the

780
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,668
traditional signal intelligence where we

781
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,590
can eavesdropping and then come cyber

782
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:33,659
operations and cyber operations has

783
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,090
interference but electronic warfare like

784
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,100
spoofing and telecasts protocol based

785
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,408
attacks we can have direction-finding

786
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,539
antennas to find where the adversary is

787
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:44,850
and we've got cyber network operations

788
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:47,039
and then we got this mix of a whole

789
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,280
lecture only four or five seconds cyber

790
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,039
operations going from web spam email

791
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,230
personal message delivery cyber network

792
00:30:53,039 --> 00:31:00,870
exploration and the very typical cyber

793
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:04,620
network attacks so next thing is toughs

794
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:07,320
in cyberspace NIST has also something

795
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,389
like this but I've made it more a little

796
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,280
more military version of it we should

797
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,409
protect our own systems and if we're not

798
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,899
able to protect it at least detect that

799
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:17,610
somebody infiltrating our systems and if

800
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,590
we detect it we can have to defend our

801
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,658
systems against the attacker and in

802
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,049
worst case scenario if the attacker

803
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:27,059
breached our systems we have to recover

804
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:29,610
only if we're very good at this one we

805
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,010
might consider doing the effects but

806
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,049
like I said in the beginning we might

807
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:36,360
consider hack back but the opponent does

808
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:39,179
the same so before we go to the next

809
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,158
step be sure we have defended of systems

810
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,990
which be easy if we have only to defend

811
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,720
our military systems but I said before

812
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:48,150
it's a whole realm of different actors

813
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,250
in this field so if your nation state or

814
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,870
an ally has some kind of vulnerability

815
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,419
which also take care of this

816
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:58,149
so that's easier said than done

817
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:01,390
and then cyber effects can be physical

818
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:04,120
like make a system unavailable disruptor

819
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:07,030
system can be digital like leaking

820
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,989
information corrupting files corrupting

821
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,870
databases can be an economic

822
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:17,110
manipulation influence operations can be

823
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:19,379
psychological sorry manipulation

824
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,490
influences of course psychological

825
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,039
disrupted economicus processes are

826
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,350
economical of course

827
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:31,390
can we reputation damage international

828
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:34,000
relationships and can be societal or

829
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:37,690
social like the change of public opinion

830
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,730
so it seems that cyber effects might be

831
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,289
the best tool for specific goals and

832
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,140
might be the worst tool for other ones

833
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,900
and that's what cyber effects made them

834
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:50,409
so special different than the other

835
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:53,740
domains of operations so the reason

836
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:55,780
means to have good side effects it

837
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,419
depends on a lot of things this is not

838
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:01,299
limited list but it lends on vacation of

839
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:03,070
the society or levels of university to

840
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:06,158
make people that actually can do this

841
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,820
cyber fight makes in GDP on the grand

842
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,100
strategy and we have ways where is a not

843
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,760
typical cyber but we can have a lot

844
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,439
longer than strategic information or

845
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,140
intelligence collection reduction of

846
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,179
logistics and then we have means in this

847
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:25,120
case means our cyber means we can have

848
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:27,280
insider support social engineering a lot

849
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,639
of those things are the means we can use

850
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,639
in cyber to achieve this of course the

851
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,500
defending side will use measurements for

852
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,929
measures with these measures to defend

853
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,630
the systems like hardening the systems

854
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:43,150
control over users then there are also a

855
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,799
again ways around like if you crypt

856
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,990
encrypt your systems we might be used

857
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,490
quantum computing to bypass the

858
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,190
encryption we can have social

859
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,470
engineering to buy us certain systems so

860
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:57,840
it's a whole complex system and we have

861
00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:00,090
to take in account all of those and then

862
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,290
collaborations in cyber operations I

863
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,000
think it's very well known that not

864
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,549
every nation are the same capabilities

865
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,349
not for defense and certainly not for

866
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:10,299
offense so those are willingness

867
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:12,669
from from within nation NATO at least

868
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,679
from Nations to support other nations of

869
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:18,248
the sport a coalition with providing

870
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:23,190
voluntary server effects but we've seen

871
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:26,589
so that the operational details of those

872
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:28,749
effects are very difficult to share for

873
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,489
example if a one zero day vulnerability

874
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:32,498
and I share it somebody else can use it

875
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:33,999
probably it's worthless because somebody

876
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:35,618
else she uses it

877
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:38,049
hopefully industry will patch it at some

878
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,069
point or somebody else uses I'm not able

879
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:42,639
to use it anymore

880
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:45,248
so it's very very difficult to share

881
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,819
information it's also a matter of trust

882
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:51,428
what do you do if you don't know which

883
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:54,788
weapons I have and you don't know how

884
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,259
strong they are how many I have so but

885
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:58,150
you're still sending your troops based

886
00:34:56,259 --> 00:35:01,769
on somebody else who's promising

887
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,769
something but you don't know what it is

888
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,308
so coalition partners must be informed

889
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,710
of capabilities to understand expect

890
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:11,049
cyber effects to estimate both

891
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,589
probability of success and the expected

892
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:17,069
collateral damage so and finally I have

893
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:21,749
a few recommendations in my paper dust

894
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:21,749
all more but I wanted to highlight those

895
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:28,710
we should talk non IT non cyber language

896
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:31,058
to exist for many years definitely NATO

897
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,009
terminology which everybody understands

898
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:37,180
let's keep the data knowledge like

899
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:40,180
disrupt retail delay do not use

900
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,390
technical IT terms it will be very

901
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,558
confusing cyber can be very fast to

902
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,328
click on the button and the virus

903
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,009
spreads and millisecond later than the

904
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:50,289
other side of the world but the planning

905
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:52,299
process is much harder if you have to

906
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:54,640
find the vulnerability the exploit

907
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:57,369
having the right people who can do so so

908
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,170
you need to plan this in the beginning

909
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:04,150
of the operations and not just add on at

910
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:06,460
the end cyber is a very technical weapon

911
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,469
so we need to train people we just have

912
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,469
to hire people maybe install from some

913
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:13,479
physical things having toolbox so it

914
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,160
needs long-term planning so a government

915
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:17,468
should have this morning in just a two

916
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,569
or three years program we should we all

917
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:21,560
probably don't have enough resources to

918
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:23,750
everything so maybe take few

919
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,650
and do them well but there should be a

920
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,390
long-term planning on a political level

921
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:33,100
so this concludes my briefing so if any

922
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:36,580
questions I'm happy to answer yeah

923
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,580
any questions

924
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,880
to be any

925
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,670
I have a question that was my chance to

926
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:51,280
ask my question

927
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:53,800
no one has okay my question active mode

928
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,480
it's a long run actually but appropriate

929
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,760
answers short like cyber operations and

930
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,260
a little support considering that and I

931
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,150
in an environment with many to many

932
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,170
relationships like considering the

933
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,010
Allied nations how do you project that

934
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:12,010
operational commander a tactical

935
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,920
commander can know what kind of cyber

936
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:18,280
effect to request he picks out of a

937
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:22,750
portfolio or or the alight nations can

938
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,330
you know unlocked when in that case how

939
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:29,800
does he know that this Sabra that can

940
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:32,529
fit in any area or in any target I think

941
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,050
NATO is is struggling with the same

942
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,170
problem and also supporting food for

943
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,270
thought actually nativist is having an

944
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,210
at least at define the road

945
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:45,490
they created Sayaka take I created for

946
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:48,880
me some memories which will be permanent

947
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:50,350
or temporary in NATO which have

948
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,840
technological background and to know

949
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,940
what capabilities and nations have to

950
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,740
have in close community to discuss this

951
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,510
kind of topic but then I think it's a

952
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,729
problem with NATO faces nowadays and

953
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,730
they're working hard to solve this this

954
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,490
very difficult problem of sharing of

955
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,110
information not telling too much it's

956
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:13,899
still enough to have confidence in each

957
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:16,170
other yeah I think we have a question

958
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,170
from

959
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:24,369
yeah Thank You Brad Bigelow from from

960
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:25,899
shape first of all it's not in any of

961
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,140
your slides but it seems like you're

962
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,779
presuming that all cyber effects are

963
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,328
offensive first of all in terms of

964
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:37,660
application of operational practice I

965
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:40,989
would argue that the reality is a vast

966
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:43,899
majority of militarily relevant op cyber

967
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:45,910
effects are going to be defensive for

968
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,819
probably quite a long time to come

969
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,649
so first of all I think it's important

970
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:54,699
that when we look at planning these as

971
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:57,249
capabilities that we recognize actually

972
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:59,890
we have most of the toolbox today and we

973
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:03,819
know what that toolbox is but we need to

974
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:06,670
figure out how we use those to employ

975
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:11,079
from a maximizing operational effects

976
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:14,380
standpoint I think it's also critical to

977
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:17,170
understand that details of what

978
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:20,439
individual cyber capabilities offensive

979
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:23,650
are going to be very limited in not in

980
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:26,739
access for a long time to come I think

981
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,630
that's a reality we understand so some

982
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,579
progress has been made to accept that's

983
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,369
there but how it's going to actually be

984
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:38,499
employed is going to be it's going to

985
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:41,170
take some time to develop and it doesn't

986
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:43,238
help to exaggerate what the magnitude of

987
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,789
the impacts of cyber offensive cyber

988
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:48,549
effects are going to be you know if you

989
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:52,179
simply look at what's available in free

990
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:54,369
press open press buy however mechanism

991
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:57,009
it's gotten out into the wild you'll

992
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:58,689
find the capabilities and the best

993
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:02,439
example is the molar report which is

994
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:05,670
rich with our array information and what

995
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:08,949
you find is it's the dumbest cheapest

996
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:12,219
sort of hacker 101 things that they're

997
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:14,170
taking advantage of which actually is

998
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:16,150
the good news of that is those things

999
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,059
are still effective and they're probably

1000
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,799
going to be militarily effective so I

1001
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,410
III think this is a great effort but I

1002
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:26,079
think it needs to be taken forward out

1003
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,618
of theory into operational practice and

1004
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,939
how do you see that happening I mean

1005
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,910
you've made a good start here but where

1006
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:34,930
do you see going with this

1007
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,799
and thank you for your question sir I

1008
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,629
think it's an excellent question like I

1009
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,220
said in the beginning I'm a research for

1010
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,190
CCDC UE so we are more like an

1011
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,730
independent think-tank this paper is not

1012
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,200
a solution how to do it it's more like a

1013
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,880
Food for Thought paper to open

1014
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,980
discussions to have a discussion on

1015
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,530
things which for the moment may not have

1016
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,690
been discussed so openly so invite you

1017
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,870
to to have a more open discussion so we

1018
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,660
can find a common way how to proceed in

1019
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,460
to see to which extent we can have some

1020
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,920
of these theoretical IDs in practical

1021
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,690
terms that do what we sir that it's far

1022
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:16,210
for tomorrow that we will have this

1023
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:17,970
perfect in place I think we have room

1024
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,600
for one more question before this

1025
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,600
continent the next speaker

1026
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:34,980
okay thank you so much for being now

1027
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,859
getting into details our next speaker is

1028
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,109
my previous senior colleague captain

1029
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,910
bullish again - cam currently working as

1030
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:44,730
plans Blanchette at cyberspace

1031
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,170
operations center at shape previously he

1032
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,579
was working at the Turkish Navy Research

1033
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,099
Center command at various levels

1034
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:53,460
focusing on development and program

1035
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:57,780
management of c4isr for naval systems so

1036
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:00,660
stay tuned thank you very much can I

1037
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,030
walk just this one alright good

1038
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,220
afternoon everyone my name is Barry

1039
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:08,070
Scheck I'm an ex-con I'm a Turkish Navy

1040
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,980
captain in shape in the CyArk cyberspace

1041
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,530
operation center and my current job is

1042
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,810
the plants branch at there it's always a

1043
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,910
challenge to take the floor after the

1044
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,589
most attractive topic of the NATO

1045
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,500
cyberspace operations which is the

1046
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:24,630
offensive cyber basically and especially

1047
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,730
if I'm gonna talk about the ugly side of

1048
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,700
the cyberspace which is vulnerabilities

1049
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:32,640
risks challenges problems and all other

1050
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,859
bad stuff it's gonna be a niche topic

1051
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,970
today I will be talking about I will

1052
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,130
talking about the commercial

1053
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,290
off-the-shelf products hardware and

1054
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,390
software and the challenges that comes

1055
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:46,319
with those cots equipment that we are

1056
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:50,069
using I will try to create a story like

1057
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,680
in a what so what and know what sequence

1058
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:54,390
in the what section or will give some

1059
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,250
much factual information and like a

1060
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:59,098
gives them like a the problem statement

1061
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,230
basically in this so what section you

1062
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,930
will hear why this problem relevant to

1063
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,940
us why should we care about that and in

1064
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,828
the know what section are we going to

1065
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,740
deal with that basically a couple of

1066
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:15,720
recommendations to react on it all right

1067
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,279
so as you can see on the slides on the

1068
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,339
left-hand side of the slide there are

1069
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,619
many advantages of using the commercial

1070
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:25,740
off-the-shelf equipments hardware and

1071
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,210
software in our military systems most of

1072
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,669
them are derived from the cost

1073
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:32,569
efficiency we love them and we use them

1074
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,970
at the maximum extent as you can see in

1075
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:38,099
1994 the United States the the

1076
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:41,578
Secretary of the Department of Defense

1077
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,829
highly recommended to move away from the

1078
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,349
military standards and meal specs and

1079
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:48,329
rather use the international standards

1080
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:50,880
industry standards in our military

1081
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:52,619
systems and specifically they

1082
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,869
recommended to use the commercial

1083
00:43:52,619 --> 00:44:00,390
off-the-shelf products hardware and

1084
00:43:54,869 --> 00:44:02,940
software in the military systems that

1085
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:05,788
coincides with the end of the Cold War

1086
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,880
basically after the Cold War the focus

1087
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:10,260
also shifted from the military

1088
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,900
investments into the much more on the

1089
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,170
consumer market investments the money

1090
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,990
started changing hands and that created

1091
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:22,049
a very competitive very fierce market

1092
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,450
conditions to force the producers to

1093
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:26,910
come up with quick solutions for the

1094
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,160
consumer needs they need to come up with

1095
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,078
new products look at your iPhone's how

1096
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,700
often you're changing them basically

1097
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,010
look at your applications best

1098
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,288
applications in your favorite how often

1099
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,420
you're changing them so the one who get

1100
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:42,059
into the market early gets the market

1101
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:46,289
basically and gets like a benefit out of

1102
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:49,319
it and that forced the product life

1103
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:52,890
cycle of this consumer market to shrink

1104
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:54,480
into two to five years and also like at

1105
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,490
the Bill of material to put the code

1106
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,270
software and the hardware that's made up

1107
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:02,339
of the Sega the code the consumer

1108
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,619
products also shrink to the two to five

1109
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:07,049
years or when you look at that in the

1110
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:10,650
military side we use the same hardware

1111
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:12,869
and software in our military systems but

1112
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,599
our military systems have a longer

1113
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:16,890
product lifecycle like 20 years to the

1114
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,069
year for the year

1115
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,990
yesterday we heard b-52s are a very

1116
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:25,259
strong part of our deterrence posture

1117
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:27,390
and there are almost 70 years old and

1118
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,839
we're still using them and they're still

1119
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:32,970
effective as of the first day but we

1120
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,069
need to find a good way a better way to

1121
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:37,558
come up with the solutions how we're

1122
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:40,259
going to maintain those military systems

1123
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,569
with like a 20 40 50 years of product

1124
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,089
life cycle when we have only two years

1125
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:48,930
for the glidecycle costs equipment in

1126
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:50,279
the very center of those systems

1127
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,270
and you know what we are not the only

1128
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,850
ones in the middle in this problem set

1129
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:59,400
nuclear plans the transportation system

1130
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,980
there are V onyx the the railway

1131
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,140
stations they are all sharing the same

1132
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:09,360
problem just like we do so at this time

1133
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,960
let me tell you a story from my own life

1134
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,400
as Issa mentioned I was before shape I

1135
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,860
was in Turkey in the Turkish Navy

1136
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,100
Research Center command and we were

1137
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,830
developing various c4isr systems there I

1138
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,710
mean in one of those projects we have

1139
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,270
developed a new state of art cutting

1140
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,520
edge technology commander control

1141
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,170
systems for one of our free gates so

1142
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,270
what we did effectively is like a tear

1143
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,700
down the ship get rid of the like of the

1144
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,310
legacy system and put them put it in

1145
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,020
completely new system it looks like a

1146
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,600
strong traction basically for the

1147
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,700
operators after the old one and we were

1148
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,890
so proud after the delivery of this

1149
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:49,049
product of the two years of the

1150
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,779
deployment we got a phone call from the

1151
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,610
shipyard sir I'm calling from the

1152
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,130
shipyard so what's the problem

1153
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:58,260
so keyboard in one of the consoles in

1154
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:01,770
this modernized ships is broken

1155
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,470
basically what can I do then change it

1156
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:06,210
with another one well we did but

1157
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,149
unfortunately it's all depleted there is

1158
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:11,190
no work nothing else in the stocks then

1159
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,560
go to the procurement agency and get new

1160
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,540
ones from the original vendor well sir

1161
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,460
we did the same we went to the original

1162
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,980
vendor we asked for the keyboard and

1163
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,020
they said they don't have any basically

1164
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,810
because they stopped the production line

1165
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,190
for this keyboard what do you mean so

1166
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,080
they're not in the keyboard business no

1167
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,120
no they're in the keyboard business they

1168
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,430
have better keyboards but it's not fully

1169
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,730
back compatible and we just cannot take

1170
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,480
it and put it in place for the old one

1171
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,130
what do you mean it's not that

1172
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,420
comfortable they have changed the specs

1173
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,250
they have changed the signs they have

1174
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,800
changed the API some calls are

1175
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:46,110
deprecated some electrical connections

1176
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,740
are changed so we are not using the new

1177
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:52,620
one basically so after two years of the

1178
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:55,950
deployment of cutting-edge technology

1179
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,900
commander control systems we ended up

1180
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,029
with something that we cannot use it

1181
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,030
basically we didn't think the

1182
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:06,240
obsolescence in our design phase

1183
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,430
as one of the problem sets so in that

1184
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,069
day I realized that that's a great

1185
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,440
research topic area so I started my PhD

1186
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:16,980
on this one so back in time there was

1187
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,590
only two objectives for me one is the

1188
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,800
increased cost because it costs a lot

1189
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:25,980
for us to come up with a new solution

1190
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,500
due to all VMB recertify the system and

1191
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,290
redeploy it again so it was an

1192
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,930
uncultivated maintenance cost on top of

1193
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:36,390
the overall project cost for us in

1194
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,850
addition to that since this console

1195
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:40,950
cannot be used it has decreased the

1196
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:43,319
operational efficiency of this ship as

1197
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,169
well so those were the only two

1198
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,660
objectives that I started to work after

1199
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,430
that I was assigned to shape in the

1200
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,040
cyberspace operation center back in time

1201
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:55,529
it was the J cyber cyber division

1202
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,990
starting as of last year like a V became

1203
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,360
a cyber space operations center it's

1204
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,700
part of my business my job over there I

1205
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,160
received the vulnerability assessments

1206
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,129
reports so it comes on a periodic manner

1207
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,259
to me and I realize that there are a lot

1208
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:13,320
of vulnerabilities in our systems and

1209
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,730
thanks agency they're fixing it they're

1210
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,320
patching it they're trying to keep up

1211
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,890
with the pace of these vulnerabilities

1212
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,500
but the numbers are huge if you look at

1213
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,720
this slide over the like an almost 20

1214
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,180
year course of this the vulnerabilities

1215
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,709
there are tens of thousands of

1216
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,640
vulnerabilities that have been

1217
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,170
identified in the software and almost

1218
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,230
all of them are commercial off-the-shelf

1219
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:40,620
software which probably you all use them

1220
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,440
in your systems that needs to be patched

1221
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,839
by the way and it's just the tip of the

1222
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,180
iceberg those are the ones that we know

1223
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,410
there is a huge punch unknown unknowns

1224
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,500
probably like the more vulnerabilities

1225
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,810
that we don't even know basically so

1226
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,660
this is the problem set the third aspect

1227
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:03,540
of the problem set because all those

1228
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,940
vulnerabilities if they are not patch

1229
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,460
they will stay in our systems and you

1230
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:11,220
know what if you have a codes in your

1231
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,160
system one day or another it will be

1232
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,169
obsolete it's a matter of time for the

1233
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,058
original vendor to call it obsolete

1234
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:20,700
not for Microsoft for the main operating

1235
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,740
systems it's about ten years but for the

1236
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,759
other vendors it changes from two to

1237
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,250
five years basically

1238
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,650
and once it's called obsolete you are

1239
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:31,740
not going to get support anymore for

1240
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,799
this software and you are not going to

1241
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,899
get any patch for this software and if

1242
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:39,359
there is a vulnerability identified in

1243
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,940
those software this is not going to be

1244
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,808
fixed and you will have to come up with

1245
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,460
a solution basic before this one and if

1246
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,470
you when you look at the old like a

1247
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,230
configuration management process or the

1248
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:54,000
patch management process probably most

1249
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:57,780
of your patch management process are

1250
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,760
triggered by an event and this trigger

1251
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,380
is most of the time that the vendor is

1252
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,960
pushing down the patch for you and

1253
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,780
that's the time that the process starts

1254
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,140
if vendor does not push down a patch for

1255
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,690
you

1256
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,759
you just wait idle basically and you

1257
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:14,339
have to live with that only if you're

1258
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,260
super good and proactively looking at

1259
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:21,450
all vulnerabilities and try to mitigate

1260
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:24,990
the problem by yourself so that was the

1261
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:28,279
third problem set that I needed to

1262
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:31,919
address in the obsolescence management

1263
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:34,079
so we are not the only one in here

1264
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,180
military is just one of them when you

1265
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,130
look at this map energy sector

1266
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:40,379
transportation financial sector the

1267
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:43,380
communication sector all these critical

1268
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:47,069
infrastructures are subject the same

1269
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:50,880
threat of the obsolescence the unpatched

1270
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:53,190
vulnerabilities that is either there

1271
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,680
because of a sloppy design sloppy

1272
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:59,579
implementation and a sloppy check unit

1273
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,390
test verification or intentionally

1274
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:07,559
seeded in there to be exploited sometime

1275
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:10,410
in the future so this could easily lead

1276
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:15,059
into a national security problem if it's

1277
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:17,460
not properly addressed so this is what

1278
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:21,380
and so on we got a problem so we got to

1279
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,660
solve it so in our proposal we have a

1280
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,309
comprehensive approach that proposing

1281
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,500
lega to address this problem at two

1282
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,060
layer at the top layer is a governance

1283
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,100
they are basically the minute

1284
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,930
justice problems I had a chance to look

1285
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,870
at the quite number of the policy

1286
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,810
documents the directives the strategic

1287
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:43,380
documents thanks to the CD series

1288
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:45,960
database on this one every nation state

1289
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:49,020
strategy document is touching the

1290
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,260
importance of protecting their critical

1291
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,630
infrastructures this is good but when it

1292
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,550
comes to look at this unique problem the

1293
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,960
COTS equipments and look at the big

1294
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:02,910
impact that they can create it is almost

1295
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,370
not mentioned in any of the strategy

1296
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:08,490
doctrine or policy documents in our hand

1297
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:10,290
so at the governance level we can add

1298
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,899
this like a point out this problem and

1299
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:15,360
like a change our directives look at the

1300
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,830
strategy and policy documents obviously

1301
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,830
we need a whole-of-government approach

1302
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:22,350
we need like a proactive strategies as

1303
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:24,420
well as the reactive strategies we may

1304
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:26,610
need some like essential consulting

1305
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,830
agencies to orchestrate the best

1306
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,740
practices among different sectors and

1307
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:33,270
change exchange them among each other

1308
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,430
which includes the public-private

1309
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,620
collaboration we might need some help

1310
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,620
from the academia to give us a better

1311
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:43,259
estimation techniques for the rule for

1312
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:47,279
the cause of solises in the software's

1313
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:50,340
or core software's and also we might

1314
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,010
need like a point out the governing the

1315
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:57,180
supply chain basically because this

1316
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:59,970
supply chain in your systems can be very

1317
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:03,149
well easily become part of your kill

1318
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:06,000
chain if it's not properly managed at

1319
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:08,880
the governance level that's all I'm

1320
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,070
gonna say on this manner at the

1321
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,250
management level there are very

1322
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:16,260
proactive and reactive measures that you

1323
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,880
can follow some of them are listed on

1324
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,040
the slide and the details are in the

1325
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:24,030
paper for your reading pleasure that I

1326
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,920
got it from the US cert and the GCHQ so

1327
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,890
there are many like a mitigation

1328
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,980
techniques that you can use but at the

1329
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:34,049
management level we need to follow a

1330
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,480
balanced solution because we are dealing

1331
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:39,240
with different community of interest in

1332
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,150
this manner at one part the operational

1333
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,919
community is trying to get the best the

1334
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,910
best benefit out of this

1335
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,400
all they care is to get the job done no

1336
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:52,109
matter what it is basically I came from

1337
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,960
our operational community this is what I

1338
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:56,848
cared for get the job done with but on

1339
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,489
the other hand the budget holders and

1340
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:01,980
the service providers they are trying to

1341
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:04,650
keep it in a manageable level they are

1342
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,200
trying to minimize the cost because the

1343
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,809
money the fundings are not endless it's

1344
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,700
not infinite so they don't care as much

1345
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,589
as like the operational efficiencies

1346
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,839
that the operational community has they

1347
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:19,529
all care like a much more on the funding

1348
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:22,529
side the budget side and recently but we

1349
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:24,450
are sitting over here there's a security

1350
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:26,099
community of interest and they are

1351
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:29,549
carrying much more of the security of

1352
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,380
this like the the systems so they want

1353
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:33,210
to have like a less vulnerable T's they

1354
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,819
want to have like a maximum cyberspace

1355
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,640
security in our systems and you know

1356
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:40,160
what all these three objectives

1357
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,930
maximizing operational efficiency

1358
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,089
minimizing the costs and maximizing the

1359
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,129
cyberspace security they are all

1360
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:49,739
conflicting each other in terms of the

1361
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:51,989
solutions that they're asking for so in

1362
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:54,650
that manner then we have to find a

1363
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:57,809
balanced solution that meets all

1364
00:55:54,650 --> 00:56:02,430
objectives actually or that upsets all

1365
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:06,749
objectives accruing all right so in this

1366
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:08,999
manner our proposal is to approach it as

1367
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:11,308
a multi objective decision making

1368
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:13,200
problem with different objectives at

1369
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:16,650
this time we have only three objectives

1370
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,868
but it's scalable basically to maximize

1371
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:21,749
efficiency maximize security and

1372
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:24,720
minimize the cost to end up with a set

1373
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:28,319
of Perito optimal solution sets which is

1374
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,359
not dominating each other and let the

1375
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:33,480
decision maker to pick one of them

1376
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:37,049
depending on his or her preference and

1377
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:40,670
priority so in this slide you can see

1378
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:43,799
just a one use case that two software

1379
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:47,400
have been called obsolete so we got

1380
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:51,390
three solution in the pareto set the

1381
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,769
decision variables are the which

1382
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,328
mitigation technique that we're going to

1383
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:56,368
use and what time we're going to apply

1384
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:57,660
this mitigation technique and as you can

1385
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:59,819
see in the last three call

1386
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,328
is the fitness value of the three

1387
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:05,130
objectives so they are all non dominated

1388
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:07,890
the Pareto solutions it's ready for

1389
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:12,299
decision making decision maker to pick

1390
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:15,348
one of them so if I need to wrap it up I

1391
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:17,788
think I'm done almost done in my timing

1392
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:20,099
you can forget everything what I said

1393
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:23,130
but at least remember those bullets in

1394
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:25,109
the last slide over here we need to

1395
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,509
recognize the mismatch between the

1396
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:29,759
product life cycles of the mother system

1397
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:32,670
and the COTS hardware and software

1398
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:35,279
that's in the bill of material and coats

1399
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,769
hardware and software is not the problem

1400
00:57:35,279 --> 00:57:40,829
we have to learn how to limit that but

1401
00:57:37,769 --> 00:57:43,379
not managing the risks coming associated

1402
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:46,049
with the cost hardware and software that

1403
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,119
is a problem that we need to address and

1404
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:50,220
due to the excessive use of the

1405
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,059
vulnerabilities in those called software

1406
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:56,609
it can easily lead into a national

1407
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,500
security conflict and the impact could

1408
00:57:56,609 --> 00:58:02,190
be very high if it's not properly

1409
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:05,700
addressed that's why we are proposing a

1410
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:08,190
multi criteria solution to produce like

1411
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:12,379
a a balanced approach to reflect the

1412
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:15,690
different needs of different objective

1413
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:19,890
functions and these partner last but not

1414
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:22,349
least do not let your supply chain to be

1415
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:24,299
part of your kill chain thank you very

1416
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:26,690
much for listening to me if you have

1417
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:26,690
questions

1418
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:40,550
so uh do we have any questions yes

1419
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:43,310
girls videos with sound forces I think

1420
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:46,490
there there are two two more aspect in

1421
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:50,360
the obsolescence topic here one is the

1422
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:54,350
obsolescence in the hidden obsolescence

1423
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:57,200
this means product life cycles and but

1424
00:58:54,350 --> 00:59:00,680
stay part of the product stay the same

1425
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,500
during during during this cycling so if

1426
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,629
you remember blue peel this

1427
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:10,820
vulnerability was present in Windows

1428
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:13,880
seven eight eight one and Windows 10 and

1429
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:16,550
the same code in the same kernel was

1430
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,400
there so you got a new product with the

1431
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,960
old permeability all along so this is

1432
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,170
one part of the problem and the second

1433
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:30,860
is products tends to to be driven by I

1434
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:34,880
say bigger market trends like cloud

1435
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,460
computing etc so the solutions that we

1436
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:43,510
often need in the in the military field

1437
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:46,250
are let's say a second second in a row

1438
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:48,440
so the the unframed solution that you

1439
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,900
would like to have on your ship is not

1440
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,510
the one that that you're getting as the

1441
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:57,410
best one it's just just a second second

1442
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:59,870
best one can we handle that all right so

1443
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:03,350
the first point that the race is is a

1444
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:07,339
very valid point proven look at look at

1445
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:09,200
the the software design methodologies

1446
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,940
that we're moving like being moved into

1447
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,740
like an object-oriented designs and the

1448
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,730
component based you want these are

1449
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:18,200
designs that we tend to use the existing

1450
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,600
components that we use and we know that

1451
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,850
it works fine and like a carry on this

1452
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,799
in the newer versions and guess what as

1453
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:27,170
you just said once this is called

1454
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,330
obsolete and vulnerabilities like a fine

1455
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,770
for the new version the patch is

1456
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:33,950
developed for this one but not

1457
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:37,400
necessarily for this one so this is a

1458
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:39,649
valid point for the second question I

1459
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,570
think that was look at the the answer of

1460
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,910
this like a balanced solution is would

1461
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,420
be

1462
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:47,640
the answer to your question because we

1463
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,130
all tend to look at the problem from our

1464
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,870
own angle basically the operational

1465
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,300
community like working on board ship

1466
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:56,310
they care like I want this ship this

1467
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,740
system worked basically but there are

1468
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,509
many other aspects that that needs to be

1469
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:04,290
taken into account I remember that like

1470
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:07,490
in one of the like a test activity that

1471
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:10,470
that I was being part of it I was so

1472
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,959
stubborn to agree with the system

1473
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:14,970
because it didn't meet the requirements

1474
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,550
basically we just needed like a rejected

1475
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:18,660
and one of the two stars called me in

1476
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,880
and said okay

1477
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:23,310
yeah I understand your concerns but we

1478
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,860
need this ship on the way for some other

1479
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:28,650
reasons okay so let's just go with that

1480
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:30,270
we can fix it later on so there might be

1481
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,950
something like a strategic level or some

1482
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:35,220
are there are other aspects that we

1483
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:37,109
didn't think that we didn't know but did

1484
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,480
you are like a position but they're

1485
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:41,520
valid concerns for the others that needs

1486
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,220
to be taken into account so yes you're

1487
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,810
right but we do not have the overall

1488
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:50,180
like a coverage for the information

1489
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:50,180
basically okay yes please

1490
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,990
hello my name is Maxime I'm a

1491
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,730
businessman and I'm coming from the

1492
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:01,319
industry background so I can feel the

1493
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:03,690
pain I thank you very much because you

1494
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,720
actually highlighted this question that

1495
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:09,600
I was wondering about throughout these

1496
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:13,589
three days like how military is actually

1497
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:16,170
trying to keep up with this with own

1498
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:19,920
standards but you mentioned it's 30 70

1499
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:25,860
years like thinking forward with these

1500
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:29,490
very rapidly changing cyber world so my

1501
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:33,180
point would will be that about your a

1502
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:35,959
balanced approach so in the past ten

1503
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:39,540
years we've seen this problem that

1504
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,580
basically every one or two years we have

1505
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:45,000
completely changed the vendor the

1506
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:47,430
solution the complexity of the system

1507
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,130
grew completely like in ten years like

1508
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:53,850
ten years ago we didn't have anything

1509
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:55,010
that we have now and the main point is

1510
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:57,020
that the

1511
01:02:55,010 --> 01:03:00,290
others that were trying to go for the

1512
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:03,140
balanced approach they actually achieved

1513
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,880
some kind of mediocre product that in

1514
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,569
the end of the day declined the our

1515
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,570
clients

1516
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:13,700
rejected so the Iser went for low-cost

1517
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:15,740
quickly you know replace you know every

1518
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:18,890
year there or like two years they agreed

1519
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:21,620
to completely replace the system or the

1520
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:23,960
other clients decided we want to pay

1521
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,660
more you know maybe considerably more

1522
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,480
but do you want like ten years support

1523
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,069
15 years support and actually if you

1524
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,710
like look at the market like for

1525
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:35,900
security products like the Bosch for

1526
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:37,910
instance as a vendor is still producing

1527
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,370
the same like legacy equipment they used

1528
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:44,540
to produce like 10 15 years ago for

1529
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:46,870
these sites like subway for instance or

1530
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:51,160
whatever these kind of strategic sites

1531
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:54,980
so did you have any kind of like

1532
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:57,080
validation for your methodology of

1533
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:59,210
producing some kind of balanced product

1534
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,960
and is it is it like something you've

1535
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:06,940
tried or this is like the first step

1536
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:09,830
towards some no control yeah thank you

1537
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:13,220
the model that I was I've been working

1538
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:16,520
on had only two objectives it is as a

1539
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:18,620
scope of the PhD basically so that's the

1540
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,140
last one the cybersecurity one is just

1541
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,630
like a recently added into that so for

1542
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:26,900
the two first two objectives I can

1543
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:30,980
answer that there I have a model with

1544
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,840
the use cases but for the third one no

1545
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:37,220
we don't have the use case yet but as a

1546
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:39,530
conceptual like a model I can add it up

1547
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,480
this third objective and if you can have

1548
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,030
the data basically and we can feed into

1549
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:47,200
that and see what the part of the

1550
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:50,270
solution set will come up wait thank you

1551
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,509
thank you and I think we need to fast

1552
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:56,770
forward bits or so I'm just thank you

1553
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:56,770
for your speech for the speech

1554
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:05,788
it's time for me to test the fourth seed

1555
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:07,319
actually our last speaker is mr. Daniel

1556
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:08,910
capital Mandela's senior threat

1557
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:12,239
intelligence analyst in fireEye's

1558
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:13,578
cyber-physical team sue capoeman is

1559
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,440
coming from a multidisciplinary

1560
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:18,390
background covering IT consulting

1561
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,229
journalism and architecture in the

1562
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:26,609
energy sector

1563
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:29,399
so Daniel stages yours thank you okay

1564
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:31,078
first of all thank you for everyone for

1565
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,969
being here this is the last talk of the

1566
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:34,140
day and and I was gonna be a bit

1567
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:35,489
challenging so I'm going to try to make

1568
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:39,180
it very entertaining or at least as

1569
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:40,920
quick and simple as possible to them

1570
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:43,769
that what I want to talk about right now

1571
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,869
actually follows up on what our view was

1572
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:47,488
presenting a second ago we want to get

1573
01:05:45,869 --> 01:05:49,829
more into the specific cases into what

1574
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:51,900
you can actually do and not just present

1575
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:55,079
the challenges with some ideas into how

1576
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,460
to solve some of these problems so this

1577
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,190
is the longest title you've ever seen

1578
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,019
but the big important thing here is

1579
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:04,589
information sharing and vulnerabilities

1580
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:06,479
in industrial control systems first of

1581
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:07,950
all to give some background about what

1582
01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:09,239
we mean with industrial control systems

1583
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,859
and why we mention critical

1584
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,079
infrastructure here critical

1585
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:15,180
infrastructure refers to any industry

1586
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:17,249
that is vital for let's say the

1587
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:20,069
functioning of a specific country it can

1588
01:06:17,249 --> 01:06:22,529
go from water energy to finance for

1589
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:24,538
example in this case we focus only on

1590
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:26,489
the cases that actually have to be

1591
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:29,989
industrial control systems which are

1592
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:32,759
those devices with young computers that

1593
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:35,130
basically make it possible to automate

1594
01:06:32,759 --> 01:06:37,950
processes and to monitor them so it's

1595
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,719
basically anything beyond the computer

1596
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,609
when you group it actually it's called

1597
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,719
operational technology and then

1598
01:06:41,609 --> 01:06:44,910
basically it includes for example

1599
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,450
logical controllers include sensors

1600
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:49,890
actuators safety controllers and a bunch

1601
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:54,269
of different things that we won't get

1602
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:56,098
into right now so a bit of more

1603
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:58,999
background let's go into the scary thing

1604
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:01,950
so you see where this is coming from

1605
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:04,169
basically we have seen differently from

1606
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,029
IT where we are seeing like millions of

1607
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:07,319
incidents and you know the credit card

1608
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:09,089
and then it's the data stolen is

1609
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,570
whatever in this case we've only seen

1610
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:11,250
five

1611
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:13,110
big incident and actually one of them

1612
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,910
the German steel mill is it's actually a

1613
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,990
myth it's like it exists but it doesn't

1614
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,359
no one really knows

1615
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:20,250
so the first one was just oxidant and

1616
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,800
that's when industry control system

1617
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:25,920
security was actually created what

1618
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:29,520
happens is basically warm was created to

1619
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,710
delay the Iranian nuclear process

1620
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,780
processing and while it succeeded

1621
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:36,450
that's what we know about it I'm gonna

1622
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:39,030
talk a bit more about that one but six

1623
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:41,549
years ago sorry six years later we saw

1624
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:43,020
Triton actually if fire I precisely went

1625
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,700
to one of the vasila energy facility

1626
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,070
responded to this incident where a

1627
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,500
threat actor developed malware

1628
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:51,270
specifically to target safety

1629
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,980
instrumented systems this is very

1630
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,780
important because this is not Windows is

1631
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:56,910
not Linux this is not software this is

1632
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,640
it goes much beyond that like the threat

1633
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:01,200
actor actually exploited multiple

1634
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:03,060
witnesses throughout the full chain

1635
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,919
until they got into the industrial

1636
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:07,259
network and eventually developed this is

1637
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,930
specifically for a specific product from

1638
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,850
neither electric that is whose protocols

1639
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:16,410
are not open that most people don't

1640
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:18,000
actually know even that exists so what

1641
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:20,430
we saw here in common end and the reason

1642
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,560
why this paper cake came into like an

1643
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:24,720
idea is at least four of these cases the

1644
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,450
further are well-documented share

1645
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:29,010
something which is the in all of them

1646
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:32,339
there have been known vulnerabilities

1647
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:33,870
exploited for example in Stuxnet this

1648
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:35,819
was the case there were some Microsoft

1649
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:38,640
vulnerabilities exploited so the worm

1650
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,889
was set into into Microsoft machines and

1651
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,270
they would expand let's say two logical

1652
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,970
controllers and to search for specific

1653
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:47,070
models so that it can start doing

1654
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:50,100
whatever it wanted right the same thing

1655
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:51,450
we saw in the other cases the 2015 in

1656
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,130
Ukraine for example the power outage

1657
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,450
this one is beautiful because it

1658
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,310
actually exploited for example a

1659
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:58,170
vulnerability in a machine interface

1660
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:59,550
human machine interface which is that

1661
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:01,950
beautiful screen that you see with all

1662
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:05,100
the tubes and the numbers that the

1663
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,569
engineer would use and basically it

1664
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,609
exploded this vulnerability eventually

1665
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:10,769
the reactor had access to those machine

1666
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:12,180
to those machine interfaces and there

1667
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,680
are videos actually that are public

1668
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:16,470
where you can see the engineers saying

1669
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,120
like hey what what's happening did we

1670
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:20,130
program something why is IT playing with

1671
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,479
this and well basically that was the

1672
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:25,809
attack an improvement process

1673
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,389
now but I want another thing like like

1674
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:30,729
before following up is am I saying then

1675
01:09:28,389 --> 01:09:32,769
that known vulnerabilities are the main

1676
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:34,359
cause for insecurity in critical

1677
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:36,219
infrastructure and that if we sold them

1678
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:38,170
we're gonna have safe energy facilities

1679
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:40,269
and we're gonna save the world of course

1680
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:43,328
not I just don't want to create the file

1681
01:09:40,269 --> 01:09:45,849
here it's I mean many times this happens

1682
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:47,649
no specifically vulnerability is a topic

1683
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:49,089
that we have as a low-hanging fruit is

1684
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:51,098
something that we are already sharing

1685
01:09:49,089 --> 01:09:52,959
information and that if we don't share

1686
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:54,249
it correctly which is going to help more

1687
01:09:52,959 --> 01:09:56,440
the threat actor than actually the

1688
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:58,329
person that's protecting so that is why

1689
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,249
this is very important however there are

1690
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:02,469
many other different layers of security

1691
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:04,150
that I'm not covering right now and that

1692
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:07,690
are probably much more or at least

1693
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:09,129
equally important so in terms of

1694
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:11,829
vulnerabilities what I wanted to have

1695
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:14,440
that is the ICS security community is

1696
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:16,719
very young against the IT security

1697
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,190
community IT security community when

1698
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,809
we're talking about vulnerabilities we

1699
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:22,989
have the CVS we have thousands of them

1700
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:24,429
we have methods we can just go and let's

1701
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:26,079
say apply this software that's gonna

1702
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:27,940
search for any vulnerabilities he's

1703
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:29,289
gonna you add a plug-in and then you

1704
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,268
solve them and that's patch and that's

1705
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:33,489
all it's not it simple but it's much

1706
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,979
more simple in ICS specifically you

1707
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:38,409
can't do that you can't even go and I

1708
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:39,880
mean you can't go on just the scan for

1709
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:42,039
for the vulnerabilities you can't just

1710
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,360
patch them you privilege availability so

1711
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:44,829
you can't stop the factory for one

1712
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,018
minute because something bad might

1713
01:10:44,829 --> 01:10:50,018
really happen so to give a bit more

1714
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:51,369
detail into this there are a couple of

1715
01:10:50,019 --> 01:10:54,400
things first of all what I mentioned

1716
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:56,650
they are difficult to patch it's not as

1717
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,719
simple and you can't have downtime

1718
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:00,369
it can't be simply skander queried you

1719
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,420
cannot just deploy a software and it's

1720
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:03,489
going to make it for you you actually

1721
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:05,320
have to do different cases you have to

1722
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:07,058
have test bits of your of your

1723
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,989
industrial network you have to basically

1724
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:12,190
do many different steps for analyzing

1725
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:13,718
sometimes it's not even necessary like

1726
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:16,989
most of the vices actually don't even

1727
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:18,639
have security embedded on them so many

1728
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:19,839
researchers are you like why would we

1729
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:21,909
even want to patch if if you know

1730
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,920
they're already vulnerable by themselves

1731
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:26,170
even if we don't find anything but still

1732
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,599
you know I mean there are others that do

1733
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:30,219
require that we don't have any good

1734
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:31,570
mechanisms for risk assessment because

1735
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:35,019
right now they're based on the I team

1736
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,829
models and basically difficult to track

1737
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:38,139
and identify

1738
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:40,058
so the final piece of background that

1739
01:11:38,139 --> 01:11:42,520
I'm gonna provide is that there are

1740
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:44,829
resources for ICS vulnerabilities yes

1741
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,559
the main one in terms of repositories we

1742
01:11:44,829 --> 01:11:48,940
have ics-cert so basically that one is

1743
01:11:47,559 --> 01:11:51,190
specifically for industrial control

1744
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,119
systems however it actually provides big

1745
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:54,699
spreadsheets

1746
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:56,409
sorry big sheets of information that you

1747
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:58,030
actually have to go and read it all

1748
01:11:56,409 --> 01:11:59,558
through them and you're considering that

1749
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:01,449
that an asset owner might actually be

1750
01:11:59,559 --> 01:12:02,889
going through thousands of assets so

1751
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:04,989
it's actually not practical and it

1752
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:07,000
doesn't have full information we have

1753
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:08,650
Isaacson and is a also basically

1754
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,679
organizations that share some

1755
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:13,269
information ICS vendor advisories which

1756
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,340
obviously the bender is one that knows

1757
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:17,710
better other product and finally new

1758
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:20,409
media new media obviously I'm gonna

1759
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:23,440
mention why it's so sketchy

1760
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:25,269
we're gonna get into this now

1761
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,098
so after all this background now we can

1762
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:29,380
actually get into the paper what is the

1763
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:32,559
paper about this paper is just the first

1764
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:34,329
part of a multi-phase project where what

1765
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:36,520
we want to do is to design solutions and

1766
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:39,250
so these are the solutions we adopted

1767
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,510
this user centered design a process so

1768
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:43,030
basically the first part of the process

1769
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,489
is go and ask you you sir what do they

1770
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:47,530
actually want you know not just to say I

1771
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:49,629
am the government I am the academia I am

1772
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:51,070
probably industry or whatever and I'm

1773
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:53,020
gonna design for you but actually I'm

1774
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:55,030
gonna go reach out to you and say what

1775
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,190
is he actually that you need and then

1776
01:12:55,030 --> 01:13:01,199
based on that I'm going to create this

1777
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:04,780
this product right so the first thing

1778
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:07,719
this research was basically a web survey

1779
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,190
that was the first phase here it says

1780
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:10,659
just you know number of questions the

1781
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,888
sample size we got from multiple

1782
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:15,040
industries but I'm gonna get more into

1783
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:18,099
that first thing that's important to

1784
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,869
highlight here we had 48 responses these

1785
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:22,179
are pretty small for a survey actually

1786
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:23,440
for any survey that we use however a

1787
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:25,030
couple of good things to highlight first

1788
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,098
of all they were representative in of

1789
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:29,290
the different industries second thing

1790
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,590
they were highly experienced in the

1791
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,659
field

1792
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,909
third they wanted to participate and

1793
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:36,400
here now they go this these three points

1794
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:38,980
are why what what were the challenges

1795
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,150
first of all who in here is an

1796
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:44,468
industrial control system security

1797
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:46,000
expert can you raise your hands one I

1798
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:48,670
know a second one that they raise your

1799
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,599
hand but basically we found two in the

1800
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:52,209
full conference probably

1801
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:54,459
fine five okay so the community is very

1802
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:56,800
small and that's true because it's it's

1803
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:58,840
it's really nascent and right now most

1804
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,609
of the attention has gone to IT with GIS

1805
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,679
the main attack vector but there's also

1806
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:04,030
this new new new community where you

1807
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:06,039
have to combine the engineering skills

1808
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:08,949
the IT skills and then get people in the

1809
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:10,570
middle collaborating so it's a very

1810
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:12,280
small community the second thing is

1811
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:14,469
declines they share information yeah

1812
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,239
actually it's not so easy to get

1813
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:18,280
information about this sites are

1814
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,468
normally very cryptic about it very I

1815
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,639
mean it's quite obvious why and we

1816
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:22,869
actually received some of the of the

1817
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:24,639
very important members from the

1818
01:14:22,869 --> 01:14:26,530
community to say you know I'm against

1819
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,729
sharing information as simple as that

1820
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,409
so I won't share it I need it but I

1821
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:30,820
won't share it which is important I mean

1822
01:14:29,409 --> 01:14:33,518
that's also something that we need to

1823
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:35,049
figure out how to how to address like to

1824
01:14:33,519 --> 01:14:36,519
what extent and what information is good

1825
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,260
to share what information is not good to

1826
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:40,570
share and finally lack of active

1827
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:42,249
discussion yes there is few - no

1828
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:44,409
discussion in the specific field about

1829
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:46,419
these are vulnerabilities which is very

1830
01:14:44,409 --> 01:14:48,249
different but when you go to the vendors

1831
01:14:46,419 --> 01:14:50,139
for example I mean in ICS many times

1832
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:52,030
they tell you it's a problem it's solved

1833
01:14:50,139 --> 01:14:55,719
you know we have mitre we have the CVS

1834
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:57,639
we have IT systems cool but basically

1835
01:14:55,719 --> 01:14:59,139
when they try to apply it it's not so

1836
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:01,359
simple because it's not basically what

1837
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:05,829
what is being required at this different

1838
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:08,949
level comfort which are information this

1839
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:11,139
is just a bad pun but specifically we

1840
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:13,598
found a specific literally a normal

1841
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:15,280
distribution which was very interesting

1842
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:16,449
so basically there is no consensus it's

1843
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,129
not like more people want to share it's

1844
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:19,959
a little more like less people want to

1845
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:24,820
share it's like there's no consensus

1846
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:26,889
whatsoever in terms of habits we first

1847
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,719
of all we made sure that we went through

1848
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:31,719
public that use this information that

1849
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,039
consume this information often and

1850
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:34,629
second thing that's very important to

1851
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:37,179
highlight here is that most most of them

1852
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:39,369
were motivated by IT security policies

1853
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:41,979
so basically their organizations or

1854
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:43,389
security are probably not aware or

1855
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:45,039
simply just do not have these policies

1856
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:47,139
specifically for the industrial control

1857
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:48,459
systems or Alti networks but actually

1858
01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:50,590
they were based entirely on what was

1859
01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:54,099
happening on i.t or corporate networks

1860
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:55,300
which is entirely different another

1861
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:57,309
thing in terms of habits where's

1862
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,289
information that they actually go to

1863
01:15:57,309 --> 01:16:00,879
check well they go to vulnerability

1864
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:03,190
repositories make sense that's the most

1865
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:05,380
specialized they go to

1866
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:06,489
private I see offenders make sense they

1867
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,170
are the ones that know the most of their

1868
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:09,580
products they goes to news and media

1869
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:12,040
makes sense because it's everywhere

1870
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:13,870
however it doesn't make sense because

1871
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,639
for example just for the fun since we

1872
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:17,559
need some research and when you figure

1873
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:19,659
out known vulnerabilities with fancy

1874
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,179
names just to melt down or spectra for

1875
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:23,949
example lots of people know about them

1876
01:16:22,179 --> 01:16:24,820
and everyone checks them immediately and

1877
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:26,650
you have all the information

1878
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,480
however there are other vulnerabilities

1879
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:30,250
that are far more critical and never

1880
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,759
receive attention just because I never

1881
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:36,730
got the fancy name from the media in

1882
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,080
terms of challenges first of all we

1883
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:40,419
found yeah that 46 percent were

1884
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,070
satisfied but only 11% found no barrier

1885
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,870
so absolutely everyone said there's

1886
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:45,159
something to do not really that's not

1887
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:47,260
rocket science it happens in any policy

1888
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:48,638
there's always something to improve but

1889
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:50,949
at least half of them really wanted a

1890
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:52,480
lot of things to improve and one want

1891
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:54,489
video a lot of problems with scalability

1892
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,900
I'm going to be quick because I want to

1893
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:59,138
keep on the time and not keep you here

1894
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,790
for all in terms of the needs we found

1895
01:16:59,139 --> 01:17:03,370
that people is mainly interested in the

1896
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:05,409
repositories at a large bits again it

1897
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,940
just basically makes sense however we

1898
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:08,949
highlight these yellow points because

1899
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,940
that that means that the asset owners

1900
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:13,900
were also interested in going after

1901
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:16,178
regulated forums or community driven

1902
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,769
forums given the fact that the patches

1903
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:20,020
are not so easy as I just pull a patch

1904
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:22,090
plug in and it happens there are many

1905
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:23,560
different let's say mediations

1906
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:25,690
alternative mitigations and different

1907
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:27,880
things that asset owners can do so

1908
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:29,830
basically by having DC speech this

1909
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,060
communication among the community you

1910
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,610
might actually get to better solutions

1911
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,650
however again this is not so simple I

1912
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:37,420
mean this is just a initial exploration

1913
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:40,330
and to do that we would need to look

1914
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:43,090
more into different options so the needs

1915
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:44,739
again people prioritize the quality of

1916
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:47,260
information so a lot of them believe the

1917
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:49,870
information is not up to their standards

1918
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:53,500
which many security organizations have

1919
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:55,630
actually pointed out yeah we have fewer

1920
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,920
grants nature's working on this the

1921
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:59,080
morning sometimes it's not even there so

1922
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,310
how are we going to go about getting

1923
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,019
more information from more vendors

1924
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:04,000
mainly from you know like smaller

1925
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:05,889
vendors that can't go and invest into

1926
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,239
this into this area they're interested

1927
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:09,429
also in usability accessibility of a

1928
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:10,959
platform basically interested and how to

1929
01:18:09,429 --> 01:18:15,219
use these platforms and how to consume

1930
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,420
this information so I assume led to here

1931
01:18:15,219 --> 01:18:16,900
because this is really what I wear I

1932
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,300
wanted to

1933
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:21,909
to the coupons and I want to get from

1934
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:24,219
here is first of all insights from ICS

1935
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:26,230
stakeholders for the design yes you have

1936
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:28,420
to listen to your user that's the main

1937
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:30,849
thing we if we continue doing Solutions

1938
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:32,140
piggybacking on IT portions without

1939
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:34,810
listening at the different disciplines

1940
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:36,300
and trying to connect probably we're not

1941
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:40,150
going to reach the results that we want

1942
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:42,310
the second thing is this paper offers an

1943
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:45,519
initial step it does some exploration

1944
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:47,469
however it intends suspect thoughts and

1945
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,750
to mobile as a community it intends to

1946
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:51,460
get some discussion going on it doesn't

1947
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:53,260
intensive be you know like will solve in

1948
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,090
the world it intends to say like okay we

1949
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:57,010
get some exploration look there is

1950
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:58,960
interest and there is no consensus how

1951
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:00,190
can we start going about that and then

1952
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,080
the next phases would be more about

1953
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:04,059
design so that's basically the fourth

1954
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,219
point the learnings from this research

1955
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:08,530
are intended to go into how and what

1956
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:10,510
types of platforms can we define and how

1957
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:12,309
can we define them so that this happen

1958
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:14,380
this comes more from the informatics and

1959
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:18,250
user experience perspective that we try

1960
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,480
to involve here basically this is very

1961
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:22,000
interesting because even when you go to

1962
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,059
engineering fields for example when you

1963
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,830
see a human machine interfaces

1964
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:28,600
oftentimes eyes will talk when someone

1965
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:30,940
was presenting on hey guys you know I

1966
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,650
went with some people ask them how to do

1967
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:35,919
it and then I designed this beautiful

1968
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:37,750
interfaces and people was like wow this

1969
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,730
is beautiful yeah it's actually useful

1970
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,960
if you saw some some of the other of the

1971
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,610
interfaces that are designed without

1972
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,280
taking this into consideration they're

1973
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:47,170
unreadable unusable and simply crazy I

1974
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,670
would go crazy using something like that

1975
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:51,250
so it's very important to consider

1976
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:54,070
finally the last point again which is

1977
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,690
thinking about the users reaching out to

1978
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:57,400
the specific user of Technology and this

1979
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,919
applies not only in ICS were also in IT

1980
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,629
when we go about doing now in the in the

1981
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,400
broad term when we go about doing policy

1982
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,469
when we go out doing recommendations

1983
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,969
when we go out finding solutions we

1984
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:09,640
definitely have to listen to a community

1985
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:12,310
we and this is like from my my opinion

1986
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,750
we can't just go and say we are gonna

1987
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,250
enforce this or we're gonna create this

1988
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:17,560
platform we're gonna solve the world for

1989
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:20,199
everyone unless we actually go and talk

1990
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,280
to users talk to the IT people talk to

1991
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:23,589
the engineers talk to the server

1992
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,650
security talk to the depending on the

1993
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:28,540
topic right so that was all further

1994
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:31,039
research mainly the idea is what I was

1995
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:32,959
mentioning let's go and develop

1996
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,170
these type of research so that we can

1997
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:37,909
jump into creating the actual solutions

1998
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:39,709
and well I mean yeah we're interested

1999
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:41,659
information sharing right now we just

2000
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,579
touched the other point of ICS

2001
01:20:41,659 --> 01:20:44,959
vulnerabilities however there are other

2002
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:46,249
fields for information sharing that

2003
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:47,840
should be considered like for example

2004
01:20:46,249 --> 01:20:50,269
about threats incidents and impacts

2005
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,550
there's not so simple an ICS it's almost

2006
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:54,139
right now still cryptic it's opening but

2007
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:55,429
there is a still a lot to discuss and

2008
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:58,239
for those of you searching for research

2009
01:20:55,429 --> 01:21:06,440
topics those are a beautiful ones and

2010
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:11,768
that's all thank you so uh do we have

2011
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,768
any questions because I got one oh

2012
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:15,610
there's a gentleman here

2013
01:21:16,819 --> 01:21:24,999
oh yeah I'm Marcus from Airbus have you

2014
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:28,099
I'm not I'm not gonna ICS expert but

2015
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:29,719
before starting making another product

2016
01:21:28,099 --> 01:21:32,839
or doing another solution have you

2017
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:34,609
checked the existing ones like the

2018
01:21:32,839 --> 01:21:38,869
malware information sharing portal that

2019
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:41,599
just jumps into my head yeah that with a

2020
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:45,348
little adoption through the specialties

2021
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:48,049
of the ICS world do the job you want to

2022
01:21:45,349 --> 01:21:50,959
do in terms of sharing and and just

2023
01:21:48,049 --> 01:21:54,199
having a tool ready that can cope and

2024
01:21:50,959 --> 01:21:55,938
help you definitely actually I couldn't

2025
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:58,188
get into all of that in that it's in the

2026
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,780
paper if you go we did some research

2027
01:21:58,189 --> 01:22:02,329
into all of the different mechanisms

2028
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:04,518
that we have I right now I mentioned

2029
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:06,379
them in one minute because 10 seconds

2030
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:08,539
because I couldn't but yeah definitely

2031
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:10,159
part of the idea of this design is not

2032
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:11,929
only like creating like a new innovative

2033
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,489
product that comes up and you know gets

2034
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:15,499
into the new bulk of products that we

2035
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:16,818
have it's actually using some of this

2036
01:22:15,499 --> 01:22:18,499
information that actually exists in the

2037
01:22:16,819 --> 01:22:20,239
repositories but it's thinking about how

2038
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:22,339
to improve it right now what there is

2039
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:24,589
for example is you have a mitre CVE

2040
01:22:22,339 --> 01:22:26,809
version which is great but it goes more

2041
01:22:24,589 --> 01:22:28,399
into IT it contains a lot of information

2042
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:30,679
and definitely it contains as well

2043
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,780
information for ICS but right now if you

2044
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,609
go as an asset owner you're gonna find

2045
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,989
there the information about iPhones

2046
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:38,239
you're gonna find Android you're gonna

2047
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:40,818
find it just impressive you and you know

2048
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,989
you really have to develop to research a

2049
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:44,479
lot to figure out what's going on in

2050
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:46,608
there now that one for example is very

2051
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,809
international Nvidia database in US and

2052
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:49,999
I believe other countries have very

2053
01:22:47,809 --> 01:22:51,530
similar ones that are also open and you

2054
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:54,049
can go into the API and figure out

2055
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:55,309
whatever but still again it's not icy

2056
01:22:54,049 --> 01:22:57,109
and specific the type of information

2057
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:59,479
actually for example when you go to the

2058
01:22:57,109 --> 01:23:01,249
common vulnerabilities coding system it

2059
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:02,979
actually does not reflect for ICS and

2060
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:05,978
probably not right here I don't know

2061
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:05,979
okay

2062
01:23:06,169 --> 01:23:10,909
the MIS doesn't really care about CVE or

2063
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:13,638
vulnerabilities it cares about

2064
01:23:10,909 --> 01:23:16,339
indicators of compromise and if you take

2065
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:19,219
those indicators has been a founder

2066
01:23:16,339 --> 01:23:21,619
version of your Snyder whatever that

2067
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:24,619
reflects directly to a vulnerability so

2068
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:28,518
all you need is to match a found Snyder

2069
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:29,719
version bla bla to a entry in the

2070
01:23:28,519 --> 01:23:32,679
database

2071
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:36,079
all the Snider's version blahblahblah

2072
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:37,610
have that that vulnerability totally

2073
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,440
aware the point is you can't do that so

2074
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:41,808
easy because you can't just go on queers

2075
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,909
neither stand in the facility to begin

2076
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:44,479
with first of all because I did that

2077
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:46,579
sorry

2078
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:48,590
yeah but often you shouldn't just go

2079
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:50,210
poking I mean I don't know your

2080
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,309
justification I know your specific aids

2081
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:55,070
I'm sorry just getting this diversion

2082
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:57,590
the firmware version any vulnerability

2083
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:59,719
scanner can do that yeah but the point

2084
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:01,039
is it's just you need different products

2085
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:02,539
in different information first of all

2086
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,849
I'm gonna go specifically with the CVS

2087
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:06,800
escort would you try to assess risk into

2088
01:24:04,849 --> 01:24:08,210
ICS vulnerabilities it's telling me

2089
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,979
about confidentiality integrity and

2090
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,809
availability do I care about the

2091
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:13,940
confidentiality integrity of course not

2092
01:24:11,809 --> 01:24:15,590
that's what I'm meaning more it's like

2093
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,489
adapting yeah adapting but there is like

2094
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,989
for example you're talking about a

2095
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:19,669
scanner yes you can work in a scanner

2096
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:21,228
but for example right now there are

2097
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:23,360
companies that do it differently because

2098
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:25,070
you just can't go and play a pulling

2099
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,119
Anessa stainable for example which is

2100
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:27,949
the most common and they're actually

2101
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:29,598
developing new products so that they can

2102
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:31,610
go and set it up because right now we

2103
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:33,260
have multiple protocols there multiple

2104
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:35,268
of them have never been explored right

2105
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,860
now this case of another for example no

2106
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:38,869
one had searched and thought so much

2107
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,570
about vulnerabilities in SAS before ever

2108
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:42,949
after only after Trident happened they

2109
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:45,289
started researching into that you know

2110
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:47,299
so it's just yeah I see I see the point

2111
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,130
I'm sorry back in a second ago that they

2112
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:50,719
were like yes but no no I see your point

2113
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:52,340
yeah it's definitely building upon what

2114
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,710
we have but here what I'm trying to do

2115
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:56,929
is listen to the community so that we

2116
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:58,820
can go and adapt this this product but

2117
01:24:56,929 --> 01:25:00,949
knowing what they need because otherwise

2118
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:02,840
I feel it's just we try to use the same

2119
01:25:00,949 --> 01:25:04,638
product right now everyone is like well

2120
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,059
I can't you know it's not working it's

2121
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,860
failing

2122
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:08,150
but when you get that same product and

2123
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,710
you do these small adaptations that

2124
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:12,650
companies like right now net Sanibel

2125
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:16,340
neces know so me we're trying of course

2126
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:17,808
in fire I I don't know like anyway all

2127
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,949
of all of those ideas specific companies

2128
01:25:17,809 --> 01:25:21,320
that's what they are actually trying to

2129
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:24,710
do like to go for through these products

2130
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:26,630
the scanners the ITA sir whatever

2131
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:27,860
for example ics-cert has actually if

2132
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:29,360
there are many researchers that have

2133
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:30,949
been looking into that and they go and

2134
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,820
say this information is not correct this

2135
01:25:30,949 --> 01:25:33,978
one pertains IT

2136
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:35,900
this one doesn't really work this one

2137
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:37,099
how do we go to improve that and it

2138
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,539
requires collaboration because it's not

2139
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:40,869
the right she is heard is doing a bad

2140
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:42,978
job it just that you know it's a

2141
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:46,699
gigantically enormous job to the

2142
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:48,590
so yeah so basically we agree it just

2143
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:51,409
yeah we have to begin from what we have

2144
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:54,219
but yeah it's a good question I think

2145
01:25:51,409 --> 01:25:54,219
thank you

2146
01:25:56,499 --> 01:26:03,860
okay then thank you then also let's

2147
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:12,769
continue with our session I mean you can

2148
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:16,249
take your state back so yeah do we have

2149
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:22,610
any overarching questions there is this

2150
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:24,800
is the time decided coupled so starting

2151
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:28,400
to or topic actually but actually

2152
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:34,550
related to other speakers I know it's

2153
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:36,978
like there is like the comfort level

2154
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:39,409
about sharing information about the ICS

2155
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:41,119
systems is not diverging for any ICS

2156
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:46,308
experts from your slice that's what I've

2157
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:48,380
seen and but and usually defending

2158
01:26:46,309 --> 01:26:50,209
against attacks cyber attacks usually

2159
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:52,909
like the government's responsibility but

2160
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:54,679
usually in in the nations those critical

2161
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:57,379
infrastructure usually run by private

2162
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,959
entities private companies and and I

2163
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:01,400
believe that for the current level bit

2164
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:04,249
Fincher to off sharing information

2165
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:07,789
between private and public conversations

2166
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:09,769
is not that much higher either so do you

2167
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:13,039
think that is there like a easy way or

2168
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:15,829
like not like a total key point but you

2169
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:19,459
think it is like a way to go for solving

2170
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:21,320
this problem okay just recalling the

2171
01:27:19,459 --> 01:27:22,550
question it goes into information

2172
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,690
sharing between private and public

2173
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:25,940
sector right yeah

2174
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:27,619
correct exactly I don't believe there is

2175
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,839
an easy question and it's a response to

2176
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:31,579
that basically we need to remember that

2177
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,739
you know both parts have different

2178
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:36,049
centers on the private the incentive is

2179
01:27:33,739 --> 01:27:37,789
you know they have to make money so they

2180
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:40,010
survive and they can grow at the same

2181
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:41,449
time most of the companies that I that I

2182
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:43,130
know and that the good ones are would

2183
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:44,719
that we actually know about had this

2184
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,639
sense of responsibility and they do

2185
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,619
collaborate with governments with people

2186
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,630
and you know follow different set sort

2187
01:27:48,619 --> 01:27:51,920
of guidelines that are actually said in

2188
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,360
the industry many times right like for

2189
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,159
example responsible vulnerabilities

2190
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,329
closures its government but it's also an

2191
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:57,949
industry and

2192
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:59,750
you know from the type of government

2193
01:27:57,949 --> 01:28:01,070
well you just care about protection and

2194
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:04,849
you're not gonna care that much about

2195
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:06,949
the financial incentives I there is a

2196
01:28:04,849 --> 01:28:09,469
lot of collaboration between private and

2197
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:13,070
public sector I think it is really

2198
01:28:09,469 --> 01:28:15,290
really useful and unfortunately I can't

2199
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:16,400
find an easy solution but hopefully

2200
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,619
we'll continue to grow in that direction

2201
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:23,239
because obviously no one did actually so

2202
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:27,019
far but ya know how to ask and for it's

2203
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:29,629
like working question regarding the

2204
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:31,909
enhancing this cyber effects the do you

2205
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,280
think that the integration of indication

2206
01:28:31,909 --> 01:28:36,138
warning methodologies or taking

2207
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,869
necessary measures with regard to using

2208
01:28:36,139 --> 01:28:42,199
courts or increased awareness against

2209
01:28:38,869 --> 01:28:43,940
cyber threats against ICS systems do you

2210
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:45,379
think that this kind of activities will

2211
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,009
make the task more difficult than it

2212
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,020
already is

2213
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:50,090
like from opposite side like for the

2214
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,010
enhancing cyber effects or like maybe

2215
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:56,570
mitigate them when it's there's seed

2216
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:59,000
level I think I mean it's like a can

2217
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:04,099
even bounce the ball yeah

2218
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,690
I focused for more in cyber effects but

2219
01:29:04,099 --> 01:29:08,300
I was one of my sliders said we have to

2220
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:10,280
first defend their own systems and it's

2221
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,349
already very hard it's almost impossible

2222
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:15,469
nowadays and we're disconnecting this

2223
01:29:12,349 --> 01:29:17,480
ICS systems to the old grid if he has

2224
01:29:15,469 --> 01:29:20,900
even worse so it's becoming really a

2225
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:22,909
system of systems and I don't know where

2226
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,980
the end is but sharing of information on

2227
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:26,808
all sides ICS defensive offensive

2228
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:33,110
forever I think is the only key for

2229
01:29:26,809 --> 01:29:35,389
success in this one do markswoman well I

2230
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:37,339
can only add like as bread brought it

2231
01:29:35,389 --> 01:29:40,250
out but currently we're much more

2232
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:42,020
focused on the offensive cyber offensive

2233
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,520
side of the cyber affects basically but

2234
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,260
there's a quite bunch of like a

2235
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,260
defensive cyber affects also available

2236
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:50,719
for us that we need to explore and I can

2237
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:52,250
find a way to integrate them into our

2238
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,889
like an operational planning and

2239
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:57,139
execution processes there's a prod

2240
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:59,210
products you hear though and the

2241
01:29:57,139 --> 01:30:00,980
offensive side at the end of the day we

2242
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:03,800
are trying to find some vulnerabilities

2243
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:05,660
and exploit them and on the on the red

2244
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,460
territory

2245
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:09,290
but the same vulnerabilities we'll

2246
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:11,810
probably have in our networks as well

2247
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:14,360
and the defensive side we're trying to

2248
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:16,400
like a fix those vulnerabilities with

2249
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,639
match the offensive cyber capabilities

2250
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,250
very perishable at the end at the shelf

2251
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:25,100
so we just need to find a quote good

2252
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:28,460
balance point for the offensive side and

2253
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:31,520
the defensive side developments in the

2254
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:33,080
future and remarks I couldn't agree more

2255
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,630
with my colleagues I think information

2256
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:37,400
sharing is vital for the successful

2257
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,050
application I find that we frameworks

2258
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,639
and in this respect it's important to

2259
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:43,840
consider both technical and geopolitical

2260
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:47,360
information on malicious activities yes

2261
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,400
I agree but yeah it is difficult and

2262
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,299
that's the the normal curve the funny

2263
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,280
goal here in the background

2264
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,960
I guess that presents it's perfect it's

2265
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:56,090
like yeah we have people on both sides

2266
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,440
there's no consensus there there are

2267
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,930
improvements like she's having this

2268
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,030
vulnerability repositories just you know

2269
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:03,080
being here having these type of forums

2270
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,580
between all the stakeholders that

2271
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:10,309
already shows a lot of the collaboration

2272
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:12,080
but yeah there's still another question

2273
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:16,520
about that I'll and nothing was running

2274
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:19,040
short of time since foreign nations -

2275
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,600
how long do you think we need for this

2276
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:24,080
indication of warning mythologist to get

2277
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:26,900
matured enough to apply as like as our

2278
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:29,240
like primary framework against a cyber

2279
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:30,679
tress or during the in due time looting

2280
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,200
like we should apply also like some

2281
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,220
traditional risk management

2282
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:36,320
methodologies like you know risk impact

2283
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:38,300
risk risk probability and the risk

2284
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:43,309
exposure and you should attack with the

2285
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:45,020
highest risk exposure and so on I end up

2286
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:46,580
with frameworks provide a high level

2287
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:49,220
understanding of how one can structure

2288
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:51,620
the networks I think every organization

2289
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:53,630
should decide for itself which is the

2290
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:56,210
most appropriate approach but we

2291
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:57,710
recommend then that we frameworks to be

2292
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:00,950
one of the approaches that is considered

2293
01:31:57,710 --> 01:32:03,950
as soon as possible yeah that's right

2294
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:06,800
now so if we don't have any other

2295
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:08,300
question although we have really enjoyed

2296
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,040
the conversation here I'm going to keep

2297
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,140
it as long as possible and we run

2298
